# NPM Script Guidelines

## Commands to Avoid

- **Never run `npm run dev`** - This starts the development server which is not needed for most tasks
- **Never run `npm run build`** - This builds the production version which is not needed for development tasks

## Preferred Commands

- **Use `npm run lint`** for type checking - This runs both TypeScript checking (`tsc --noEmit`) and ESLint

## Development Workflow

- Always run `npm run lint` before suggesting code changes to ensure type safety
- Use `npm run test` for running tests

## When to Use Each Command

- **Type checking**: `npm run lint` (includes both TypeScript and ESLint)
- **Testing**: `npm run test`
- **Formatting**: `npm run format`
- **Production build**: Only when specifically asked to build for deployment
