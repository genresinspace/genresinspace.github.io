He was a member of the rock band [[The Grateful Dead]] from 1979 until his death in 1990, a longer tenure than any other keyboardist in the band.\n\nGrowing up in [[Concord, California]], Mydland took up music while in elementary school. After graduation, he played with a number of bands and recorded one album with [[Silver (band)|Silver]] before joining [[Bobby and the Midnites]] with [[Bob Weir]] and jazz veterans [[Billy Cobham]] and [[Alphonso Johnson]]. This led to an invitation to join the Dead in 1979, replacing [[Keith Godchaux]] who had decided to leave. Mydland quickly became an important member in the Dead, using a variety of keyboards including [[Hammond organ]] and various [[synthesizer]]s and singing regularly. He wrote several songs on the band's studio albums released while he was a member.\n\nAfter a tour in the early summer 1990, Mydland died of an accidental drug overdose.",
