The band was formed in the summer of 1997 with the mere intention of recording a primitive old school black metal demo and playing one show before breaking up. However, the breakup never happened, and they have since recorded two EPs and three full-length albums. They were previously signed to [[Rivel Records]], currently to Endtime Productions. They have toured US twice, and have been featured in two metal documentary films.",
