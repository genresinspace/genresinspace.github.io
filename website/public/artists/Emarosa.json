  "description": "'''Emarosa''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|ə|'|r|oʊ|s|ə}} {{respell|EM|ə|ROH|sə}}) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 2006. The band currently consists of lead guitarist and founding member ER White and lead vocalist Bradley Walden, who joined the band in 2013. The group has undergone several line-up changes throughout its career, with lead guitarist ER White being the sole remaining founding member. Originally oriented towards [[post-hardcore]] and [[alternative rock]], Emarosa has gravitated towards a more [[pop rock]] sound in recent years.\n\nUpon the band's formation, they released one [[extended play]] (EP) in 2007, titled ''This Is Your Way Out'', and shortly after, the group underwent significant line-up and sound changes, dropping their [[metalcore]] influence and leaning towards a more [[Rock music|rock]] sound. The band released their debut studio album, ''[[Relativity (Emarosa album)|Relativity]]'' (2008), which featured vocalist [[Jonny Craig]] and rhythm guitarist Jonas Ladekjaer. Their eponymous [[Emarosa (album)|second studio album]] was released in June 2010, to critical acclaim, and was Craig's final album with the group.\n\nFollowing Craig's departure, the band toured briefly with [[Tilian Pearson]] filling in on vocals before entering a period of inactivity. Eventually, Craig was formally replaced by Walden. Emarosa then released their third studio album, ''[[Versus (Emarosa album)|Versus]]'', on September 9, 2014, which peaked at No. 61 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band signed to [[Hopeless Records]] and released their fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[131 (album)|131]]'' (2016) and ''[[Peach Club]]'' (2019). The sixth, ''[[Sting (Emarosa album)|Sting]]'', was released in January 2023 through [[Out of Line Music]].",
