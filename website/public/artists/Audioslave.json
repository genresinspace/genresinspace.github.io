  "description": "'''Audioslave''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in [[Glendale, California]], in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of [[Soundgarden]]'s lead singer and rhythm guitarist [[Chris Cornell]] with [[Rage Against the Machine]] members [[Tom Morello]] (lead guitar), [[Tim Commerford]] (bass/backing vocals), and [[Brad Wilk]] (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, ''[[Out of Exile]]'', it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s [[hard rock]] and 1990s [[alternative rock]], with musical influences that included 1960s [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[rhythm-and-blues|R&B]]. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, with emphasis on Cornell's wide [[vocal range]] and Morello's unconventional [[guitar solo]]s.\n\nIn their six years together, Audioslave released three albums, received three [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. They disbanded in February 2007 after Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was leaving the band. Later that year, Cornell and Morello (under his moniker [[The Nightwatchman]]) released solo albums, and Morello, Commerford, and Wilk reunited with [[Zack de la Rocha]] for the [[Rage Against the Machine Reunion Tour]].\n\nAudioslave reunited to perform at [[Prophets of Rage]]'s Anti-Inaugural Ball, which took place on January 20, 2017.  Cornell's death later that year precluded any chance of further reunions.",
