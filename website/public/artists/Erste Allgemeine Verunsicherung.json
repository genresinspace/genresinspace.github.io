  "description": "The ''EAV'' ('''Erste Allgemeine Verunsicherung''', [[German language|German]] for \"First General Confusion/Uncertainty/'Uninsurance'\") was an Austrian band, formed in 1977 and disbanded in 2019.\n\nNino Holm first established a band called \"Anti-Pasta\",  but it was not successful and it dissolved after three years. Holm then decided together with his friend Thomas Spitzer to create a new band.  While they were undecided on a name, they saw a bus stop in a branch of \"Erste Allgemeine Versicherung\" (\"First General Insurance\"), abbreviated EAV, and so they came to the name \"Erste Allgemeine Ver'''un'''sicherung-EAV\".\n\nThey initially faced legal difficulty in Austria due to the (obviously intended) similarity of their band name to that of the corporation \"[[Erste Group|Erste Allgemeine Versicherung]]\".  This was later dropped and the insurance company was even known to sponsor them on a few occasions.\n\nThe EAV often changed their members. Their members as of today are Klaus Eberhartinger (Vocals), Thomas Spitzer (Guitar, Vocals), Kurt Keinrath (Guitar, Keyboard, bass guitar), Franz Kreimer (Keyboard), Alvis Reid (Bass guitar) and Aaron Thier (Drums).\n\nThe stage shows are known for lavishness in both backdrop and costumes, the latter often selected and changed for specific songs that are then acted out by either the vocalist or other members.\n\nDespite the band's failed attempt to gain international fame, they still remain quite popular in Germany and Austria.",
