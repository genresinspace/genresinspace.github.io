  "name": "Enslaved",
  "description": "'''Enslaved''' is a Norwegian [[extreme metal]] band formed by [[Ivar Bjørnson]] and [[Grutle Kjellson]] in [[Haugesund]] in 1991. They are currently based in [[Bergen]]. The band's lineup has changed many times over the years, with Bjørnson and Kjellson being the sole constant members. The current lineup also includes lead guitarist [[Arve Isdal]], keyboardist/singer Håkon Vinje, and drummer Iver Sandøy.\n\nThe band's music draws heavily on the Viking cultural and religious heritage of their home country of Norway for inspiration, and most of the band's lyrics relate to [[Norse mythology]]. Though they began as a traditional [[black metal]] band, their sound has undergone significant changes over time resulting in a more progressive sound. In 2014, members of Enslaved were commissioned by the Norwegian government to create a musical piece in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution]]. This was later released as a studio album called ''Skuggsjá'' (lit: Shadow watch) in 2016. To date, the band has released sixteen full-length studio albums; the most recent of which, ''[[Heimdal (album)|Heimdal]]'', was released in March 2023.",
