Most famously a member of [[John Coltrane]]'s quartet, with whom he recorded from late 1960 to late 1965, Jones appeared on such albums as ''[[My Favorite Things (John Coltrane album)|My Favorite Things]]'', ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', ''[[Ascension (John Coltrane album)|Ascension]]'' and ''[[Live at Birdland (John Coltrane album)|Live at Birdland]]''. After 1966, Jones led his own trio, and later larger groups under the name ''The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine''. His brothers [[Hank Jones|Hank]] and [[Thad Jones|Thad]] were also celebrated jazz musicians with whom he occasionally recorded. Elvin was inducted into the ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' Hall of Fame in 1995. In his ''The History of Jazz'', jazz historian and critic [[Ted Gioia]] calls Jones \"one of the most influential drummers in the history of jazz\".
