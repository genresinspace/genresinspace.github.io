  "description": "'''Geordie Wade Greep''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɔːr|d|i|_|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|p}} {{respell|JOR|dee|_|GREEP}}; born 20 August 1999) is an English musician. From 2017 to 2024, he was the [[Lead vocalist|frontman]] and [[lead guitarist]] of the rock band [[Black Midi]], part of [[British rock music#Early 2020s|British rock music's]] [[Windmill scene]].\n\nWhile attending the [[BRIT School]], he met Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin, Cameron Picton, and Morgan Simpson; together they went on to form Black Midi. The group began performing live at [[Brixton]] pub The Windmill, the only venue to reply to Greep's emails requesting gigs.\n\nAfter signing with [[Rough Trade Records]] in 2019, the band enjoyed critical acclaim with their three studio albums, ''[[Schlagenheim]]'', ''[[Cavalcade (Black Midi album)|Cavalcade]]'', and ''[[Hellfire (Black Midi album)|Hellfire]]''. Following the hiatus of Black Midi, Greep began a solo career and released his debut studio album, ''[[The New Sound]]'' via Rough Trade Records on 4 October 2024.\n\nGreep is noted for his unique singing voice, partly due to his accent, which has been described as \"geographically unclassifiable\". He often writes dramatic narratives in his songs, many of which are centered on specific characters, as seen in the Black Midi song \"[[John L]]\", for example.",
