Born in [[Queens]], a [[Boroughs of New York City|borough]] of [[New York City]], Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999–2000, he recorded his debut album, ''[[Power of the Dollar]]'', for [[Columbia Records]]. During a shooting in May 2000, he was struck by nine bullets, causing its release to be canceled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape ''[[Guess Who's Back?]]'' was discovered by Detroit rapper [[Eminem]], who signed Jackson to his label [[Shady Records]] (an imprint of [[Interscope Records]]) that year.\n\nJackson's debut studio album, ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' (2003), was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-number one singles \"[[In da Club]]\" and \"[[21 Questions]]\" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]]), and received [[RIAA certification|nonuple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Also in 2003, he launched the record label [[G-Unit Records]], namesake of [[G-Unit|a hip-hop group]] he formed two years earlier; the label's initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. His second album, ''[[The Massacre]]'' (2005), met with continued success, yielding his third number-one single, \"[[Candy Shop]]\" (featuring [[Olivia (singer)|Olivia]]). He took a lighter, more commercially oriented approach with his third and fourth albums, ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' (2007) and ''[[Before I Self Destruct]]'' (2009)—both of which witnessed critical and commercial declines—and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album, ''[[Animal Ambition]]'' (2014), which received mixed reviews. He has since focused on television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]'' (2014–2020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company [[G-Unit Films and Television Inc.]]\n\nJackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and earned [[List of awards and nominations received by 50 Cent|several accolades]], including a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]], a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]], 13 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], six [[World Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and four [[BET Awards]].

He also appeared in the war film ''[[Home of the Brave (2006 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (2006) and the crime thriller ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' (2008). ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked Jackson 17th on its \"50 Greatest Rappers\" list in 2023, and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade.
