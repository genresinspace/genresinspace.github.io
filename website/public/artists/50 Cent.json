Born in [[Queens]], a borough of New York City, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999–2000, he recorded his debut album ''[[Power of the Dollar]]'' for [[Columbia Records]]. During a shooting in May 2000, he was struck by nine bullets, causing its release to be cancelled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape, ''[[Guess Who's Back?]]'', was discovered by Detroit rapper [[Eminem]], who signed Jackson to his label [[Shady Records]], an imprint of [[Dr. Dre]]'s [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Interscope Records]] that same year.\n\nHis debut studio album, ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' (2003), was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-number one singles \"[[In da Club]]\" and \"[[21 Questions]]\" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]]), and received [[RIAA certification|nonuple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). That same year, he launched the record label [[G-Unit Records]], namesake of [[G-Unit|a hip hop group]] he formed two years prior; the label's initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers [[Lloyd Banks]] and [[Tony Yayo]]. His second album, ''[[The Massacre]]'' (2005), was met with similar success, yielding his third number-one single, \"[[Candy Shop]]\" (featuring [[Olivia (singer)|Olivia]]). He adopted a lighter, further commercially oriented approach for his third and fourth albums, ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' (2007) and ''[[Before I Self Destruct]]'' (2009)—both were met with critical and commercial declines—and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album, ''[[Animal Ambition]]'' (2014), which was met with mixed reviews. He has since focused on his career in television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series ''[[Power (TV series)|Power]]'' (2014–2020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company [[G-Unit Films and Television Inc.]]\n\nJackson has sold over 30&nbsp;million albums worldwide and earned [[List of awards and nominations received by 50 Cent|several accolades]], including a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]], a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]], thirteen [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], six [[World Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]] and four [[BET Awards]]. In his acting career, Jackson first starred in the semi-autobiographical film ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (film)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' (2005), which was critically panned. He was also cast in the war film ''[[Home of the Brave (2006 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (2006), and the crime thriller ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' (2008). ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked Jackson as 17th on their \"50 Greatest Rappers\" list in 2023, and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked ''Get Rich or Die Tryin''' and \"In da Club\" in its lists of the \"100 Best Albums of the 2000s\" and \"100 Best Songs of the 2000s\" at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.",
