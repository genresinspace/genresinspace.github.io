  "description": "'''David John Matthews''' (born January 9, 1967) is an American musician and the lead vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist for the [[Dave Matthews Band]] (DMB). \n\nMatthews was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, and moved frequently between South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States while growing up. He started playing [[acoustic guitar]] at the age of nine. \n\nFrom 1991 to 2003, Matthews predominantly focused on songwriting and performing with the Dave Matthews Band, which he started in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1991. He also has done various solo performances and produced other records. The band relentlessly toured and performed yearly for nearly two decades through 2010, beginning with college party shows and quickly growing into arena and stadium tours by the late 1990s; between 2000 and 2009, the band grossed more revenue than any other act in North America. The band's 2012 album ''[[Away from the World]]'' made them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut at number one on the ''Billboard'' charts. This record was extended to seven consecutive number one albums with the 2018 release, ''[[Come Tomorrow (album)|Come Tomorrow]].''\n\nIn addition to music, Matthews has had multiple acting roles. He has also won two Grammy Awards: one with the Dave Matthews Band in 1997 for [[Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] (\"[[So Much to Say]]\") and one in 2004 for [[Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] (\"[[Gravedigger (song)|Gravedigger]]\") from his solo album.",
