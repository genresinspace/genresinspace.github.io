  "description": "'''Darrell Lance Abbott''' (August 20, 1966 â€“ December 8, 2004), known professionally as '''Dimebag Darrell''', was an American musician. He was the guitarist of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands [[Pantera]] and [[Damageplan]], both of which he co-founded alongside his brother [[Vinnie Paul]]. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest metal guitarists of all time.\n\nA son of [[country music]] producer [[Jerry Abbott]], Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and Pantera released its debut album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'' (1983), when he was 16. Originally a [[glam metal]] musician, Abbott went by the stage name '''Diamond Darrell''' at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed with ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]'' (1984) and ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]'' (1985), before original vocalist [[Terry Glaze]] was replaced by [[Phil Anselmo]] in 1986 and ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' (1988) was released. The band's major-label debut, ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' (1990), introduced a [[groove metal]] sound to which Abbott's guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'' (1992), and the group's third major-label record, ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in 1994.\n\nTensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'' in 1996, and ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'' (2000) was the band's final studio album before its acrimonious separation in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released ''[[New Found Power]]'', the band's only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with [[David Allan Coe]] titled ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' (2006) and numerous guest [[guitar solo]]s for bands such as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. While on tour with Damageplan, [[Columbus nightclub shooting|Abbott was shot and killed]] by a deranged fan during a performance at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on December 8, 2004. Three others were shot and killed before the perpetrator was killed by a police officer.\n\nAbbott was ranked at No. 92 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011, and No. 19 on ''[[Metal Hammer|Louder]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2018. He placed at No. 5 on [[Gibson (guitar company)|Gibson]]'s list of \"The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time\" in 2015, and the same year was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by [[VH1]].",
