  "description": "'''Leonard William Hambro''', known as '''Lenny Hambro''' (October 16, 1923 â€“ September 26, 1995), was a journeyman [[jazz musician]] who played woodwinds, primarily [[alto saxophone]], with a host of bands, orchestras, and jazz notables from the early 1940s through the mid-1960s, and continued as a session musician, music producer, booking agent, and entertainment coordinator through the mid-1990s. Early in his professional career, Hambro spelled his name \"Lennie\" but changed it to the former spelling in 1954, although he was occasionally referred to as \"Lennie\" in the press as late as 1957. Hambro broke into the profession with [[Gene Krupa]] in 1942. However, he is best known for his time as manager and assistant band leader with the New [[Glenn Miller Orchestra]] under the direction of [[Ray McKinley]]. He was well known in the [[Latin Jazz]] community and was closely associated with [[Chico O'Farrill]].\n\nOf Dutch Jewish heritage and the son of a diamond setter, Hambro was born in [[the Bronx]] in October&nbsp;1923 and lived in, or in the vicinity of [[New York City]] for the majority of his life. He married singer Lynn Michels of [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], in 1960, and together they raised two boys, Lee and Larry. Hambro died of a blood clot following [[open-heart surgery]] in September&nbsp;1995, at [[Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey]]. During his lifetime, he worked over 80 recording sessions and appears as either a leader or sideman on nearly 100 LPs / CDs released in the U.S, as well as numerous foreign titles.",
