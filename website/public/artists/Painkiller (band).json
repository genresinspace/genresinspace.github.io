  "description": "'''Painkiller''' (stylized as '''PainKiller''', previously known as '''Pain Killer''') is an [[avant-garde jazz]] and [[grindcore]] band that formed in 1991. Later albums incorporated elements of [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dub music|dub]].\n\nThe three primary members of Painkiller were [[John Zorn]] on saxophone, [[Bill Laswell]] on bass guitar and [[Mick Harris]] on drums. Zorn and Laswell work in the New York [[avant-garde]] jazz music scene. Harris was the drummer for the grindcore band [[Napalm Death]]. Harris' [[blast beat]]s inspired Zorn to create his signature style, forming improvisational groups like [[Naked City (band)|Naked City]] that merged disparate genres into a unique scene. Several musicians have made guest appearances both live and in the studio, including [[Buckethead]], Kevin Sharp of [[Brutal Truth]], [[Yamatsuka Eye]], [[Mike Patton]], Koichi Makigami of [[Hikashu]], [[Justin Broadrick]] and [[G. C. Green]] of [[Godflesh]], [[Fred Frith]], and [[Keiji Haino]] of [[Fushitsusha]].\n\nHarris left the band in 1995 to dedicate himself to [[electronic music]]. Zorn and Laswell resurrected Painkiller and played with [[Yoshida Tatsuya]] of [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] on drums. [[Hamid Drake]] joined the band for Zorn's 50th Birthday shows at Tonic in New York City. That show (which also featured Patton as a guest) was released as a live album by [[Tzadik Records|Tzadik]].\n\nOn June 23, 2008, Painkiller performed Their Last Show In Citè de la musique [[Paris]], France with the original line-up of Zorn, Laswell, and Harris, along with an appearance by [[Fred Frith]] and Patton.\n\nIn early 2024 the band reunited again, though with Harris on electronics and effects rather than a conventional drum kit. They announced the release of a new album, ''Samsara'', in November 2024.",
