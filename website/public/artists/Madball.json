  "description": "'''Madball''' is an American [[New York hardcore]] band. Originated in the late 1980s as a [[side project]] of [[Agnostic Front]], the band developed after Agnostic Front's vocalist [[Roger Miret]] would let his younger half-brother [[Freddy Cricien]] take the microphone and perform lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows. Following Agnostic Front's 1992 disbandment, Madball became the members' main project and many became a part of the band who were never in Agnostic Front. They have released nine studio albums and four EPs.",
