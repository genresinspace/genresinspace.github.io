  "description": "'''Atis Indepandan''' ({{langx|en|Independent Artists}}) is a [[New York (state)|New York]]–based music group that plays in a traditional [[Twoubadou|Haitian troubadour]] style with influences from contemporary [[American folk music]] and Brazilian [[tropicália]]. They released two albums of Haitian protest songs: ''Haiti: Ki Sa Pou-N Fe? What is to Be Done?'' in 1975 and ''Haiti: Canti Di Lotta E Di Ribellione / Songs Of Struggle And Rebellion'' in 1976, during the repressive reign of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier|Jean-Claude (“Baby Doc”) Duvalier]]. Their lyrics bear a strong [[Socialism|socialist]] message, becoming a landmark in Haitian revolutionary music and reference during the struggle against the [[Duvalier dynasty|Duvalier dictatorship]].\n\nAtis Independan was founded from a first group called Vaksin-n (named after a [[bamboo flute]]). Throughout the 1960s, [[François Duvalier]] used the music of the time, inspired by English [[British rock music|rock]] and French [[Yé-yé|yéyé]], to carry out propaganda that described Haiti as a paradise island with peaceful beaches while the country was dying of hunger and children no longer had access to school. Against this disinformation, Atis Independan gathered popular songs and music more attached to traditional forms, such as [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]], [[rara music|rara]], and [[biguine]].{{cn|date=May 2025}}\n\n[[Haitian Americans|Haitian-American]] classical/folk musician [[Leyla McCalla]] covered the song \"Dodinin (Rocking)\" for her 2022 album ''Breaking the Thermometer''.",
