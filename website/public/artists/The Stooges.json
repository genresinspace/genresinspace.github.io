  "description": "'''The Stooges''' or '''Iggy and the Stooges''', originally billed as the '''Psychedelic Stooges''', were an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], in 1967 by singer [[Iggy Pop]], guitarist [[Ron Asheton]], drummer [[Scott Asheton]], and bassist [[Dave Alexander (musician)|Dave Alexander]]. Initially playing a raw, primitive style of [[rock and roll]], the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] by Iggy Pop.\n\nAfter releasing two albums – ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' (1969) and ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'' (1970) – the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with an altered lineup (with Ron Asheton replacing Dave Alexander on bass and [[James Williamson (musician)|James Williamson]] taking up guitar) to release a third album, ''[[Raw Power]]'' (1973), before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 with Ron Asheton moving back to guitar and [[Mike Watt]] on bass, and the addition of saxophonist [[Steve Mackay]], who had played saxophone on [[Fun House (The Stooges album)|''Fun House'']]. Ron Asheton died in 2009 and was replaced by James Williamson, and the band continued to play shows until 2013, when they also released their last album, ''[[Ready to Die (The Stooges album)|Ready to Die]]''. The Stooges formally announced their breakup in 2016 due to the deaths of Scott Asheton and saxophonist Steve Mackay.\n\nThe Stooges are widely regarded as a seminal [[proto-punk]] act. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2010. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them 78th on their [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. In 2007, they were awarded the Mojo Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[Mojo Awards]].",
