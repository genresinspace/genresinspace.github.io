  "description": "'''Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi''' (born January 30, 1984), also known by his [[stage name]] '''Kid Cudi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|d|i}} {{Respell|KUHD|ee}}; formerly stylized as '''KiD CuDi'''), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and fashion designer. Born and raised in [[Cleveland]], Cudi moved to [[New York City]] in pursuit of a musical career, where he first gained recognition for his song \"[[Day 'n' Nite]]\". Initially self-published on his [[MySpace]] page, the song became a [[hit song|hit]] online and served as a catalyst for Cudi to team up with record producers [[Plain Pat]] and [[Emile Haynie]] to record his first full-length project, a [[mixtape]] titled ''[[A Kid Named Cudi]]'' (2008). Its release helped Cudi rise to prominence and establish a fanbase, catching the attention of rapper [[Kanye West]]—who signed Cudi to his [[GOOD Music]] label by late 2008.\n\nWith \"Day 'n' Nite\" issued as its [[lead single]], his debut studio album, ''[[Man on the Moon: The End of Day]]'' (2009), was released to critical and commercial success. It received [[Music recording certification|quadruple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and spawned two hit singles: \"[[Make Her Say]]\" (featuring Kanye West and [[Common (rapper)|Common]]) and the [[RIAA certification|diamond]]-certified \"[[Pursuit of Happiness (song)|Pursuit of Happiness]]\" (featuring [[MGMT]] and [[Ratatat]]). His second album, ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'' (2010), was met with continued success; it received platinum certification and spawned the singles \"[[Erase Me (song)|Erase Me]]\" (featuring Kanye West) and \"[[Mr. Rager]]\". Cudi formed the rock band [[WZRD (band)|WZRD]] with long-time collaborator and producer [[Dot da Genius]]; their [[WZRD (album)|eponymous debut album]] (2012) debuted atop the [[Rock Albums|''Billboard'' Top Rock Albums]] chart.\n\nHis self-produced third album, ''[[Indicud]]'' (2013) peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, was led by the platinum-certified single \"[[Just What I Am]]\" (featuring [[King Chip]]), and served as his final release with GOOD Music. It was followed by the tepidly-received [[experimental music|experimental]] albums, ''[[Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon]]'' (2014) and ''[[Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven]]'' (2015). His sixth album, ''[[Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin']]'' (2016) saw an improvement in critical reception and was supported by the single \"[[Surfin' (Kid Cudi song)|Surfin']]\" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams]]). Cudi formed the duo [[Kids See Ghosts]] with former label boss West in 2018; they released a [[Kids See Ghosts (album)|self-titled collaborative album]] in June of that year, which was met with critical acclaim. His 2020 single, \"[[The Scotts]]\" (with [[Travis Scott]]), became his first song to peak atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], foreseeing the release of his seventh album, ''[[Man on the Moon III: The Chosen]]'' (2020) to commercial resurgence and critical praise. Cudi released his eighth album, ''[[Entergalactic (album)|Entergalactic]]'' (2022) to coincide with his adult animated TV special [[Entergalactic (TV special)|''Entergalactic'']]; both of which were critically praised. His ninth and tenth albums, the [[Trap music|trap]]-inspired ''[[Insano (album)|Insano]]'' (2024) and ''[[Insano (Nitro Mega)]]'' (2024), followed thereafter. In August 2025, he released the [[pop music|pop]] album ''[[Free (Kid Cudi album)|Free]]''.\n\nOutside of recording, Cudi has launched his own [[vanity label]]s: the now-defunct Dream On, and his label imprint since 2011, Wicked Awesome Records.
