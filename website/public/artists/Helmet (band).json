Since 2010, the band has consisted of Hamilton, drummer Kyle Stevenson, guitarist Dan Beeman and bassist Dave Case.\n\nHelmet has released nine studio albums and two compilation albums. After releasing their debut album, ''[[Strap It On]]'' (1990), on [[Amphetamine Reptile Records|Amphetamine Reptile]], Helmet signed to [[Interscope Records]] and released three albums for the label, including the highly successful ''[[Meantime (album)|Meantime]]'' (1992). Their next two albums ― ''[[Betty (Helmet album)|Betty]]'' (1994) and ''[[Aftertaste (album)|Aftertaste]]'' (1997) ― were also successful, but did not match the critical or popular acclaim of ''Meantime''.
