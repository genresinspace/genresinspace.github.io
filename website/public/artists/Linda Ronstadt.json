She released her final solo album in 2004 and her final collaborative album in 2006, and performed her final live concert in 2009. She announced her retirement in 2011 and revealed shortly afterward that she is no longer able to sing, as a result of a degenerative condition initially diagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]] but later determined to be [[progressive supranuclear palsy]].{{efn|name=Parkinson's}} Since that time, Ronstadt has continued to make public appearances, going on a number of public speaking tours in the 2010s.
