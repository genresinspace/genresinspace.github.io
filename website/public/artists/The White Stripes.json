  "description": "'''The White Stripes''' were an American rock duo formed in Detroit, Michigan, in 1997. The group consisted of [[Jack White]] (guitar, keyboards, piano, vocals) and [[Meg White]] (drums, percussion, vocals). They were a leading group of the 2000s [[Post-punk revival|indie]] and [[Garage rock|garage rock revivals]].\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, the White Stripes sought success within the [[Music of Detroit#1980s and 1990s|Detroit music scene]], releasing six singles and two albums. They first found commercial success with their acclaimed third album, ''[[White Blood Cells]]'' (2001), which propelled the band to the forefront of the garage rock movement. Their fourth album, ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' (2003), drew further success, winning the band their first [[Grammy Awards]]. It produced the single \"[[Seven Nation Army]]\", which became a [[Stadium anthem|sports anthem]] and the band's [[List of signature songs|signature song]]. They [[Experimental music|experimented]] extensively on their fifth album, ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'' (2005). They returned to their [[blues]] roots with their sixth and final album, ''[[Icky Thump]]'' (2007), which was praised like the band's earlier albums. By the end of the 2000s, the White Stripes accumulated three entries on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], eleven entries on the US [[Alternative Airplay]] chart, and thirteen entries on the [[UK singles chart]]. After a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording, the band dissolved in 2011.\n\nThe White Stripes used a [[Lo-fi music|low-fidelity]] approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of [[garage rock]] and [[blues]] influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were noted for their mysterious public image, their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover they released—and their fascination with the number three. They made selective media appearances, including [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s anthology film ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'' (2003) and the documentary ''[[Under Great White Northern Lights]]'' (2009).\n\nThe White Stripes released six studio albums, two live albums, and one compilation album. They received [[List of awards and nominations received by the White Stripes|numerous accolades]], including a [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] from six nominations and six Grammys from eleven nominations. ''White Blood Cells'' appears on the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s \"[[List of 200 Definitive Albums in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|200 Definitive Albums]]\", while both that album and ''Elephant'' appear on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\"; the latter publication also named the band the sixth greatest duo of all time in 2015.
