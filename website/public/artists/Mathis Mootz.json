  "name": "Mathis Mootz",
  "description": "'''Mathis Mootz''' is a prolific German [[electronic musician]] and [[disc jockey|DJ]]. Mootz is best known as '''The Panacea''' (until 2005, simply as '''Panacea'''), his [[drum and bass]] stage name and main musical project, and as '''m<sup>2</sup>''' (pronounced \"'''Squaremeter'''\"), his [[dark ambient]] side project and alter-ego.\n\nBorn August 18, 1976 in [[Wetzlar]], Germany, Mootz served an apprenticeship in classical music and was a member of the boy's choir of [[Windsbach]]. After studying music engineering at the [[SAE Institute]], Mootz worked with the experimental [[hip hop]]/[[illbient]] label Chrome, an offshoot of Force Inc Music Works. Over the course of several [[drum and bass]] albums and many singles, and as [[A&R]] manager for Chrome, later renamed Position Chrome, Panacea became known for pushing the bounds of the drum and bass genre into [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]] territory, and for energetic DJ sets which fused these genres in a live setting. With his side project m<sup>2</sup>, he explored a more minimal side of electronic music, first in the realm of [[glitch music|clicks 'n' cuts]], and later in the [[dark ambient]] territory pioneered by the likes of [[Lustmord]]. Mootz lives and produces in [[Sommerhausen]], a countryside town near [[WÃ¼rzburg]].\n__TOC__",
