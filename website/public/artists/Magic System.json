  "description": "'''Magic System''' is an Ivorian [[zouglou]] and [[coupé-décalé]] music group, formed in 1996 in [[Abidjan]], Ivory Coast. When it was created, the group was composed of friends, the best known of whom today are [[A'Salfo]], Goude, Tino and Manadja. The sounds drawn from zouglou ignited the African scene for more than a decade. Their songs are also used to denounce unhappiness and all forms of abuse in Ivorian society. They developed a reputation for high-energy live shows. However, dissensions arise within the group, which breaks up and gives birth to the group as it is known today with the four \"magicians\".\n\nThe music group is famous for its performance of festive theme songs, their biggest hits are the singles \"[[1er Gaou|Premier Gaou]]\" (2002), \"Un gaou à Oran\" (2004), \"Bouger Bouger\" (2005), \"C cho ça brûle\" (2006), \"Zouglou Dance\" (2007), \"[[Même pas fatigué !!!]]\" (2009), \"Ambiance à l'africaine\" (2011), \"Chérie coco\" (2011) and \"[[Magic in the Air]]\" (2014).  In 2024, their song, \"Akwaba\" was chosen as the anthem for the soccer tournament ''La Coupe Afrique des Nations'' and also won Manie Musicale.",
