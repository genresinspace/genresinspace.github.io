  "description": "'''Rammstein''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʁamʃtaɪn|}}, {{lit}} \"ramming stone\") is a German {{Lang|de|[[Neue Deutsche Härte]]|italic=no}} band formed in [[Berlin]] in 1994. The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist [[Till Lindemann]], lead guitarist [[Richard Kruspe]], rhythm guitarist [[Paul Landers]], bassist [[Oliver Riedel]], drummer [[Christoph Schneider]], and keyboardist [[Christian Lorenz|Christian \"Flake\" Lorenz]]—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the [[punk rock]] acts [[Feeling B]] and [[First Arsch]].\n\nAfter winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record [[Demo (music)|demos]] and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with [[Motor Music]]. Working with producer [[Jacob Hellner]], they released their debut album ''[[Herzeleid]]'' in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, ''[[Sehnsucht (Rammstein album)|Sehnsucht]]'', was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles \"[[Engel (song)|Engel]]\" and \"[[Du hast]]\" and the live album ''[[Live aus Berlin]]'' (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] and released ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]'' in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, \"[[Sonne (Rammstein song)|Sonne]]\", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released ''[[Reise, Reise]]'' in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: \"[[Mein Teil]]\" and \"[[Amerika (song)|Amerika]]\"; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.\n\nTheir fifth album, ''[[Rosenrot]]'', was released in 2005, and the lead single, \"[[Benzin]]\", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, ''[[Völkerball]]'', was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, ''[[Liebe ist für alle da]]'', in 2009, with its lead single, \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured [[hardcore pornography]]. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the ''[[Made in Germany 1995–2011|Made in Germany]]'' greatest hits album as well as the ''[[Rammstein in Amerika]]'' and ''[[Rammstein: Paris|Paris]]'' live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song \"[[Deutschland (song)|Deutschland]]\", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their [[Untitled Rammstein album|untitled seventh studio album]] was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany|COVID-19]] [[COVID-19 lockdowns|lockdown]]s, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, ''[[Zeit (Rammstein album)|Zeit]]'', which was released in April 2022.\n\nRammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the {{Lang|de|Neue Deutsche Härte|italic=no}} genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature [[pyrotechnics]], have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song \"[[Ich tu dir weh]]\" forced its parent album ''Liebe ist für alle da'' to be placed on the \"index\" maintained by the German [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons|Federal Review Board for Media Harmful to Minors]] and re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.",
