Crystal Castles was known for their chaotic live shows and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] melancholic homemade productions. They released many limited vinyl singles between 2006 and 2007 before releasing four studio albums between 2008 and 2016.\n\nGlass announced her departure from the band in October 2014, citing personal and professional reasons, and was soon replaced by Edith Frances. Three years later, during the band's 2017 tour, Glass accused Kath of sexual misconduct during her time in Crystal Castles, causing the remaining tour dates to be cancelled. Crystal Castles has since been inactive, having provided no updates on new material or performances since Glass's allegations.",
