  "description": "'''Orlando''' (styled '''''O''rland''o''''') were an English [[Romo]] band of the 1990s. They were one of seven core Romo acts featured by ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in their guide to the Romo scene and were subsequently cited as being \"figureheads\" of the scene. As well as substantial coverage in ''Melody Maker'', the band also received press coverage from the ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' ''[[Smash Hits]]'' and [[Penthouse (magazine)#International versions|''Penthouse UK'']].\n\nThe band consisted of [[Dickon Edwards]], Tim Chipping, Neil Turner, Mike Austen and [[Akercocke|David Gray]]. Musically, Orlando combined the synthesised [[dance-pop]] of 1990s boybands and American swingbeat acts with verbose lyrics in the general style of [[Morrissey]] and [[Richey Edwards]].",
