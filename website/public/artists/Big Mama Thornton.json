  "description": "'''Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton''' (December 11, 1926 – July 25, 1984), was an American singer and songwriter of [[blues]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].\n\nThe ''Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul'' described Thornton by saying: \"Her booming voice, sometimes 200-pound frame, and exuberant stage manner had audiences stomping their feet and shouting encouragement in R&B theaters from coast to coast from the early 1950s on\". Thornton's strong and important vocal style and her confidence on stage made her a huge influence on early blues and rock and roll, even though she rarely received proper credit and compensation for her work.\n\nThornton was the first to record [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller|Leiber and Stoller]]'s \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", in 1952, which was written for her. It became Thornton's biggest hit, selling over 500,000 copies and staying seven weeks at number one on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' R&B chart]] in 1953. According to [[New York University]] music professor Maureen Mahon, \"the song is seen as an important beginning of rock-and-roll, especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument\".\n\nThornton's other recordings include her song \"[[Ball and Chain (Big Mama Thornton song)|Ball and Chain]]\", made famous in the late 1960s by [[Janis Joplin]]. Though later recordings of her songs by other artists sold millions of copies, she was denied royalties by not holding the publishing copyrights to her creativity. Thornton died of a heart attack and liver disorders, penniless in a boarding-house in Los Angeles, California.  In 2024, Thornton was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in the musical influence category.",
