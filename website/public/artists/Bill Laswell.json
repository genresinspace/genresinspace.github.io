  "description": "'''William Otis Laswell''' (born February 12, 1955) is an American bass guitarist, record producer, and [[record label]] owner. He has been involved in thousands of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. His music draws from [[funk]], [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[Dub music|dub]], and [[ambient music|ambient]] styles.\n\nAccording to music critic Chris Brazier, \"Laswell's pet concept is 'collision music' which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out.\" Although his bands may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically. [[Material (band)|Material]] began as a noisy [[dance music]] band, but later albums concentrated on [[hip hop]], jazz, or [[spoken word]] readings by [[William S. Burroughs]]. Most versions of the band [[Praxis (band)|Praxis]] have included guitarist [[Buckethead]], but they have explored different permutations on albums.",
