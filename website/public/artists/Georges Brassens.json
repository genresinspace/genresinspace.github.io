He achieved fame through his elegant songs, characterised by harmonically complex music for voice and guitar, as well as articulate and diverse lyrics. He is considered one of France's most accomplished postwar poets. He also set to music poems by both well-known and relatively obscure poets, including [[Louis Aragon]] (''[[Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux]]''), [[Victor Hugo]] (''La Légende de la Nonne'', ''Gastibelza''), [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Jean Richepin]], [[François Villon]] (''La Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis''), and [[Antoine Pol]] (''Les Passantes'').",
