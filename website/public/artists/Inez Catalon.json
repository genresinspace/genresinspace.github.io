  "description": "'''Inez Catalon''' ({{circa}} September 23, 1913{{Ref label|ida|a|none}} â€“ November 23, 1994) was an American [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] ballad singer, who was one of the most well-known performers of the genre known as Louisiana \"home music\". These are [[a cappella]] versions of ballads and love songs, drinking songs, game songs, lullabies and waltzes performed by women in the home, passed down from earlier generations to provide entertainment for the family before radio and television existed. Home music is not considered part of the public performance repertoire of [[Cajun]] and [[zydeco]] music because the songs were sung in the home by women, rather than in the dance halls of southwestern Louisiana which featured almost exclusively male performers.\n\nCatalon was a recipient of a 1993 [[National Heritage Fellowship]] awarded by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.",
