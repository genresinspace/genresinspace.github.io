  "description": "The '''Pixies''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], formed in 1986. The original lineup of the band consisted of [[Black Francis]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Joey Santiago]] (lead guitar), [[Kim Deal]] (bass, vocals) and [[David Lovering]] (drums). The Pixies are associated with the 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom, and draw on elements including [[punk rock]] and [[surf music|surf rock]]. Their music is known for dynamic \"loud-quiet-loud\" shifts and song structures. Francis is the primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. \n\nTheir debut release was the mini-LP ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'' in 1987, followed by the album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' and released in early 1988. They followed those up with the next two albums ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'' and ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]].'' They followed it up with ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' in 1991 before breaking up in 1993. Pixies found only modest success in their home country, but were significantly more successful in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere in [[Europe]], although in their initial run the band did not find mainstream success with their studio albums. \n\nTheir popularity grew after their breakup, leading to a 2004 reunion and sold-out world tours. Deal left in 2012, and was replaced with [[Kim Shattuck]] for their 2013 tour. She was later replaced with [[Paz Lenchantin]], who became a full member in 2016. With Lenchantin, the Pixies recorded the albums ''[[Head Carrier]]'' (2016), ''[[Beneath the Eyrie]]'' (2019) and ''[[Doggerel (album)|Doggerel]]'' (2022). In 2024, Lenchantin was replaced by Emma Richardson, formerly of [[Band of Skulls]]. The ninth Pixies album, ''[[The Night the Zombies Came]],'' was released that year.\n\nTheir alternative rock sound influenced acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] and [[Weezer]].",
