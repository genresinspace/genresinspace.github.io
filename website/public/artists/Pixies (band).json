  "description": "The '''Pixies''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], in 1986. The original lineup consisted of [[Black Francis]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Joey Santiago]] (lead guitar), [[Kim Deal]] (bass, vocals) and [[David Lovering]] (drums). The Pixies are associated with the 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom, and draw on elements including [[punk rock]] and [[surf music|surf rock]]. Their music is known for dynamic \"loud-quiet-loud\" shifts and song structures. Francis is the primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. \n\nThe Pixies' debut release was the mini-LP ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'' (1987), followed by the albums ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' (1988), ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'' (1989), ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' (1990) and ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' (1991). They disbanded in 1993. The Pixies found only modest success in the US, but were more successful in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. Their alternative rock sound influenced acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] and [[Weezer]]. \n\nThe Pixies' popularity grew after their breakup, leading to a 2004 reunion and sold-out world tours. Deal left in 2012, and was replaced with [[Kim Shattuck]] for their 2013 tour. She was later replaced with [[Paz Lenchantin]], who became a full member in 2016. With Lenchantin, the Pixies recorded the albums ''[[Head Carrier]]'' (2016), ''[[Beneath the Eyrie]]'' (2019) and ''[[Doggerel (album)|Doggerel]]'' (2022). In 2024, Lenchantin was replaced by Emma Richardson, formerly of [[Band of Skulls]]. The ninth Pixies album, ''[[The Night the Zombies Came]],'' was released that year.",
