  "description": "'''Neurosis''' is an American [[post-metal]] band from [[Oakland, California]]. It was formed in 1985 by guitarist [[Scott Kelly (musician)|Scott Kelly]], bassist Dave Edwardson, and drummer [[Jason Roeder]], initially as a [[crust punk]] band. Chad Salter joined as a second guitarist and appeared on the band's 1987 debut ''[[Pain of Mind]]'' and then [[Steve Von Till]] replaced him in 1989. The following year, the lineup further expanded to include a keyboardist and a visual artist. Beginning with their third album ''[[Souls at Zero]]'' (1992), Neurosis transformed their hardcore sound by incorporating diverse influences including [[doom metal]] and [[industrial music]], becoming a major force in the emergence of the [[post-metal]] and [[sludge metal]] genres.\n\nThe band's lineup stabilized in 1995 with the addition of Noah Landis, who replaced Simon McIlroy on keyboards and electronics. That same year they formed the [[experimental music]] group [[Tribes of Neurot]] and in 1999 the record label [[Neurot Recordings]]. This line-up remained stable until 2019, when the band parted ways with Kelly after discovering his history of [[domestic violence]] against his family, though this would not come to light until August 2022 out of respect for the privacy of Kelly's family members. The band has been on hiatus since then, and there is currently no information on whether the band will continue or disband.\n\nNeurosis have garnered critical recognition over the course of their 11 studio albums. The [[BBC]] credited them with taking \"heavy music to previously unimaginable spaces ... [and shaping] metal's definitive response to the 21st century.\"",
