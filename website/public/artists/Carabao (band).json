  "description": "'''Carabao''' ({{langx|th|คาราบาว}}) are a Thai [[Rock music|rock]] / [[phleng phuea chiwit]] band popular in [[Thailand]] and other Asian countries. The group was formed in 1980 by university students [[Yuenyong Opakul]] (Aed), [[Kirati Promsaka Na Sakon Nakhon]] (Keo or Khiao) and Sanit Limsila (Khai) who met while studying at [[Mapúa Institute of Technology]] in the [[Philippines]]. The word ''[[carabao]]'' means \"buffalo\", a symbol of fighting, hard work and patience.\n\nThey are known for their [[phleng phuea chiwit]] (เพลงเพื่อชีวิต), or 'songs for life', which came to prominence through the [[protest song]]s of the 1970s political upheaval in Thailand, especially from the band [[Caravan (Thai band)|Caravan]].  Carabao have blended the acoustic / folk style of 'phuea chiwit' with other forms of [[Music of Thailand|Thai music]], western rock and country music, as well as various kinds of world music, like [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[reggae]], earning such labels as 'ethnic rockers' and 'Kings of 3Cha' or 'Rolling Stones of Asia'. ''[[MTV Asia]]'' hailed them as a \"veteran songs-for-life band\".\n\nCarabao's songs often tackle social and political issues, demanding social justice and supporting the causes of the ordinary Thai people, but they have also created love songs and more philosophical songs with greater universal themes. Lead singer / songwriter [[Aed Carabao]] is loved by many and is also famous for his sharp tongue and open criticism of corrupt politicians, big business, and environmental destruction. At least one or two songs from most of the band's albums up to the mid-'90s were banned by the government and coverage of the band rarely appeared on government TV and radio stations. Despite this, Carabao is the most popular Thai rock group of all time.",
