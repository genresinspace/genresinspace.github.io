  "description": "'''Ọlawale Ọlọfọrọ''' (born '''Olawale Ibrahim Ashimi'''; 9 May 1986), better known as '''Brymo''', is a Nigerian singer, songwriter, [[sound artist|sonic artist]], actor and author. Born and raised in [[Okokomaiko]], he started recording music in 1999 while in secondary school. Brymo's debut album, ''Brymstone'' (2007), was supported by the single \"Shawty\" and deemed a minor release. He signed a recording contract with music label [[Chocolate City (music label)|Chocolate City]] in 2010, but was accused of breaching his contract nearly three years later. Brymo's second studio album, ''[[The Son of a Kapenta]]'',  was released in 2012 and yielded the singles \"Ara\", \"Good Morning\", and \"Go Hard\". \n\nFollowing his controversial exit from Chocolate City in 2013, Brymo abandoned his career as a mainstream artist and embraced Nigeria's alternative music space. Between 2013 and 2018, he released four critically acclaimed albums: ''[[Merchants, Dealers & Slaves]]'' (2013), ''[[Tabula Rasa (Brymo album)|Tabula Rasa]]'' (2014), ''[[Klĭtôrĭs]]'' (2016) and ''[[Oṣó]]'' (2018). Music critics lauded ''Merchants, Dealers & Slaves'' and ''Tabula Rasa'' as \"masterpieces\". Brymo teamed up with three members of Skata Vibration to form A.A.A, an alternative rock band whose [[A.A.A (EP)|eponymous debut Extended Play]] (EP) was released in August 2019. In 2020, he released the hedonistic album ''[[Yellow (Brymo album)|Yellow]]'' and the five-track EP ''[[Libel (EP)|Libel]]''. The former is a departure from the dark themes of his sixth studio album ''Oṣó'', while the latter addressed the rape allegations that surfaced on Twitter that year.\n\nIn September 2021, Brymo released the bipartite albums ''[[9: Èsan]]'' and ''[[9: Harmattan & Winter]]''. Both projects include folk ballads and explore musical styles such as fusion-rock and alternative folk. His tenth studio album, ''[[Theta (album)|Theta]]'' (2022), was recorded entirely in [[Nigerian Pidgin]]. Brymo rebranded himself as a sonic artist in 2022, and has released the sonic albums ''Mansa'' (2023) and ''Petrichor'' (2025). His twelfth studio album, ''Macabre'' (2023), comprises fourteen tracks and was described by the singer as a \"reggae album sung in English\". Brymo has released books ''Oriri's Plight'' (2018), ''Verses'' (2020) and ''The Bad Tooth'' (2022), and starred in the films ''Price of Admission'' (2021) and ''[[Elesin Oba, The King's Horseman]]'' (2022).",
