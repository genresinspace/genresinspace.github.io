He was one of the pioneers of [[mbalax]] music, and \"helped to define the mbalax style of popular music in the Senegambia\" and \"had a strong influence on [[Youssou N'Dour]] and other mbalax pioneers\". He was \"something of a cult icon back in the Senegambia region, and a pioneer of the mbalax fusion style\". The mbalax, which originated from the [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] and ultra–conservative [[njuup|njuup music tradition]] sang during [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut rites]] by circumcised boys (also referred to as \"Kassak\" songs) was the foundation of Ngum's music career. He mastered many of the njuup classics and built a name for himself while at the same time developing his voice.\n\nOne of the reasons Youssou N'Dour considered him to be a major inspiration was because of his lyrics in \"noble\" [[Wolof language|Wolof]] as opposed to \"street\" Wolof.",
