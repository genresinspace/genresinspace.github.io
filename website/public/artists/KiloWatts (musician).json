He has toured across Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States since 2002.  His 2007 release ''Ground State'' was said to lead the devoted listener to a state of total hypnosis by [[Side-Line|Side-Line Magazine]].  In 2006, Igloo Magazine called his album ''Routes'' \"a lifetime of travel compressed into an hour of aural\nhead-tripping.\"  His project with Tanner Ross, entitled Voodeux, was reviewed by [[XLR8R|XLR8R Magazine]] and could only be described as \"...if maverick producers [[Ricardo Villalobos]] and Bruno Pronsato plundered [[Lustmord]]'s harddrive full of tar-black ambience...\"  His collaboration with Bluetech, called Invisible Allies, was included in Headphone Commute's Best Of 2010 collection.",
