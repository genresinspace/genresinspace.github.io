  "name": "The Isaacs",
  "description": "'''The Isaacs''' are a bluegrass [[Southern gospel]] music group consisting of mother Lily Isaacs (b. September 20, 1947), daughters Becky (b. Aug. 2, 1975) and [[Sonya Isaacs]] (b. July 22, 1974) and son Ben Isaacs (b. July 25, 1972), along with John Bowman (husband of Becky Isaacs) as an instrumentalist and songwriter. Joe Isaacs, formerly a singer and banjo player in the group, has left since his 1998 divorce from Lily Isaacs. He now does solo work on a far more localized level.\n\nFormer [[Kingsmen Quartet]] bass player, lead singer and baritone Tim Surrett was a member of group from 1997 until 2002. Surrett was married to Sonya Isaacs during this time period. They were able to hire Jesse Stockman, a fiddle player from NM (who had been playing with the prestigious bluegrass band Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver), from 2005-2010. From 2006-2008, they hired Kevin Haynie to play banjo and guitar. (Kevin is brother to Aubrey Haynie, fiddler extraordinair who is an A-list session player in Nashville having played on hundreds of recordings.) Kevin and Jesse were able to raise them to be heights instrumentally, as is evident on the \"Live from Norway\" DVD recorded when the two were in the group. With already unequaled vocal harmonies and now top tier instrumentalists, they recorded their first crossover album at StarStruck Studios (owned by Reba McEntire) in Nashville, with Mark Bright (Carrie Underwood, Rascal Flatts) as producer. This album garnered the group their first Dove Award. Thomas Wywrot was a member from 2008 to 2011. Sonya Isaacs' husband, [[Jimmy Yeary]], took his place.\n\nCurrently, the Isaacs consists of [[Sonya Isaacs|Sonya Isaacs Yeary]], Lily Isaacs, Becky Isaacs Bowman and Ben Isaacs. On August 10, 2021, they were invited to become [[List of Grand Ole Opry members|members]] of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].",
