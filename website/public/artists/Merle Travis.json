Born in [[Rosewood, Kentucky]], his songs' lyrics were often about the lives and the economic exploitation of American [[coal mining|coal miners]]. Among his many well-known songs and recordings are \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\", \"Re-Enlistment Blues\", \"[[I Am a Pilgrim]]\", and \"[[Dark as a Dungeon]]\". He is best known today, though, for his unique guitar style, still called [[Fingerstyle guitar#Travis picking|Travis picking]] by guitarists, as well as his interpretations of the rich musical traditions of his native [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]]. Travis picking is a syncopated style of guitar [[pattern picking|fingerpicking]] rooted in [[ragtime]] music in which alternating chords and bass notes are plucked by the thumb, while melodies are plucked by the index finger. He was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970 and elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1977.\n\nHe is considered by some to be one of the most influential guitarists of the 20th century.",
