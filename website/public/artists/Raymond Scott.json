  "description": "'''Raymond Scott''' (born '''Harry Warnow'''; September 10, 1908&nbsp;â€“ February 8, 1994) was an American composer, band leader, pianist and record producer. Known best in his time as a composer of [[production music]], Scott is today regarded as an early pioneer of [[electronica]]. \n\nThough Scott was never contracted to compose for animation, his music is familiar to millions because [[Carl Stalling]] adapted it in over 120 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' films produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]]. His compositions may also be heard in ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'' (which uses Scott's recordings in twelve episodes), ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[The Oblongs]]'', ''[[Batfink]]'', ''[[Puppetoons]]'', and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. The only time he composed to accompany animation was three 20-second commercial jingles for County Fair Bread in 1962.",
