  "name": "Buck Owens",
  "description": "'''Alvis Edgar''' \"'''Buck'''\" '''Owens Jr.''' (August 12, 1929 â€“ March 25, 2006) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He was the frontman for [[The Buckaroos]], which had 21 No. 1 hits on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[country music]] chart. He pioneered what came to be called the [[Bakersfield sound]], named in honor of [[Bakersfield, California]], Owens's adopted home and the city from which he drew inspiration for what he preferred to call \"American music\".\n\nWhile the Buckaroos originally featured a [[fiddle]] and retained [[pedal steel guitar]] into the 1970s, their sound on records and onstage was always more stripped-down and elemental. The band's signature style was based on simple story lines, infectious choruses, a twangy electric guitar, an insistent rhythm supplied by a prominent drum track, and high, two-part vocal harmonies featuring Owens and his guitarist [[Don Rich]].\n\nFrom 1969 to 1986, Owens co-hosted the popular [[CBS]] television variety show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' with [[Roy Clark]] (syndicated beginning in 1971). According to Owens's son [[Buddy Alan]], the accidental 1974 death of Don Rich, his closest friend, devastated him for years and impaired his creative efforts until he mounted a comeback in the late 1980s.\n\nOwens is a member of both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]].",
