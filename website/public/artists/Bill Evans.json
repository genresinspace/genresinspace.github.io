  "name": "Bill Evans",
  "description": "'''William John Evans''' (August 16, 1929&nbsp;– September 15, 1980) was an American [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] and composer who worked primarily as the leader of his trio. His use of impressionist harmony, [[block chord]]s, innovative chord voicings, and trademark rhythmically independent \"singing\" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today.\n\nBorn in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], United States, he studied classical music at [[Southeastern Louisiana College]] and the [[Mannes School of Music]], in New York City, where he majored in composition and received an [[artist diploma]]. In 1955, he moved to [[New York City]], where he worked with bandleader and theorist [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]. In 1958, Evans joined [[Miles Davis]]'s sextet, which in 1959, then immersed in [[modal jazz]], recorded ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', the best-selling jazz album of all time.\n\nIn late 1959, Evans left the Miles Davis band and began his career as a leader, forming a [[Jazz trio|trio]] with bassist [[Scott LaFaro]] and drummer [[Paul Motian]], a group now regarded as a seminal modern jazz trio. They recorded two studio albums, ''[[Portrait in Jazz]]'' and ''[[Explorations (Bill Evans album)|Explorations]]'', and two albums recorded during a 1961 engagement at New York's [[Village Vanguard]] jazz club: ''[[Sunday at the Village Vanguard]]'' and ''[[Waltz for Debby (1962 album)|Waltz for Debby]]''. A complete set (on three CDs) of their Vanguard recordings was issued decades later. However, ten days after this booking ended, LaFaro died in a car crash. After months without public performances, Evans reemerged with a new trio, now featuring [[Chuck Israels]] on bass. In 1963, Evans recorded the [[Grammy Award]] winning ''[[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]]'', a solo album produced with [[overdubbing]] technology. In 1966, he met bassist [[Eddie Gómez (musician)|Eddie Gómez]], with whom he worked for the next 11 years. In the mid-1970s, Evans collaborated with the singer [[Tony Bennett]] on two critically acclaimed albums: ''[[The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album]]'' (1975) and ''[[Together Again (Tony Bennett and Bill Evans album)|Together Again]]'' (1977).\n\nMany of Evans's compositions, such as \"[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]\" and \"[[Time Remembered]]\", have become [[Jazz standard|standards]], played and recorded by many artists. Evans received 31 Grammy nominations and seven awards, and was inducted into the [[DownBeat|''DownBeat'' Jazz Hall of Fame]].",
