  "description": "'''Johnny Jordaan''' was the pseudonym for '''Johannes Hendricus van Musscher''' (7 February 1924 â€“ 8 January 1989), a Dutch singer of popular music, in particular the genre known as ''[[levenslied]]'', a Dutch variety of the French ''[[chanson]]''. He was well known for his songs about the city of [[Amsterdam]], especially the [[Jordaan]] district (the genre dedicated to the neighborhood is known as the ''[[Jordaanlied]]''), which he sang in a typical \"hiccuping Mokum vibrato\", \"Mokum\" being the Hebrew-derived nickname for the Amsterdam inner city area. In the 1950s, Johnny Jordaan rose almost instantly to the level of national celebrity and became the \"uncrowned king of the ''Jordaanlied''\", and his hit song \"[[Geef mij maar Amsterdam]]\" is one of the songs Amsterdammers identify with most.",
