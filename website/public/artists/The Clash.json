  "description": "'''The Clash''' were an English [[Rock music|<!---Punk rock isn't the band's only genre. Many of their later songs aren't punk rock. Therefore, we should call them a rock band to be more general. --->rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1976. Billed as \"The Only Band That Matters\", they are considered one of the most influential acts in the original wave of British [[punk rock]], with their music fusing elements of [[reggae]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[ska]], and [[rockabilly]]. The band also contributed to the {{nowrap|[[post-punk]]}} and [[new wave music|new wave]] movements that followed. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Joe Strummer]], lead guitarist and vocalist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]], bassist [[Paul Simonon]], and drummer [[Topper Headon|Nicky \"Topper\" Headon]].\n\nThe Clash achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]'' (1977) and their second album ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978). Their experimental third album ''[[London Calling]]'', which was released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States, where it was released the following month. A decade later, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named ''London Calling'' the best album of the 1980s. Following continued musical experimentation on their fourth album ''[[Sandinista!]]'' (1980), the band achieved further commercial success with the release of ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), which includes the US top-10 hit \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\", helping the album to achieve a 2× platinum certification there.\n\nIn 1982, Headon left the band due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction, and Jones departed the following year. With a new lineup, the band released their final album ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' in 1985 before disbanding a few weeks later.\n\nIn January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band, including original drummer [[Terry Chimes]], were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the Clash number 28 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"]].",
