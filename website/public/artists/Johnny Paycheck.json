  "name": "Johnny Paycheck",
  "description": "'''Johnny Paycheck''' (born '''Donald Eugene Lytle'''; May 31, 1938 – February 19, 2003) was an American country music singer and songwriter. He is a notable figure in the [[Outlaw country|outlaw movement]] in [[country music]].\n\nRising from humble beginnings in [[Greenfield, Ohio]], Paycheck began performing in his teens and gained early recognition as a session musician and harmony vocalist for stars such as [[Ray Price]], [[George Jones]], and [[Faron Young]]. Adopting the stage name Johnny Paycheck in the mid-1960s, he scored several hits throughout the next decades, most notably \"[[She's All I Got#Johnny Paycheck version|She's All I Got]]\" in 1971.\n\nPaycheck reached the peak of his fame with the 1977 blue-collar anthem \"[[Take This Job and Shove It]],\" written by [[David Allan Coe]], which became a cultural phenomenon and helped solidify Paycheck's status as a defining figure of outlaw country alongside [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Merle Haggard]]. His career, however, was marked as much by turmoil as triumph, as he struggled with substance abuse, alcohol, spent time in prison, and was involved in multiple legal controversies, including a conviction for assault and a high-profile sexual misconduct case.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Paycheck's legacy endures through his raw and uncompromising music, which continues to resonate with fans of traditional and outlaw country. A member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and the subject of tribute albums and documentaries, Paycheck remained active into the early 2000s before health complications, including [[emphysema]] and [[asthma]], led to his death in 2003. His life and work have been recognized as emblematic of both the rebellion and the heartbreak that defined a pivotal era in American country music.",
