  "description": "'''Johnny Paycheck''' (born '''Donald Eugene Lytle'''; May 31, 1938 â€“ February 19, 2003) was an American [[country music]] singer and [[Grand Ole Opry]] member notable for recording the [[David Allan Coe]] song \"[[Take This Job and Shove It]]\". He achieved his greatest success in the 1970s as a force in country music's \"[[outlaw country|outlaw movement]]\" popularized by artists [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], and [[Merle Haggard]]. In 1980, Paycheck appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', though in the ensuing decade, his music career slowed due to drug, including alcohol, and legal problems. He served a prison sentence in the early 1990s, and his declining health effectively ended his career in early 2000.",
