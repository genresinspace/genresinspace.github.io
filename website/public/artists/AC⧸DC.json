Their music has been variously described as [[hard rock]], [[blues rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although the band calls it simply \"[[rock and roll]]\". They are cited as a formative influence on the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] bands. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2003 and have sold over 200 million records worldwide, making them [[List of best-selling music artists |one of the best-selling artists of all time]].\n\nAC/DC were founded by brothers [[Angus Young|Angus]] (lead guitar) and [[Malcolm Young]] (rhythm guitar), with [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]] (drums), [[Larry Van Kriedt]] (bass guitar) and [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]] (lead vocals). They underwent several line-up changes before releasing their debut [[Australasia]]n-only album, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'' (1975). Membership stabilised after the release of ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' (1977), with the Young brothers, [[Phil Rudd]] on drums, [[Cliff Williams]] on bass guitar and [[Bon Scott]] on lead vocals. Seven&nbsp;months after the release of ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' (1979), Scott died of [[alcohol poisoning]] and English singer [[Brian Johnson]] was then recruited as their new frontman. Their first&nbsp;album with Johnson, ''[[Back in Black]]'' (1980), dedicated to Scott's memory, became the [[List of best-selling albums|second&nbsp;best-selling album of all time]]. Their eighth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You|For Those About to Rock]]'' (1981), was their first&nbsp;album to reach number&nbsp;one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Rudd was fired partway through the ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'' sessions in 1983 and was replaced by [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]], who was replaced by [[Chris Slade]] six&nbsp;years later.\n\nAC/DC experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of album ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'' (1990); it was their only record to feature Slade, as Rudd returned in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' (1995). Their fifteenth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'', was the second&nbsp;highest-selling record of 2008 and their highest chart peak since ''For Those About to Rock'', eventually reaching number&nbsp;one worldwide. The band's line-up remained the same for 20&nbsp;years until 2014, when Malcolm retired due to early-onset [[dementia]], from which he died three&nbsp;years later; additionally, Rudd was charged with threatening to kill and possession of [[methamphetamine]] and [[cannabis]]. Angus and Malcolm's nephew, [[Stevie Young]], replaced Malcolm and debuted on the album ''[[Rock or Bust]]'' (2014). On the [[Rock or Bust World Tour|accompanying tour]], Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, [[Guns N' Roses]] singer [[Axl Rose]] replaced Johnson for the rest of the tour dates due to a risk of hearing loss. Williams retired at the end of the tour and the band entered a two-year hiatus. A reunion of the ''Rock or Bust'' line-up was announced in September 2020; the band's seventeenth&nbsp;studio album, ''[[Power Up (album)|Power Up]]'', was released two months later. Its [[Power Up Tour|supporting tour]] was announced in February 2024, with drummer [[Matt Laug]] and bassist [[Chris Chaney]] replacing Rudd and Williams, though both remain official members.",
