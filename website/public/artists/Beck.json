  "description": "'''Beck David Hansen''' (born '''Beck David Campbell'''; July 8, 1970), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Beck''', is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He rose to fame in the early 1990s with his [[Experimental music|experimental]] and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style, and became known for creating musical collages of wide-ranging genres. He has musically encompassed [[Folk music|folk]], [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronica]], [[alternative rock]], [[Country music|country]], and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]]. He has released 14 studio albums (three of which were released on indie labels), as well as several non-album singles and a book of sheet music.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Los Angeles]], Beck gravitated towards hip hop and folk in his teens and began to perform locally at coffeehouses and clubs. He moved to [[New York City]] in 1989 and became involved in the city's [[anti-folk]] movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he saw his commercial breakthrough with his 1993 single \"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]].\" After signing with [[DGC Records]], the song peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and served as lead single for his third album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[Mellow Gold]]'' (1994). Its follow-up, ''[[Odelay]]'' (1996), topped critic polls and won several awards. Before his 1996 release, the same year, he played the role of a taxi driver in the US video of [[Alisha's Attic]]'s single, [[I Am, I Feel]]. \n\nBeck released the country-influenced, twangy ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'' in 1998, and the funk-infused ''[[Midnite Vultures]]'' in 1999. The soft-acoustic ''[[Sea Change (album)|Sea Change]]'' in 2002 showcased a more serious Beck, and 2005's ''[[Guero]]'' returned to ''Odelay''{{'}}s [[sample (music)|sample]]-based production. ''[[The Information (Beck album)|The Information]]'' in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008's ''[[Modern Guilt]]'' was inspired by 1960s pop; and 2014's folk-infused ''[[Morning Phase]]'' won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[57th Grammy Awards]]. His 2017 album, ''[[Colors (Beck album)|Colors]]'', won awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-classical at the [[61st Annual Grammy Awards]]. His fourteenth studio album, ''[[Hyperspace (album)|Hyperspace]]'', was released on November 22, 2019. In 2022, Beck was nominated for the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\nWith a [[pop art]] collage of musical styles, oblique and [[irony|ironic]] lyrics, and [[postmodern]] arrangements incorporating [[sample (music)|samples]], [[drum machine]]s, live instrumentation and sound effects, Beck has been hailed by critics and the public throughout his musical career as being among the most idiosyncratically creative musicians of 1990s and 2000s [[alternative rock]]. Two of Beck's most popular and acclaimed recordings are ''Odelay'' and ''Sea Change'', both of which were ranked on ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]]. Beck is a four-time [[RIAA certification|platinum]] artist; he has collaborated with several artists and has made several contributions to soundtracks.",
