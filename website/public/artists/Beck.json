He moved to [[New York City]] in 1989 and became involved in the city's [[anti-folk]] movement. Returning to Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he saw his commercial breakthrough with his 1993 single \"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]].\" After signing with [[DGC Records]], the song peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and served as lead single for his third album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[Mellow Gold]]'' (1994). Its follow-up, ''[[Odelay]]'' (1996), topped critic polls and won several awards. He released the country-influenced, twangy ''[[Mutations (Beck album)|Mutations]]'' in 1998, and the funk-infused ''[[Midnite Vultures]]'' in 1999.

''[[The Information (Beck album)|The Information]]'' in 2006 was inspired by electro-funk, hip hop, and psychedelia; 2008's ''[[Modern Guilt]]'' was inspired by 1960s pop; and 2014's folk-infused ''[[Morning Phase]]'' won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[57th Grammy Awards]].
