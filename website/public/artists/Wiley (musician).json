  "name": "Wiley (musician)",
  "description": "'''Richard Kylea Cowie Jr.'''  (born 19 January 1979), better known by his stage name '''Wiley''' (formerly '''Wiley Kat'''), is a British MC and record producer. \n\nWiley is often labelled the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godfather of Grime]]\". In the early 2000s, he independently released a series of highly influential [[Grime music|eskibeat]] instrumentals on white label vinyl, such as the first in the series \"[[Eskimo (grime beat)|Eskimo]]\" and is known as a grime MC both for his solo work and for material released with his crew [[Roll Deep]].\n\nWiley first tasted success as a member of [[UK garage]] crew [[Pay As U Go]], with whom he had a top 40 hit, \"[[Champagne Dance]]\" in 2001. Wiley has continued to make grime music while also releasing mainstream singles, such as the [[UK Singles Chart]] top 10 hits \"[[Wearing My Rolex]]\", \"[[Never Be Your Woman]]\", and his UK number-one \"[[Heatwave (Wiley song)|Heatwave]]\". Wiley's eleventh album, ''[[Godfather (Wiley album)|Godfather]]'' (2017), peaked at number nine on the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming his highest-charting album of his career, and also won an \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award by ''[[NME]]''.\n\nWiley has been stabbed on several occasions. In 2008, a stabbing left him with a visible scar on the left side of his face. On 24 July 2020, Wiley made a series of posts and videos on social media, widely condemned as [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]]. Having been appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2018 New Year Honours]] for services to music, in February 2024 the [[Honours Forfeiture Committee]] formally stripped Wiley of his honour for \"bringing the honours system into disrepute\".",
