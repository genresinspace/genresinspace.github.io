  "description": "'''Hanoi Rocks''' were a Finnish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1979. They were the first Finnish band to chart in the UK and they were also popular in Japan. By 1984, the band was considered to be on the verge of an international breakthrough when they released their first major label album for [[Columbia Records|CBS]] and headed for their first US tour. The tour was however cut short when their drummer [[Razzle (musician)|Nicholas \"Razzle\" Dingley]] died in a drunk driving incident with [[Vince Neil]] behind the wheel in December 1984. The band never recovered from the loss and announced their split in June 1985. After their initial break-up, lead singer [[Michael Monroe]] became the first Finnish artist to chart on the [[Billboard 200|American Billboard 200]] in 1989. Monroe and original lead guitarist [[Andy McCoy]] reunited in 2001 with a new lineup that lasted until 2009. Although musically closer to traditional [[Rock and roll|rock n' roll]] and [[Punk rock|punk]], Hanoi Rocks has been cited as a major influence in the [[glam metal]] genre for bands such as [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] and [[Poison (band)|Poison]].\n\nAccording to Finnish radio and TV personality [[Jone Nikula]], who was the band's tour manager in the 2000s, Hanoi Rocks's albums have sold between 780,000 and 1,000,000 copies around the world, mostly in Scandinavia and Japan.\n\nThe original line-up (Michael Monroe, Andy McCoy, [[Nasty Suicide]], [[Sami Yaffa]] and [[Gyp Casino]]) reunited at Monroe's 60 year birthday concert on 23 September 2022 at the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]].",
