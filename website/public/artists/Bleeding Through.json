  "name": "Bleeding Through",
  "description": "'''Bleeding Through''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Orange County, California]], formed in 1999. Influenced largely by [[hardcore punk]] and Swedish [[melodic death metal]], the band was established by lead vocalist [[Brandan Schieppati]] as a personal project after leaving [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]]. Schieppati, who also was a member of [[Eighteen Visions]], originally balanced playing with Eighteen Visions and Bleeding Through, recording the independent albums ''[[Dust to Ashes]]'' (2001) and ''[[Portrait of the Goddess]]'' (2002) before departing Eighteen Visions to focus on Bleeding Through. The remainder of the band today comprises drummer Derek Youngsma, keyboardist Marta Demmel, and guitarists John Arnold and Brandon Richter. As of 2024, the band have sold more than 400,000 albums worldwide.\n\nIn 2003, Bleeding Through signed with [[Trustkill Records]] and released their breakthrough album, ''[[This Is Love, This Is Murderous]]''. Shortly after the album's release, the band receceived considerable media attention outside of the heavy metal community for their involvement in a van crash accidentally filmed on live television in December 2003. ''This Love'' was critically lauded and was followed by ''[[The Truth (Bleeding Through album)|The Truth]]'' (2006) and ''[[Declaration (Bleeding Through album)|Declaration]]'' (2008), both through Trustkill.\n\nThe release of ''Declaration'' was marred by financial hardship and conflicts with Trustkill; following the completion of the touring cycle for the album, the band severed ties with the label and signed to [[Rise Records]] in 2009. They released two albums through Rise, ''[[Bleeding Through (album)|Bleeding Through]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Great Fire (album)|The Great Fire]]'' (2012), before the group disbanded in 2014. They remained inactive for three years before reuniting in 2017, releasing ''[[Love Will Kill All (album)|Love Will Kill All]]'' (2018) through [[SharpTone Records]]. The band's latest album, ''[[Nine (Bleeding Through album)|Nine]]'', was released on February 14, 2025.",
