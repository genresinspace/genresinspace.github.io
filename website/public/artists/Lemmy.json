  "description": "'''Ian Fraser Kilmister''' (24 December 1945 – 28 December 2015), better known as '''Lemmy Kilmister''' or simply '''Lemmy''', was an English musician. He was the founder, lead vocalist, bassist and primary songwriter of the metal band [[Motörhead]], of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of [[Hawkwind]] from 1971 to 1975.\n\nA foundational force in the genre following the advent of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature [[sideburns|friendly mutton chops]], his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\". He was also noted for his unique posture when singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\". He was also known for his bass playing style, using his [[Rickenbacker]] bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\". A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, often playing [[power chord]]s using heavily overdriven [[Bass amplifier|tube stacks]] by [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]].\n\nLemmy was born in [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and grew up between there, the nearby towns of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]] and [[Madeley, Staffordshire|Madeley]], and later in the village of [[Benllech]], [[Anglesey]], Wales.  At a later point, Lemmy remembers living briefly at [[Gwrych Castle]], [[Abergele]]. He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of [[the Beatles]], which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s, such as [[the Rockin' Vickers]]. He worked as a [[Road crew|roadie]] for [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[the Nice]] before joining the [[space rock]] band [[Hawkwind]] in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"[[Silver Machine]]\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession. That same year, he founded Motörhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]\" and the chart-topping live album ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]'' (1981).\n\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Motörhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was known for his hard-living, road-driven lifestyle, which included [[chain-smoking]] and daily consumption of large amounts of [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[amphetamine]].",
