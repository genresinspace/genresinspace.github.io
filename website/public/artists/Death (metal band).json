  "description": "'''Death''' was an American [[death metal]] band formed in [[Altamonte Springs, Florida]], in 1983 by guitarist [[Chuck Schuldiner]] (who later became the band's sole vocalist), drummer/vocalist [[Kam Lee]] and guitarist [[Rick Rozz]]. Formed out of what would become the [[Florida death metal|Florida death metal scene]], Death is considered a pioneering band in death metal. The band's 1987 debut album, ''[[Scream Bloody Gore]]'', has been widely regarded as one of the first death metal records, alongside the first records from [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] and [[Necrophagia]].\n\nDeath had a fluctuating lineup, with Schuldiner, aside from a European tour, the sole consistent member. The group's style progressed from the raw sound on its first two albums to a more complex one in its later stage. The band disbanded after Schuldiner died of [[glioma]] and [[pneumonia]] in December 2001, but remains an enduring influence on heavy metal.",
