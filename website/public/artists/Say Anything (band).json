  "description": "'''Say Anything''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California. The band was formed in 2000 by [[Max Bemis]] and his friends, and within two years, they had self-released two EPs and a full-length album.\n\nIn 2003, the band signed with their first label, [[Doghouse Records]]. A year later, they released their second album, ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]''. To support the album, they picked up new members and began touring; however, despite rapidly growing critical and fan acclaim, Bemis' health problems, including [[bipolar disorder]] and drug addictions, sidelined the band in 2005 as five band members left during the year.\n\nSay Anything signed with [[J Records]] in 2005 and, following Bemis' successful rehabilitation, re-released ''...Is a Real Boy'' with their new label. They went on co-headlining tours with [[Saves the Day]] in 2006 and [[Hellogoodbye]] in 2007. In 2008, Say Anything went on a headlining tour across the US and UK and appeared on every date of [[Warped Tour]].\n\nBemis announced Say Anything's disbandment in 2018, months before the 2019 release of their eighth LP, ''Oliver Appropriate''. The band reunited in 2022 and released their ninth album, ''...Is Committed'', in 2024, and also released their tenth album ''The Noise of Say Anything’s Room Without...'' a year later in 2025.\n\nSay Anything are considered by some journalists to be among the greatest pop-punk bands.",
