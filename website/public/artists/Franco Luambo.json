  "name": "Franco Luambo",
  "description": "'''François Luambo Luanzo Makiadi''' (6 July 1938 – 12 October 1989) was a Congolese singer, guitarist, songwriter, bandleader, and cultural revolutionary. He was a central figure in 20th-century [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] and [[African music]], principally as the bandleader for over 20 years of [[TPOK Jazz]], the most popular and influential African band of its time and arguably of all time. He is referred to as '''Franco Luambo''' or simply '''Franco'''. Known for his mastery of [[Congolese rumba]], he was nicknamed by fans and critics \"Sorcerer of the Guitar\" and the \"Grand Maître of Zairean Music\", as well as '''Franco de Mi Amor''' by female [[fandom]]. [[AllMusic]] described him as perhaps the \"big man in African music\". His extensive musical repertoire was a social commentary on love, [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]], marriage, [[decorum]], [[politics]], [[Rivalry|rivalries]], [[mysticism]], and [[commercialism]]. In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him at number 71 on its list of the 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\n\nBorn in Sona-Bata in [[Kongo Central]] and raised in [[Kinshasa]], Franco was mentored in his youth by Congolese musicians Paul Ebengo Dewayon and Albert Luampasi, who helped introduce him to the [[Music industry and copyright in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|music industry]]. He initially performed with Luampasi's band, Bandidu, alongside Dewayon, and later worked with Dewayon's band Watam, under the auspices of the [[Loningisa]] label, managed by Greek music executive Basile Papadimitriou. After a successful audition for producer [[Henri Bowane]], Franco was signed to a long-term contract by Loningisa.{{rp|54}} In 1954, he joined LOPADI (''Loningisa de Papadimitriou''), during which period Bowane coined the moniker \"Franco\".\n\nFranco co-founded OK Jazz in 1956, which emerged as a defining force in [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] and [[African popular music]]. As the lead guitarist, Franco developed a distinctive style characterized by [[Polyrhythm|polyrhythmic]] sophistication and intricate [[Classical guitar with additional strings|multi-string]] plucking, laying the foundation for what became known as the \"[[Congolese rumba#Schools of Congolese rumba|OK Jazz School]]\".{{rp|188}} His innovative approach to the [[sebene]], the instrumental section of Congolese rumba, placed it at the [[Conclusion (music)|song's climax]] and infused it with a syncopated thumb-and-forefinger plucking technique, revolutionizing the genre. This style became central to the band's sound and was deeply rooted in ''rumba odemba'', a rhythmic and melodic tradition emanating from the [[Mongo people]] of [[Mbandaka]]. His early recordings in the 1950s, including Congolese rumba hits: \"Bato Ya Mabe Batondi Mboka\", \"Joséphine Naboyi Ye\", and \"Da Da De Tu Amor\", as well as [[Upbeat (music)|upbeat]] [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|cha-cha-chá]] hits like \"Linda Linda\", \"Maria Valenta\", and \"Alliance Mode Succès\", helped define the Congolese rumba's sound across [[Central Africa|Central]], [[East Africa|Eastern]], and parts of [[West Africa|Western Africa]], while \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\" became the band's emblematic motto.\n\nIn 1967, he became the band's co-leader alongside vocalist [[Vicky Longomba]], and when Vicky departed in 1970, Franco assumed full leadership. The following year, the band was renamed as ''Tout-Puissant Orchestre Kinois de Jazz'' (TPOK Jazz), meaning \"The Almighty Kinshasa Jazz Orchestra\". Throughout the 1970s, Franco became increasingly engaged in politics and aligned himself with President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s state ideology of ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticité]]''. He wrote several songs extolling Mobutu and his administration. By the early 1980s, a significant number of TPOK Jazz members had relocated to Europe, seeking refuge from the worsening socio-economic conditions in Kinshasa. Despite the dispersion, the band remained remarkably productive and released a series of hits: \"12 600 Lettres\" (1981), \"Lettre à Mr. Le Directeur Général\" (1983), a collaboration with [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]] and his Orchestre Afrisa International, and \"Non\" (1983). The Franco-[[Madilu System|Madilu]] duo yielded some of their standout releases: \"Mamou\" (alternately known as \"Tu Vois\", 1984), \"[[Mario (song)|Mario]]\" (1985), \"La Vie des Hommes\" (1986), and \"Batela Makila Na Ngai\" (also known as \"Sadou\", 1988). \n\nIn recognition of his musical impact, Franco was named an [[National Order of the Leopard#Notable recipients|Officer]] of the [[National Order of the Leopard]] in 1976 and was awarded the Maracas d'Or in 1982 for his influence on [[Francophonie|Francophone]] music. Though twice married, Franco's personal life was often marred by well-known infidelities. In his final years, rapid weight loss and persistent rumors of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] overshadowed his career, prompting his 1988 song \"Les Rumeurs (Baiser ya Juda)\" as a direct response. Franco died in 1989 in Mont-Godinne, [[Yvoir]], Belgium.",
