  "description": "'''Luv'''' were a Dutch [[girl group]] that scored a string of hit records in [[Continental Europe]] ([[Benelux]], Germany, Switzerland, Austria, France, Spain, Denmark, Norway and Finland) as well as Israel, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Argentina and Mexico in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The original members were [[Patty Brard]], [[José Hoebee]] and [[Marga Scheide]]. In 1979, Luv' was 'Holland's best export act' and thus received the [[Buma Export Award|Conamus Export Prize]].\n\nThe band sold more than seven million records worldwide (singles and albums). Among their greatest hits were: \"[[U.O.Me (Theme from Waldolala)|U.O.Me (Welcome to Waldolala)]]\", \"[[You're the Greatest Lover]]\", \"[[Trojan Horse (song)|Trojan Horse]]\", \"[[Casanova (Luv' song)|Casanova]]\" and \"[[Ooh, Yes I Do]]\". The formation went through line-up changes and the original singers reunited several times. They gave a farewell performance on 11 August 2012 in [[Spaarnwoude]] at the Dutch Valley Festival. Two members of the pop act have had a successful solo career in their homeland: [[Patty Brard|Patty]] as a TV personality and [[José Hoebee|José]] as a vocalist. In 2016, [[Marga Scheide|Marga]], [[José Hoebee|José]] and [[Ria Thielsch]] (who already replaced [[Patty Brard|Patty]] in 1980) decided to relaunch Luv'. In July 2017, the ladies celebrated their 40th anniversary. On 4 January 2019, the group announced another line-up change in [[De Telegraaf]]: media personality [[Chimène van Oosterhout]] replaced [[Ria Thielsch]]. The renewed trio released a [[Latin pop]]-[[reggaeton]] single entitled [[With Him Tonight]] in July 2019, twenty-five years after their last album [[All You Need Is Luv']]. On 7 February 2020, the group's management stated that Luv' stopped all their activities due to [[José Hoebee|José]]'s ill health.\n\nIn recent years, a series of reissues and remix projects has kept their legacy alive, including [[Trojan Horse (song)#2022 remix|Trojan Horse (Kav Verhouzer Remix)]], [[All You Need Is Luv']] (Remastered & Expanded Edition) on CD, vinyl, and digital platforms and a full remix album [[Only Luv' – The Matt Pop Remixes]] set for release on May 24, 2025, offering new takes on Luv's songs using the original master tapes.",
