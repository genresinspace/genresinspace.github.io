  "description": "'''DeVotchKa''' is an American multi-instrumental and vocal ensemble formed in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], in 1997. The band consists of Nick Urata (vocals, guitar, theremin, bouzouki, piano, trumpet), Tom Hagerman (violin, accordion, piano), Jeanie Schroder (sousaphone, double bass, backing vocals, flute) and Shawn King (drums, percussion, trumpet).\n\nThe band takes their name from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''devochka'' (девочка), meaning \"girl\". After releasing their first four studio albums to critical acclaim and an expanding cult fanbase, the band gained wider attention for providing the score to the 2006 [[road movie]], ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'', which increased their exposure significantly. Per ''[[The New Yorker]]'', \"Urata’s unaffected voice, which has a hint of Rocky Mountain loneliness in it, gives the group’s sound roots, whether they’re playing a raucous midway tune or a [[spaghetti Western|spaghetti-Western]] ballad.\"\n\nTo date, the band has released seven studio albums: ''[[SuperMelodrama]]'' (2000), ''Triple X Tango'' (2002), ''[[Una Volta]]'' (2003), ''[[How It Ends (DeVotchKa album)|How It Ends]]'' (2004), ''[[A Mad & Faithful Telling]]'' (2008), ''[[100 Lovers]]'' (2011) and ''This Night Falls Forever'' (2018).",
