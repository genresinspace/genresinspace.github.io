  "description": "'''ROSTANY''' (also stylised ''ROSâ€ ANY'') is a Belarusian 3-piece [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] band who, due to their peculiar stage performance style, can also be characterised as [[Alternative dance|alternative dance music]]. The trio was formed in 2012 and claimed to be, unlike most representatives of the genre, the first ''live-only [[Electro house|Electro House]]  band'' playing DJ-style music by manually performing parts note by note, as in traditional music, or triggering [[sound effect]] clips, avoiding pre-made solid [[backing track]]s or DJ playback. Since its creation the band has been a radio and TV success in Belarus, winning ''the Reload of the Year'' nomination at the Belarusian ''Song of the Year Awards 2013'' on [[Obshchenatsional'noe Televidenie|ONT National Channel]] and later nominated for ''National Awards 2014''. In 2015 the ROSTANY were invited to compose and produce a soundtrack for Belarusian National Television Awards ''Televershina'' and perform live during the nomination.\n\nROSTANY advocate the idea of bringing the human element back to the modern \"digital\" EDM stage performance and fight against [[Miming in instrumental performance|''finger syncing'']], emphasising that playing back a studio recording to the public can not be referred to as \"live performance\". ROSTANY insist that \"the audience of a live show deserve more than a play button pressed\". Their motto being \"We don't fake it - we play it\", the band received certain attention on China's club scene and was invited for the first tour around China in 2015, which was followed by 2017 tour when Rostany played their ''Electric Toys Show'' in more than 40 big cities around China.",
