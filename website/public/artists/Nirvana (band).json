Founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]], the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably [[Chad Channing]], before recruiting [[Dave Grohl]] in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized [[alternative rock]], and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of [[Generation X]]. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence rock culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the [[Seattle]] [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label [[DGC Records]] in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from its landmark second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991).

Following extensive touring and the 1992 compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' and EP ''[[Hormoaning]]'', the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[In Utero]]'' (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's suicide]] in April 1994. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]].
