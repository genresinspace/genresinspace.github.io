  "description": "'''Nirvana''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Aberdeen, Washington]], in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]], the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably [[Chad Channing]], before recruiting [[Dave Grohl]] in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized [[alternative rock]], and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of [[Generation X]]. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence rock culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene. They released their first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. Their sound relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to the major label [[DGC Records]] in 1990, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from its landmark second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, ''Nevermind'' was certified [[RIAA certification|13× Platinum]] in the US and is credited for ending the popularity of [[hair metal]].\n\nCharacterized by a [[Punk subculture|punk]] aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of [[Pop music|pop]] melodies with [[Noise music|noise]], combined with its themes of [[abjection]] and [[social alienation]], brought them global popularity. Following extensive touring and the 1992 compilation album ''[[Incesticide]]'' and [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Hormoaning]]'', the band released its highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[In Utero]]'' (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. However, in April 1994, Nirvana disbanded following [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|Cobain's suicide]]. Further releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow, [[Courtney Love]]. The live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Performance]] at the [[1996 Grammy Awards]].\n\nNirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold more than 75&nbsp;million records worldwide, including certified sales of 60 million in the US. During its three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], and [[Grammy Award]], as well as seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]]. The band achieved five number-one hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs]] chart and four number-one albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Nirvana 30th on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014, their first year of eligibility. In 2023, they received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].",
