He was also known as “El Rey de los Timbales,” or “The King of the Timbales.”\n\nPuente and his music have appeared in films including ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' and [[Fernando Trueba]]'s ''[[Calle 54]]''. He guest-starred on television shows, including ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'''s sixth season finale/season seven premiere two-parter \"[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]\" as himself (and one of the suspects in Mr. Burns' attempted murder, only to prove that he didn't do it because he'd rather perform a scathing song about Mr. Burns than shoot him).",
