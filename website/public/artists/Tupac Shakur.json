He is regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, one of the most influential musical artists of the 20th century, and a prominent political activist for [[Black America]]. He is among the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]], having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Some of Shakur's music addressed social injustice, political issues, and the marginalization of [[African Americans]], but he was also synonymous with gangsta rap and violent lyrics.\n\nShakur was born in [[New York City]] to parents who were [[Black Panther Party]] members. Raised by his mother, [[Afeni Shakur]], he relocated to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1988. His debut album ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' (1991) cemented him as a central figure in [[West Coast hip-hop]] for his [[political rap]] lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his subsequent albums ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...]]'' (1993) and ''[[Me Against the World]]'' (1995). His [[RIAA certification|Diamond]]-certified album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' (1996), the first hip-hop [[double album]], abandoned introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. It yielded two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-number one singles, \"[[California Love]]\" and \"[[How Do U Want It]]\". Alongside his solo career, Shakur formed the group [[Thug Life (group)|Thug Life]] and collaborated with artists like [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Dr. Dre]], and the [[Outlawz]]. As an actor, Shakur starred in the films ''[[Juice (1992 film)|Juice]]'' (1992), ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993), ''[[Above the Rim]]'' (1994), ''[[Bullet (1996 film)|Bullet]]'' (1996), ''[[Gridlock'd]]'' (1997), and ''[[Gang Related]]'' (1997).\n\nDuring his later career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including [[incarceration]]. He served eight months in prison on [[sexual abuse]] charges, but was released pending appeal in 1995. Following his release, he signed to [[Suge Knight|Marion \"Suge\" Knight]]'s label [[Death Row Records]] and became embroiled in the [[East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry]], which included a high-profile feud with his former friend [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] On September 7, 1996, Shakur was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|shot four times]] by an unidentified assailant in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Paradise, Nevada]]; he died six days later. Rumors circulated suggesting that the Notorious B.I.G. was involved; he was murdered in [[Murder of the Notorious B.I.G.|another drive-by shooting]] six months later in March 1997, while visiting Los Angeles.\n\nShakur's double-length posthumous album [[Greatest Hits (Tupac Shakur album)|''Greatest Hits'']] (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip-hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States. Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including the acclaimed ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'' (1996) under the stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified multi-platinum in the United States.
