  "description": "'''Prime Time''' was an American [[free funk]] band formed by [[Ornette Coleman]] in 1975. The band utilized Coleman's theory of [[harmolodics]] to create their music. Founding members included  guitarists [[Bern Nix]] and guitarist Charles Ellerbee, bassist [[Jamaaladeen Tacuma]], and drummers [[Denardo Coleman]] and [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]]. Later members included bassist Albert MacDowell and drummer Sabir Kamal. \n\nOrnette's first album with Prime Time was ''[[Dancing in Your Head]]'', released in 1977. Their 1988 album ''[[Virgin Beauty]]'', which featured guest appearances by [[Grateful Dead]] guitarist [[Jerry Garcia]], was their most successful, peaking at number two on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Jazz Albums chart and selling more in its first year than any previous Coleman record. Prime Time would later open for Grateful Dead at a 1993 concert at the [[Oakland Coliseum]].\n\nIn 2017, two years after Ornette's death, Denardo reunited Prime Time for a concert at [[Alice Tully Hall]] in tribute to both Ornette and Bern Nix, who had died earlier that year.",
