  "description": "'''Project X''' was a short-lived [[hardcore punk]]/[[youth crew]] band from [[New York City]], and also the name of their only release, being a five-track [[Extended play|EP]]. The band consisted of members of other prominent NYC hardcore bands [[Gorilla Biscuits]], [[Youth of Today]], [[Side by Side (band)|Side by Side]] and [[Judge (band)|Judge]].\n\nThe record had a pressing of 500, and according to the band's bio on Bridge Nine Records' website, the majority of the records sold out at a gig in [[Connecticut]]. The record was out of print for 18 years (although it was illegally bootlegged more than once during that time), but was finally re-released in 2005 on [[Bridge Nine Records]].\n\nThe 7-inch remained Project X's only recorded output. So when [[John Porcelly|Porcelly]] as a joke put ''Project X â€“ The Edge of Quarrel LP'' on his [[Maximum RocknRoll]] playlist during a [[San Francisco]] visit, record collectors began searching high and low for this fabled LP, but alas, it never existed. The band did however write one song that was only performed live, \"Can't Keep Me Down\". Later the lyrics were changed, and it became the [[Youth of Today]] song \"Live Free\" on the band's ''[[We're Not in This Alone]]'' album.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}\n\nThe band played few shows, estimated as low as five. These included some on the east coast of the United States,  including Irving Plaza, and a few during [[Youth of Today]]'s European tour in 1989.  The band played again a couple of times in 2015 while touring with Gorilla Biscuits.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}",
