  "description": "'''Iced Earth''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band currently composed of only [[Jon Schaffer]], formed in [[Tampa, Florida]], and based in [[Columbus, Indiana]]. They were formed in 1984 under the name the Rose, then Purgatory, by guitarist, main songwriter and bandleader Schaffer and original drummer Greg Seymour. Iced Earth released their [[Iced Earth (album)|debut album]] in 1990 and have since released twelve [[studio album]]s, four [[Extended play|EP]]s, three [[Compilation album|compilation]]s, three [[box set]]s, three [[live albums]] and eleven [[music videos]].\n\t\nAfter releasing the demo EP ''Enter the Realm'' (1989) and signing to [[Century Media Records]], the band released two full-length studio albums – ''[[Iced Earth (album)|Iced Earth]]'' (1990) and ''[[Night of the Stormrider]]'' (1991) – before taking a two-year hiatus from 1992 to 1994, after which the band returned with new lead vocalist [[Matt Barlow]]. Iced Earth went on to release four studio albums with him in over half a decade: ''[[Burnt Offerings (album)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1995), ''[[The Dark Saga]]'' (1996), ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Iced Earth album)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' (1998) and ''[[Horror Show (album)|Horror Show]]'' (2001).\n\nAfter ''Horror Show'', Barlow quit the band and joined the police force, while Iced Earth continued on with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]], formerly of [[Judas Priest]], on vocals. With Owens, the band released two studio albums (2004's ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'' and 2007's ''[[Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1|Framing Armageddon]]''). In late 2007, Barlow rejoined the band, and they recorded one more album with him: ''[[The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2|The Crucible of Man]]'' (2008). In 2011, Barlow once again left Iced Earth, and was replaced by [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]] frontman [[Stu Block]]. ''[[Dystopia (Iced Earth album)|Dystopia]]'', Block's first album with the group, was released that October; the album received a positive response, with some critics calling it one of Iced Earth's best albums. The group recorded two more albums with Block: ''[[Plagues of Babylon]]'' (2014) and ''[[Incorruptible (album)|Incorruptible]]'' (2017).\n\nIced Earth has had numerous lineup changes; as of 2021, there had been over thirty musicians in and out of the band since its formation, with Schaffer as the sole constant member. Following Schaffer's January 2021 arrest by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for his involvement in the [[2021 United States Capitol attack]], the rest of the lineup departed, and the band was dropped from their longtime label Century Media. Schaffer was sentenced to three years probation in 2024, and later pardoned by President [[Donald Trump]] in January 2025.",
