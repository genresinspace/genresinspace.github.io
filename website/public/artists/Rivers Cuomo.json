  "name": "Rivers Cuomo",
  "description": "'''Rivers Cuomo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|oʊ|m|oʊ}} {{respell|KWOH|moh}}; born June 13, 1970) is an American musician and the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the rock band [[Weezer]]. Cuomo was born in New York City and raised in several Buddhist communities around the northeast US until the age of 10, when his family settled in [[Connecticut]]. He played in several bands in Connecticut and California before forming Weezer in 1992.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut, the [[Weezer (Blue Album)|''Blue Album'']] (1994)'','' Cuomo enrolled at [[Harvard University]], but dropped out after recording Weezer's second album, [[Pinkerton (album)|''Pinkerton'']] (1996). He re-enrolled and graduated in 2006. Though ''Pinkerton'' is now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s and has been [[certified platinum]], it was initially a commercial and critical failure, pushing Cuomo's songwriting toward pop music for Weezer's next album, the ''[[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]]'' (2001). Weezer has released more than a dozen albums since.\n\nCuomo has released several compilations of demos, including ''[[Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo]]'' (2008), and has released thousands of home recordings on his website. He has collaborated with artists including [[Hayley Williams]], [[B.o.B|B.O.B]]., [[AJR]], [[Todd Rundgren]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]]. With the American songwriter [[Scott Murphy (musician)|Scott Murphy]], Cuomo has released two Japanese-language albums as [[Scott & Rivers]].",
