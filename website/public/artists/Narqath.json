In 1995, he and drummer, Kalma formed the Finnish [[black metal]] band [[Azaghal (band)|Azaghal]]. Kalliola has played guitar, bass and keyboards, as well as utilizing vocals for Azaghal since formation to present. Besides Azaghal, Kalliola has played in many black metal bands and bands of other genres, some of which he writes and records all the music, such as Valar. Kalliola makes use of both harsh and clean vocals in his music projects. Narqath has stated that singing in Finnish has become a part of recognizable sound for Azaghal. However, he has also had some thoughts about doing a whole album with English lyrics. Azaghal remain mostly singing in Finnish, though, because their vocalist prefers to do so.\n\nNarqath has said that when he formed Azaghal, he was influenced and inspired by the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]], but also older bands like [[Mercyful Fate]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]].\n\nTomi Kalliola is experienced in producing, mixing and mastering music for bands such as Azaghal and Wyrd. For example, he fully produced the Azaghal albums: ''Mustamaa'', ''Helvetin Yhdeks채n Piiri채'' and ''Perkeleen Luoma''.\n\nKalliola currently resides in [[Hyvink채채]], Finland.",
