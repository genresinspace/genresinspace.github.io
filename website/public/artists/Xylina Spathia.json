Session musicians that appeared in the band's albums are: Dimos Gountaroulis (cello), Giorgos Tolios (percussion), Giorgos Papazoglou (percussion), Rita Hatzinikoli (percussion), Fotis Siotas (violin) and Aristeidis Hatzistavrou (classical guitar).\n\nXylina Spathia is one of the best-selling Greek bands, along with [[Pyx Lax]] and [[Trypes]]. Today, Xylina Spathia has millions of streams on [[YouTube]], as well as various other platforms, such as [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]].",
