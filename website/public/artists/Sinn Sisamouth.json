Widely considered the \"King of Khmer Music\", Sisamouth, along with [[Ros Serey Sothea]], [[Pen Ran]], [[Mao Sareth]], and other Cambodian artists, was part of a thriving pop music scene in [[Phnom Penh]] that blended elements of [[Music of Cambodia|Khmer traditional music]] with the sounds of [[rhythm and blues]] and [[rock and roll]] to develop a [[Cambodian rock (1960s-70)|Cambodian rock]] sound. Sisamouth died during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime under circumstances that are unclear.",
