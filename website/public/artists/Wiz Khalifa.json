Raised in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, he signed with the local independent label [[Rostrum Records]] to release his debut studio album, ''[[Show and Prove]]'' (2006).

His [[Eurodance]]-influenced 2008 single \"[[Say Yeah (Wiz Khalifa song)|Say Yeah]]\" received [[urban radio]] airplay and entered both the [[Rhythmic Top 40]] and [[Hot Rap Songs]] charts, becoming his first minor hit.\n\nThomaz then parted ways with Warner Bros. and independently released his second album, ''[[Deal or No Deal (album)|Deal or No Deal]]'' (2009). He released two further mixtapes until signing with [[Atlantic Records]] in July 2010. He adopted an [[urban contemporary music|urban]] [[hip-hop]]-influenced approach for his debut single for the label, \"[[Black and Yellow]]\". A tribute to his hometown of Pittsburgh, the song peaked atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Two of his follow-up singles, \"[[Roll Up (Wiz Khalifa song)|Roll Up]]\" and \"[[No Sleep (Wiz Khalifa song)|No Sleep]]\", peaked within the top 40 of the chart; all three preceded the release of his third album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[Rolling Papers (album)|Rolling Papers]]'' (2011). Despite mixed critical reception, the album peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200.\n\nHis fourth album, ''[[O.N.I.F.C.]]'' (2012) was met with similar critical and commercial response, and supported by the singles \"[[Work Hard, Play Hard]]\" and \"[[Remember You (song)|Remember You]]\" (featuring [[the Weeknd]]). His fifth album, ''[[Blacc Hollywood]]'' (2014) became his first to debut atop the ''Billboard'' 200, and was supported by the lead single \"[[We Dem Boyz]]\". His 2015 single, \"[[See You Again]]\" (featuring [[Charlie Puth]]) was released for the [[Furious 7 soundtrack|soundtrack]] to the film ''[[Furious 7]]'', in tribute to late actor [[Paul Walker]]. The song peaked the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for 12 non-consecutive weeks, received [[RIAA certification|diamond (14× platinum)]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), earned three Grammy Award nominations, and yielded Thomaz's furthest commercial success. His sixth album, ''[[Rolling Papers 2]]'' (2018) matched its titular predecessor in chart position, and was supported by the [[sleeper hit]] single \"[[Something New (Wiz Khalifa song)|Something New]]\" (featuring [[Ty Dolla Sign]]).\n\nOutside of music, Thomaz has acted on television in [[Dickinson (TV series)|''Dickinson'']] and ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', starred alongside [[Snoop Dogg]] in the 2012 [[stoner comedy]] film ''[[Mac & Devin Go to High School]]'', and had voice roles in the animated shows ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[Duncanville (TV series)|Duncanville]]'', and ''[[Big City Greens]]''.
