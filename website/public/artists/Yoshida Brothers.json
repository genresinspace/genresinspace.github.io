  "description": "The {{Nihongo|'''Yoshida Brothers'''|吉田兄弟|Yoshida Kyōdai}} are Japanese shamisenist musicians who have released several albums on the [[Domo Records]] label.\n\nThe two brothers are performers of the [[traditional Japanese music]] style of [[Tsugaru-jamisen]] which originated in northern Japan. They debuted in 1999 in Japan as a duo playing the [[shamisen]]. Their first album sold over 100,000 copies and made them minor celebrities in Japan, a fact that surprised the Yoshida Brothers themselves.  They have since attracted an international audience.\n\nTheir music has been a fusion of the rapid and percussive [[Tsugaru-jamisen]] style along with Western and other regional musical influences. In addition to performing songs that are only on the shamisen, they also use instruments such as [[drums]] and [[synthesizers]].\n\nThe commercials for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] video game console that began airing in North America in November 2006 featured the Yoshida Brothers song \"Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)\".\n\nThe Japanese dub of [[Kubo and the Two Strings]] has an instrumental version of \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" performed by them at the request of [[Laika, LLC|Laika]].",
