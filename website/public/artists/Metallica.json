  "description": "'''Metallica''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. It was formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], and has been based in [[San Francisco]] for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of [[thrash metal]], alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Slayer]]. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Robert Trujillo]]. Guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]], who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists [[Ron McGovney]], [[Cliff Burton]] and [[Jason Newsted]] are former members of the band.\n\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' (1988), gave Metallica its first [[Grammy Award]] nomination. Its fifth album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' (1991), was a turning point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling more than 16&nbsp;million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, ''[[72 Seasons]]'', was released in 2023.\n\nIn 2000, [[Metallica v. Napster, Inc.|Metallica led the case]] against the peer-to-peer file sharing service [[Napster]], in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film ''[[Metallica: Some Kind of Monster]]'', which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, ''[[St. Anger]]'' (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside [[Dane DeHaan]] in the 2013 concert film ''[[Metallica: Through the Never]]'', in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.\n\nMetallica is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|most commercially successful bands of all time]], having sold more than 163&nbsp;million albums worldwide {{as of|2023|lc=y}}, and is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, having sold 58&nbsp;million albums in the United States {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. The band has released eleven studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the [[San Francisco Symphony]]), twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos.
