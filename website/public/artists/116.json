  "description": "'''Luis Griñán Camacho''' (d. 1961) was a Cuban independent bandleader, pianist, guitarist and record producer. He is best known for his composition \"Quimbombó\", recorded by [[Conjunto Chappottín]] among others. This famous [[son cubano]] is often miscredited to its arranger, the similarly named [[Luis Martínez Griñán]]. Between 1959 and 1960, Griñán established his own independent record label, Griñán, and released two albums as a leader. He worked with two well known arrangers of the time: trombonist [[Generoso Jiménez]] \"Tojo\" and pianist Luis Martínez Griñán \"Lilí\". He also produced albums for Orquesta Ritmo Oriental, Orquesta Ideal and Orquesta Los Maguarayeros. He died in 1961 and was survived by his wife, Oresia Madrazo, a prolific songwriter.",
