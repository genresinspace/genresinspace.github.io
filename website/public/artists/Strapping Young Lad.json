  "description": "'''Strapping Young Lad''' ('''SYL''') was a Canadian [[extreme metal]] band formed by [[Devin Townsend]] in [[Vancouver]] in 1994. The band started as a one-man studio project; Townsend played most of the instruments on the 1995 debut album, ''[[Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing]]''. By 1997, he had recruited permanent members; this line-up, which consisted of Townsend on vocals and guitar, [[Jed Simon]] on [[guitar]], [[Byron Stroud]] on bass, and [[Gene Hoglan]] on [[Drum|drums]], lasted until the band's dissolution.\n\nStrapping Young Lad's music was characterized by the use of [[polyrhythm]]ic [[riff|guitar riffing]] and drumming, [[blast beat]]s and [[wall of sound]] production. The band's musical direction was mainly determined by Townsend, whose battle with [[mental health]] and dark sense of humor were major influences on his songwriting. Townsend was also noted for his eccentric appearance and on-stage behavior, which greatly contributed to the band's intense live performances.\n\nThe band gained critical success and a growing [[Underground music|underground]] fan base from their 1997 album ''[[City (Strapping Young Lad album)|City]]''. After a hiatus between 1999 and 2002, the band released three more albums, reaching their commercial peak with the 2006 effort, ''[[The New Black]]''. Townsend disbanded Strapping Young Lad in May 2007, announcing his decision to retreat from public view while continuing to record solo albums.",
