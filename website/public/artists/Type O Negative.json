  "description": "'''Type O Negative''' was an American [[gothic metal|gothic]]/[[doom metal]] band formed in [[Brooklyn]], New York City in 1989 by [[Peter Steele]] (bass, lead vocals), [[Kenny Hickey]] (guitar, co-lead vocals), [[Josh Silver]] (keyboards, backing vocals), and [[Sal Abruscato]] (drums, percussion), who was later replaced by [[Johnny Kelly]]. Their lyrical emphasis on themes of romance, depression, and death resulted in the nickname \"the Drab Four\" (in homage to [[the Beatles]]' \"Fab Four\" moniker). The band went [[Platinum album|platinum]] with 1993's ''[[Bloody Kisses]]'', and [[Gold album|gold]] with 1996's ''[[October Rust]]'', and gained a fanbase through seven studio albums, two best-of compilations, and concert DVDs.\n\nSteele died on April 14, 2010, at the age of 48; some sources report the cause of death as heart failure brought on by an [[aortic aneurysm]], while others list [[sepsis]] caused by [[diverticulitis]]. Seven months after Steele's death, the surviving members of Type O Negative announced that they would not continue as a band.",
