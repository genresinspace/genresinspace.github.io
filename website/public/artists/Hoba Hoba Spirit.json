  "description": "'''Hoba Hoba Spirit''' is a Moroccan fusion band formed in [[Casablanca]] in 1998.

The name of the group is based on a song by [[Bob Marley]].\n\nHoba Hoba Spirit's musical style mixes [[Rock music|rock]], [[reggae]] and [[Gnawa music|gnawa]] with little pinches of hard rock. They refer to their music as \"hayha,\" meaning chaos, randomness and just pure vibes. Their lyrics are mostly in [[Darija]] ([[Moroccan dialect]]), French and sometimes English. Recurring themes in their songs are the disorientation and confusion of young Moroccans either politically, socially or interpersonally.\n\nA notable duo of Hoba Hoba Spirit was with Moroccan rapper Bigg in a single called \"Goulou Bazz\", which was a huge success. The single is included in the album ''Trabando'' (2007).\n\nSince 2003, the band has emerged as one of the most popular rock acts in Morocco, frequently playing the country's major festivals, such as the [[Mawazine]] Festival in Rabat, L'Boulevard Tremplin in Casablanca, Timitar Festival in Agadir, and the [[Gnaoua World Music Festival|Gnaoua and World Music Festival in Essaouira]].\n\nDuring the 2007 [[Maghreb Music Award]], Hoba Hoba Spirit won three awards in the categories of \"best fusion artist, best album for ''Trabando'', and best title for the song \"Fhamator.\"",
