Born and raised in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], Curry started rapping while in the sixth grade and began working on his first [[mixtape]], ''King Remembered Underground Tape 1991â€“1995'', in 2011, which was influenced by underground Florida rapper [[SpaceGhostPurrp]]. The mixtape was later featured on SpaceGhostPurrp's [[social media]], giving Curry attention in the local music scene and resulting in him joining the former's hip-hop collective [[Raider Klan]].\n\nCurry left Raider Klan in 2013, releasing his debut studio album, ''[[Nostalgic 64]]'', in September of that year, while still in high school. He has since released three [[extended plays]]: ''[[32 Zel/Planet Shrooms]]'' in 2015, [[13 (Denzel Curry EP)|''13'']] in 2017, and [[Unlocked (Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats album)|''Unlocked'']] (a collaboration with [[Kenny Beats]]) in 2020, and four studio albums: ''[[Imperial (Denzel Curry album)|Imperial]]'' in 2016, ''[[Ta13oo]]'' in 2018, ''[[Zuu]]'' in 2019, and ''[[Melt My Eyez See Your Future]]'' in 2022. ''Ta13oo'', ''Zuu'', and ''Melt My Eyez'' debuted at numbers 28, 32, and 51 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, respectively, with ''Melt My Eyez'' returning at number 17 after the release of an extended edition. Two years later, Curry announced ''[[King of the Mischievous South, Vol. 2]]'' which released on July 19, 2024. \n\nReviewers most often praise his aggressive rapping style, energetic performance, lyrical abilities, and artistic versatility. He has been credited as one of the pioneers of the [[SoundCloud rap]] genre.",
