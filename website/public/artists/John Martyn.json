  "description": "'''Iain David McGeachy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE}} (11 September 1948&nbsp;â€“ 29 January 2009), known professionally as '''John Martyn''', was a British singer-songwriter and guitarist. Over a 40-year career, he released 23 studio albums and received frequent critical acclaim. ''[[The Times]]'' described him as \"an electrifying guitarist and singer whose music blurred the boundaries between [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[blues]]\".\n\nMartyn began his career at age 17 as a key member of the Scottish folk music scene, drawing inspiration from American blues and [[Folk music of England|English traditional music]], and signed with [[Island Records]]. By the 1970s he had begun incorporating jazz and rock into his sound on albums such as ''[[Solid Air]]'' (1973) and ''[[One World (John Martyn album)|One World]]'' (1977), as well as experimenting with [[guitar effects]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]] machines like the [[Echoplex]]. Domestic and substance abuse problems marked his personal life throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though he continued to release albums while collaborating with figures such as [[Phil Collins]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]]. He remained active until his death in 2009.",
