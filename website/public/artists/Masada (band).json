  "description": "'''Masada''' is a musical group with rotating personnel led by American saxophonist and composer [[John Zorn]] since the early 1990s.\n\nMasada was the first ensemble to perform Zorn's compositions inspired by Radical Jewish Culture and written to be performed by small groups of musicians. Initially envisioned as a set of 100 \"songs\" notated within a limited number of [[musical staff|staves]] and confined to specific [[musical mode|modes]] or [[musical scale|scales]], Zorn's Masada project would eventually total 613 compositions divided into three specific \"books\".\n\nZorn used [[Hebrew]] titles for these compositions along with melodic themes and musical structures reminiscent of [[klezmer]] music, and [[Jewish]] imagery on album covers to explore Jewish identity within the Masada songbook and groups. He stated: \"The idea with Masada is to produce a sort of radical Jewish music, a new Jewish music which is not the traditional one in a different [[orchestration|arrangement]], but music for the Jews of today. The idea is to put [[Ornette Coleman]] and the Jewish scales together.\"",
