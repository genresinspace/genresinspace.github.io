  "description": "'''NOFX''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|ɛ|f|ˈ|ɛ|k|s}}) was an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1983. Bassist/lead vocalist [[Fat Mike]], rhythm guitarist [[Eric Melvin]] and drummer [[Erik Sandin]] were original founding and longest-serving members of the band, who have appeared on every release by the band, although Sandin departed briefly in 1985, only to rejoin the following year. [[El Hefe]] joined the band in 1991 to play lead guitar and [[trumpet]], rounding out the best-known iteration of the lineup.\n\nNOFX's mainstream success coincided with increased interest in punk rock during the 1990s; unlike many of their contemporaries, however, they had never been signed to a [[major label]]. NOFX released fifteen studio albums, sixteen extended plays and a number of 7\" singles over a career spanning more than four decades. The band rose to popularity with their fifth studio album ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'' (1994), which is their only release to receive a [[Music recording certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Their fifteenth and final studio album, ''[[Double Album (NOFX album)|Double Album]]'', was released on December 2, 2022. The group has sold over eight million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent bands ever. In 2008, NOFX broadcast their own show on [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] entitled ''NOFX: Backstage Passport''. The band retired in October 2024 after a farewell tour.",
