  "description": "'''Michel Joseph Martelly''' ({{IPA|fr|miʃɛl ʒozɛf maʁtɛli}}; born 12 February 1961) is a Haitian musician and politician who served as the 42nd [[president of Haiti]] from May 2011 until February 2016. On August 20, 2024, the United States sanctioned the former president for trafficking drugs, in particular cocaine, into the United States, and for sponsoring several gangs based in Haiti.\n\nMartelly was one of Haiti's best-known musicians for over a decade, going by the [[stage name]] '''Sweet Micky'''. For business and musical reasons, Martelly has moved a number of times between the United States and Haiti. When travelling to the United States, Martelly mostly stays in [[Florida]]. After his presidency, Martelly returned to his former band and sang a carnival [[méringue]] entitled \"Bal Bannann nan\" (Give Her the Banana), as a mocking response to [[Liliane Pierre Paul]], a famous Haitian female journalist in Port-au-Prince.\n\nAs a singer and keyboardist, \"Sweet Micky\" is known for his [[Compas|Kompa]] music, a style of Haitian dance music sung predominantly in the [[Haitian Creole]] language, but he blended this with other styles. Martelly popularized a \"new generation\" of kompas with smaller bands relying on synthesizers and electronic instruments. From 1989 to 2008, Martelly recorded over a dozen studio albums and a number of live CDs. As a musician and club owner in Haiti in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Martelly became associated with the neo-[[François Duvalier|Duvalierist]] [[Defence Force of Haiti|Haitian military]] and police, including figures such as police chief [[Michel François]], and he agreed with the [[1991 Haitian coup d'état]] against [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. In 1995, after Aristide had been restored to office, Martelly's name appeared on a hit list of coup supporters, and he stayed away from Haiti for almost a year. During this time, he released a song, \"Prezidan\" (on the album ''Pa Manyen''), \"an exuberant ditty that called for a president who played compas\". However, he did not run for political office until 2010, when he became a candidate for President of Haiti.\n\nAfter the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|catastrophic earthquake]], Martelly won the [[2010–11 Haitian general election]] for his party [[Repons Peyizan]] (''Farmers' Response Party''), after a run-off against candidate [[Mirlande Manigat]]. Martelly had come in third in the first round of the election, until the [[Organization of American States]] forced [[Jude Célestin]] to withdraw due to alleged fraud. Martelly assumed his position of the [[President of Haiti]] on 14 May 2011 after [[René Préval]] retired to his home in [[Marmelade]]. His election campaign included a promise to reinstate the nation's military, which had been abolished in the 1990s by [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. He resigned as president in February 2016. He was sanctioned by the Canadian government, which accuses him of involvement in human rights violations and supporting criminal gangs, on 17 November 2022. On 20 August 2024, the United States sanctioned the former president for trafficking drugs, including cocaine, destined for the US, and for sponsoring multiple Haiti-based gangs.\n\nFor the political scientist Frédéric Thomas, the accession to power of Michel Martelly in 2011 marked the beginning of a \"form of legal banditry\" and constitutes a key step in the process of decay of the Haitian state.",
