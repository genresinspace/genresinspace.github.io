  "name": "Landser",
  "description": "'''Landser''' ({{IPA|de|ˈlantsɐ|pron|de-Landser.ogg}}) was a German [[Neonazism|neo-Nazi]] rock band. ''Landser'' is an old-fashioned [[German language|German]] [[colloquialism]] for a low-ranking soldier. The band, who is outlawed in Germany, was previously called {{lang|de|italic=no|Endlösung}} ([[Final Solution]]), and was founded by members of the neo-Nazi group {{lang|de|Die Vandalen - Ariogermanische Kampfgemeinschaft}} (The Vandals - Aryan-Germanic Combat Association), which was founded in 1982 in the former [[German Democratic Republic]].\n\nThey performed only one concert that was open to the public, and did so wearing masks. However, they held several private concerts in restaurants in [[Berlin]], Germany. Landser had their CDs manufactured abroad, mainly in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Eastern Europe]]. The music is distributed online, by underground dealers through [[peer-to-peer]] networks or purchased from music labels in the United States and in some European countries where their music is legal (mostly in [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[United Kingdom]]).",
