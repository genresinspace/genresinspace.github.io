  "description": "The '''Tufts Beelzebubs''', frequently referred to as \"'''The Bubs'''\", is a male [[collegiate a cappella|a cappella]] group of students from [[Tufts University]] that performs a mix of pop, rock, [[R&B]], and other types of music while spreading their motto of \"Fun through Song\". Founded in 1962, they have toured in Europe, Asia, South America, and North America, and they competed on NBC's ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' in December 2009, finishing in second place.\n\nThe group is best known for providing song arrangements and background vocals for the fictional all-male a cappella [[glee club]] \"The Dalton Academy Warblers\" on the American TV series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', although the Bubs do not play club members on screen. Singles by the Warblers, with series stars [[Darren Criss]] and [[Chris Colfer]] performing lead vocals, have collectively sold over 2 million copies. Due to their popularity, a full soundtrack album of the Warblers songs was released April 19, 2011 as ''[[Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers]]''.\n\nThe Beelzebubs were the inspiration for the Barden University Treblemakers in the movie franchise ''[[Pitch Perfect (franchise)|Pitch Perfect]]'', being one of the groups covered by Mickey Rapkin in ''Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory'', the book the movies are loosely based on.",
