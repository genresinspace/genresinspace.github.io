  "description": "'''Running Wild''' is a German [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Hamburg]] in 1976. They were part of the [[Music of Germany#Heavy metal|German heavy/power/speed metal scene]] to emerge in the early to mid-1980s and are considered part of the scene's \"big four\" alongside [[Grave Digger (band)|Grave Digger]], [[Helloween]] and [[Rage (German band)|Rage]]. Over the course of their career, they have released 17 studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, and six singles/EPs. \n\nAlthough their earlier releases contained [[Satanism|Satanic]] themes and imagery, from the third album on, the band's primary subject matter was pirates, sailing and other historical events. In 1987, the band released the album ''[[Under Jolly Roger]]'', which was a switch to pirate-based and historical themes, creating and influencing the later named [[pirate metal]] subgenre of heavy metal in the 2000s in the process. While the historical lyrics were superficial at first, the lyrics for later albums were intensively researched, by frontman Rolf Kasparek in particular.\n\nAfter ''Under Jolly Roger'', from 1988 to 1992 (for the albums ''[[Port Royal (album)|Port Royal]]'', ''[[Death or Glory (album)|Death or Glory]]'', ''[[Blazon Stone]]'' and ''[[Pile of Skulls]]''), Running Wild mainly wrote historically based lyrics. In addition to lyrics about pirates, the band also addressed subjects like the [[Wars of the Roses]], the [[Battle of Waterloo]], or the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the New World]] by the Conquistadors.\n\nIn April 2009, Kasparek announced that Running Wild had split up. Their intended last show was at [[Wacken Open Air]] in July that year. It was recorded for CD and DVD release and appeared as ''[[The Final Jolly Roger]]'' in 2011. The split proved temporary as they reunited in 2012. Running Wild played live for the Wacken Open Air festival in 2015. {{As of|2021}}, the band has released 17 studio albums, with their most recent being ''Blood on Blood''.",
