  "description": "'''Crucifix''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], active from 1980 to 1984. They were among the most popular acts of the San Francisco punk scene of the early 1980s.  Fronted by [[Cambodia]]n-born singer Sothira Pheng, Crucifix were distinct among American underground bands for their strong [[D-beat]] musical characteristics and [[anarchist]] lyrical content and graphic design. The band's debut 1983 full-length album ''Dehumanization'' on [[Crass|Crass Records]]‘ offshoot [[Corpus Christi Records]], is  considered by many critics and fans to be a cornerstone of political punk music. After their breakup, Crucifix’s members went on to form the bands Loudspeaker and Proudflesh.",
