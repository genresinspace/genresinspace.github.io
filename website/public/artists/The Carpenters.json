  "description": "The '''Carpenters'''{{efn|Although they are often referred to as \"The Carpenters\", their official name for authorized recordings and press material is simply \"Carpenters\".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=49}}}} were an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of siblings [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] (1950–1983) and [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] (born 1946). They produced a distinctive soft musical style, combining Karen's [[contralto]] vocals with Richard's harmonizing, arranging, and composition. During their 14-year career, the Carpenters recorded 10 albums along with many singles and several television specials.\n\nThe siblings were born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], but moved to [[Downey, California]], in 1963. Richard took piano lessons as a child, progressing to [[California State University, Long Beach]], while Karen learned the drums. They first performed together as a duo in 1965 and formed the [[jazz]]-oriented Richard Carpenter Trio along with Wesley Jacobs, then formed the [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] band Spectrum. Subsequently the two signed as the Carpenters to [[A&M Records]] in 1969; they achieved major success the following year with the hit singles \"[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]\" and \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\". The duo's brand of melodic pop produced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the [[American Top&nbsp;40]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and they became leading sellers in the [[soft rock]], [[easy listening]], and [[adult contemporary music]] genres. They had three number-one singles and five number-two singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot&nbsp;100]] and 15 number-one hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, in addition to 12 top-10 singles.\n\nThe duo toured continually during the 1970s, which put them under increased strain; Richard took a year off in 1979 after he had become addicted to [[Methaqualone|Quaalude]], while Karen suffered from [[anorexia nervosa]]. The duo ended in 1983 when Karen died from heart failure brought on by complications of anorexia. Her death triggered widespread coverage and research into [[eating disorder]]s. Their music continues to attract critical acclaim and commercial success. With more than 100&nbsp;million records sold worldwide, Carpenters are among the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].",
