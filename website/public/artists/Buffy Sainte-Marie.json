She has won recognition, awards, and honors for her music as well as her work in education and social activism. In 1983, her co-written song \"[[Up Where We Belong]]\", for the film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'', won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] at the [[55th Academy Awards]]. The song also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] that same year.\n\nSince the early 1960s, Sainte-Marie claimed [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous Canadian]] ancestry, but a 2023 investigation by [[CBC News]] concluded she was born in the United States and is of Italian and English descent. Some Indigenous musicians and organizations called for awards she won while [[pretendian|falsely claiming an Indigenous identity]] to be rescinded. In 2025, she had many awards and honors revoked, including her membership in the [[Order of Canada]], her induction into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]], her [[Juno Awards]], and her [[Polaris Music Prize|Polaris Music Prizes]].",
