  "name": "Ketama",
  "description": "'''Ketama''' is a Spanish musical group in the [[new flamenco]] tradition. Fusing [[flamenco]] with other musical forms ([[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Brazilian music]], [[reggae]], [[funk]], [[jazz]]), they created a style that lies somewhere between flamenco and [[Pop music|pop]] [[Salsa music|salsa]]. Their music drew as much criticism as praise because purists did not like the change from traditional flamenco, but the group won over the young public. They continued to fuse other music in, and their 2002 album, ''Dame la Mano'', added [[hip hop]] and [[house music]].",
