  "description": "The '''Bad Livers''' were an American band from [[Austin, Texas]] whose inventive musical style defied attempts to categorize them according to existing genres. Their influences included bluegrass, folk, punk, and other musical styles. The original lineup, formed in 1990, included [[Danny Barnes (musician)|Danny Barnes]] on [[banjo]], [[guitar]] and [[resonator guitar]], [[Mark Rubin (musician)|Mark Rubin]] on [[upright bass]] and [[tuba]], and [[Ralph White|Ralph White III]] on [[fiddle]] and [[accordion]]. Barnes composed the majority of the group's original songs. When White left the group at the end of 1996, he was briefly replaced by Bob Grant on [[mandolin]] and guitar. Barnes and Rubin then continued to perform and record as a duo until unofficially dissolving the band in 2000. The band has neither toured nor recorded since then, but Barnes and Rubin have played a few live shows with Grant in 2008, 2009, and 2014.\n\nThe Bad Livers' music has often been cited for its influence on other groups, creating what ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' described as \"an impressive legacy\". ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' credited them with \"revitalizing roots music\", and, according to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', \"The Bad Livers helped open the way for old-time and bluegrass bands of today\".",
