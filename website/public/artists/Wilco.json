  "description": "'''Wilco''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Chicago]]. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of [[alternative country]] group [[Uncle Tupelo]] after singer [[Jay Farrar]]'s departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer [[Jeff Tweedy]] and bassist [[John Stirratt]] remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004 the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist [[Nels Cline]], multi-instrumentalist [[Pat Sansone]], keyboard player [[Mikael Jorgensen]], and drummer [[Glenn Kotche]]. Wilco has released thirteen studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with [[Billy Bragg]] and one with [[the Minus 5]].\n\nWilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles including [[Bill Fay]], [[the Beatles]], and [[Television (band)|Television]]; in turn the band has influenced music by many modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the [[alternative country]] style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]'' (1995), but has since introduced more [[experimental music|experimental]] aspects to their music, including elements of [[alternative rock]] and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \"eclectic [[indie rock]] collective that touches on many eras and genres\".\n\nWilco received media attention for their fourth album, ''[[Yankee Hotel Foxtrot]]'' (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, [[Reprise Records]] rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming ''Foxtrot'' on its website, Wilco sold the album to [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of [[Warner Music Group]], leading a critic to say the album showed \"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\" The event was immortalized in the documentary [[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|''I Am Trying to Break Your Heart'']]; director [[Sam Jones (photographer)|Sam Jones]] followed the band as they wrote and produced the record. ''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two [[Grammy Award]]s for their fifth studio album, 2004's ''[[A Ghost Is Born]]'', including [[Best Alternative Music Album]]. Wilco released their thirteenth studio album, ''[[Cousin (album)|Cousin]]'', in September 2023.",
