In 2008 Campbell and keyboard-player Mickey Virtue left UB40 due to a dispute with band management and teamed up in a new band. In August 2014, Campbell announced he had reunited with former UB40 bandmate Astro, who also left due to management disputes and the musical direction of the band. Campbell then formed a new UB40 featuring the three bandmates.",
