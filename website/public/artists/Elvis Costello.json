  "name": "Elvis Costello",
  "description": "'''Declan Patrick MacManus''' (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as '''Elvis Costello''', is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, author and television host. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Costello \"reinvigorated the literate, lyrical traditions of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]] with the raw energy and sass that were principal ethics of [[punk rock|punk]]\", noting the \"construction of his songs, which set densely layered wordplay in an ever-expanding repertoire of styles\". His first album, ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977), spawned no hit singles, but contains some of Costello's best-known songs, including the ballad \"[[Alison (song)|Alison]]\". Costello's next two albums, ''[[This Year's Model]]'' (1978) and [[Armed Forces (album)|''Armed Forces'']] (1979), recorded with his backing band [[the Attractions]], helped define the [[New wave music|new wave]] genre. From late 1977 until early 1980, each of the eight singles he released reached the UK Top 30. His biggest hit single, \"[[Oliver's Army]]\" (1979), sold more than 500,000 copies in Britain. He has had more modest commercial success in the US, but has earned much critical praise. From 1977 until the early 2000s, Costello's albums regularly ranked high on the ''[[Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll, with ''This Year's Model'' and ''[[Imperial Bedroom]]'' (1982) voted the best album of their respective years.{{efn|Costello's albums have appeared at these ranks on the ''Village Voice'' Pazz & Jop critics' poll: ''My Aim Is True'' (1977), number 2;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=23 January 1978 |title=The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''This Years Model'' (1978), number 1;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=22 January 1979 |title=The 1979 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''Armed Forces'' (1979), number 5;<ref>{{Cite news |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=28 January 1980 |title=The 1977 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll |work=Village Voice}}</ref> ''Get Happy!!''

His opportunity to begin a professional career as a musician coincided with the rise of punk rock in England. The primitivism brought into fashion by punk led Costello to disguise his musical savvy at the beginning of his career, but his stylistic range has come to encompass [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Country music|country]], [[jazz]], [[baroque pop]], [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[classical music]]. He has released album-length collaborations with the classical ensemble the [[Brodsky Quartet]], the [[New Orleans R&B]] songwriter and producer [[Allen Toussaint]] and the hip-hop group [[the Roots]]. Costello has written more than a dozen songs with [[Paul McCartney]] and had a long-running songwriting partnership with [[Burt Bacharach]].\n\nCostello has had hits with [[cover version|covers]] of songs, including [[Sam & Dave]]'s \"[[I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down]]\", [[Jerry Chesnut]]'s \"[[Good Year for the Roses]]\" and [[Charles Aznavour]]'s [[She (Charles Aznavour song)|\"She\"]]. One of the songs he is best known for, \"[[(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding]]\", was written by [[Nick Lowe]] and recorded by Lowe's group [[Brinsley Schwarz]] in 1974, but remained obscure until Costello released his version in 1979. Costello's own songs have been recorded by artists including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[George Jones]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Alison Krauss]].\n\nCostello has won two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] awards, two [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello]] awards, four [[Edison Award|Edison]] awards, an [[MTV Video Music Award]], a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, an [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] Founders award and a [[Gemini Awards|Gemini]] award. In 2003, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2016, he was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. From 2008 to 2010, he hosted a television show, ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'', on which he interviewed other musicians. In 2015, he published a well-received memoir, ''Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink''.",
