  "description": "'''Bikini Kill''' is an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Olympia, Washington]], in October 1990. The group originally consisted of singer and songwriter [[Kathleen Hanna]], guitarist [[Billy Karren]], bassist [[Kathi Wilcox]], and drummer [[Tobi Vail]].\n\nThe band pioneered the [[riot grrrl]] movement, with [[feminist]] lyrics and fiery performances. Their music is characteristically abrasive and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced.\n\nAfter five major releases (two full-length albums, one split album, one EP, and one demo album), they disbanded in 1997. The band reunited briefly in 2017, and then on a more permanent basis in 2019, with various musicians in place of Karren.\n\nIn 2025, Jeff Mezydlo of ''[[Yardbarker]]'' included the band in his list of \"20 underrated bands from the 1990s who are worth rediscovering\".",
