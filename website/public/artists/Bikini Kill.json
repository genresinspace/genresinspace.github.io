The group originally consisted of singer and songwriter [[Kathleen Hanna]], guitarist [[Billy Karren]], bassist [[Kathi Wilcox]], and drummer [[Tobi Vail]].\n\nThe band pioneered the [[riot grrrl]] movement, with [[feminist]] lyrics and fiery performances. Their music is characteristically abrasive and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced.\n\nAfter five major releases (two full-length albums, one split album, one EP, and one demo album), they disbanded in 1997. The band reunited briefly in 2017, and then on a more permanent basis in 2019, with various musicians in place of Karren.",
