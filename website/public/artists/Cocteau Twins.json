  "name": "Cocteau Twins",
  "description": "'''Cocteau Twins''' were a Scottish [[rock music|rock]] band active from 1979 to 1997. They were formed in [[Grangemouth]] on the [[Firth of Forth]] by [[Robin Guthrie]] (guitars, [[drum machine]]) and Will Heggie (bass), adding [[Elizabeth Fraser]] (vocals) in 1981. In 1983, Heggie was replaced by multi-instrumentalist [[Simon Raymonde]]. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, [[Audio signal processing|effects]]-laden sound and the [[soprano]] vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s [[alternative rock|alternative]] subgenre of [[dream pop]] and helped define what would become [[shoegaze]].\n\nIn 1982, the band signed with the record label [[4AD]] and released their debut album, ''[[Garlands (album)|Garlands]]''. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their best-known lineup, which soon produced the No. 29 UK single \"[[Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops]]\", their highest-charting UK single. The trio crystallised their \"swelling, euphoric\" dream pop style on the 1984 album ''[[Treasure (Cocteau Twins album)|Treasure]]'', which became the band's first UK Top 40 album. In April 1986, they released their fourth album, ''[[Victorialand]]'', becoming their first top ten album in the United Kingdom, and in November 1986 released ''[[The Moon and the Melodies]]'', a collaborative album with American composer [[Harold Budd]]. \n\nThe group's fifth album ''[[Blue Bell Knoll]]'' (1988) peaked at number 15 in the UK and at 109 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the US: \"[[Carolyn's Fingers]]\" was popular on US alternative radio stations and reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. Their sixth album, ''[[Heaven or Las Vegas]]'' (1990) became their most commercially successful album in the UK, reaching number 7 on the albums chart.\n\nBy 1993, the band had left 4AD for [[Fontana Records]], and released their seventh album ''[[Four-Calendar Café]]'' (1993). Following its release they made their debut American television appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' performing the single \"[[Bluebeard (song)|Bluebeard]]\". ''Four-Calendar Café'' became their highest charting album on the ''Billboard'' 200 in the United States, reaching number 78. They released their eighth and final album ''[[Milk & Kisses]]'' in April 1996, supported by two singles – \"[[Tishbite (song)|Tishbite]]\" and \"[[Violaine]]\". After nearly 20 years together, the group disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser's and Guthrie's romantic relationship.",
