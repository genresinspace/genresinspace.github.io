  "description": "'''Sly and the Family Stone''' was an American band formed in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]], in 1966 and active until 1983. Their work, which blended elements of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[R&B]], became a pivotal influence on subsequent [[American popular music]]. Their core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist [[Sly Stone]], and included Stone's siblings [[Freddie Stone]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Rose Stone]] (keyboard, vocals) alongside [[Cynthia Robinson]] (trumpet, vocals), [[Greg Errico]] (drums), [[Jerry Martini]] (saxophone), and [[Larry Graham]] (bass, vocals). The band was the first major American rock group to have a [[Racial integration|racially integrated]], mixed-gender lineup.\n\nFormed in 1966, the group synthesized a variety of musical genres to pioneer the emerging \"[[psychedelic soul]]\" sound. They released a series of Top 10 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits such as \"[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]\" (1968), \"[[Everyday People]]\" (1968), “[[Hot Fun in the Summertime]]” (1969), and \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as ''[[Stand!]]'' (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary. In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' (1971) and ''[[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|Fresh]]'' (1973), proving as influential as their early work. By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution, though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name \"Sly and the Family Stone\" until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987.\n\nThe work of Sly and the Family Stone influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul, [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[hip hop music]]. Music critic [[Joel Selvin]] wrote, \"there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone\". In 2010, they were ranked 43rd in [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]], and three of their albums are included on the most recent version of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993.",
