[[Pitchfork Media]] reviewed one of their previous albums, ''[[Songs of Shame]]'', giving the band its \"Best New Music\" designation and describing the sound as \"a distinctive blend of spooky campfire folk, lo-fi rock, homemade tape collages, and other noisy interludes, all anchored by deceptively sturdy melodies.\"\n\nSinger-guitarist and founder Jeremy Earl also runs the Brooklyn label [[Woodsist]], for whom the band releases their work.",
