Though primarily a guitarist, Oldfield played a range of instruments, which included keyboards and percussion, as well as vocals. He had adopted a range of musical styles throughout his career, including [[progressive rock]], [[World music|world]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[new age music]].\n\nOldfield took up the guitar at age ten and left school in his teens to embark on a music career. From 1967 to 1970, he and his sister [[Sally Oldfield]] were a folk duo, [[the Sallyangie]], after which he performed with [[Kevin Ayers]]. In 1971, Oldfield started work on ''Tubular Bells'' which caught the attention of [[Richard Branson]], who agreed to release it on his new label, [[Virgin Records]]. Its opening was used in the horror film ''[[The Exorcist]]'' and the album went on to sell over 2.7 million copies in the UK. Oldfield followed it with ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975) and ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' (1978), all of which feature longform and mostly instrumental pieces.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Oldfield began to tour and release more commercial and song-based music, beginning with ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'' (1979), ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'' (1980) and ''[[Five Miles Out]]'' (1982). His most successful album of this period was ''[[Crises (Mike Oldfield album)|Crises]]'' (1983), which features the worldwide hit single \"[[Moonlight Shadow]]\" with vocalist [[Maggie Reilly]]. After signing with [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in the early 1990s, Oldfield's most significant album of the decade was ''[[Tubular Bells II]]'' (1992) and he experimented with virtual reality and gaming content with his [[MusicVR]] project. In 2012, he performed at the opening ceremony for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] held in London. [[Mike Oldfield discography|Oldfield's discography]] includes 26 studio albums, nine of which have reached the UK top ten. His final album, ''[[Return to Ommadawn]],'' was released in 2017.
