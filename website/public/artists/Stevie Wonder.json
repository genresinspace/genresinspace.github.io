  "description": "'''Stevland Hardaway Morris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|iː|v|l|ə|n|d}} {{respell|STEEV|lənd}}; {{né|'''Judkins'''}}; born May 13, 1950), known professionally as '''Stevie Wonder''', is an American singer-songwriter, musician, and record producer. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, and is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], pop, [[Soul music|soul]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[funk]], and [[jazz]]. A virtual [[one-man band]] during much of his peak years, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other [[electronic musical instrument]]s in the 1970s reshaped the conventions of [[contemporary R&B]]. He also helped drive such genres into the [[album era]], crafting his [[LP record|LPs]] as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions.\n\nBlind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a [[child prodigy]] who signed with [[Motown]]'s [[Tamla]] label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name '''Little Stevie Wonder'''. As a teenager he established himself as one of Motown's most successful acts, becoming known for his high-pitched singing and excited [[harmonica]] playing. His single \"[[Fingertips]]\" was a No. 1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1963, when he was 13, making him the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Age records|youngest solo artist ever]] to top the chart. His other 1960s hits include \"[[Uptight (Everything's Alright)]]\", \"[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]\", \"[[For Once in My Life#Stevie Wonder version|For Once in My Life]]\", and \"[[My Cherie Amour (song)|My Cherie Amour]]\". Wonder's critical and commercial peak—termed his \"classic period\"—came in the 1970s with five albums released in the span of four-and-a-half years, beginning in 1972 with the albums ''[[Music of My Mind]]'' and ''[[Talking Book]]'', which abandoned the [[Motown sound]] in favor of a synthesizer- and keyboard-driven one. He was the first Black musician to win the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases, with ''[[Innervisions]]'' (1973), ''[[Fulfillingness' First Finale]]'' (1974), and ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' (1976). During that decade, he scored the US number-one singles \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\", \"[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]\", \"[[You Haven't Done Nothin']]\", \"[[I Wish (Stevie Wonder song)|I Wish]]\" and \"[[Sir Duke]]\".\n\nIn the 1980s Wonder achieved international cultural presence, with high-profile collaborations (notably with [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Michael Jackson]]), television appearances, charity work, and political influence, including his 1980 campaign to make [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s birthday [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day|a federal holiday]] in the United States. ''[[Hotter Than July]]'' (1980), the soundtrack album ''[[The Woman in Red (soundtrack)|The Woman in Red]]'' (1984), and ''[[In Square Circle]]'' (1985) all peaked within the top five of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. \"[[Ebony and Ivory]]\", \"[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]\", \"[[Part-Time Lover]]\" and \"[[That's What Friends Are For#Dionne Warwick version|That's What Friends Are For]]\" all reached number-one, making him the first act to top the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in three consecutive decades. Wonder returned to the top five with his latest album, ''[[A Time to Love (album)|A Time to Love]]'' (2005), and he has continued to remain active in music and political causes.\n\nWonder is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], with sales of more than 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 [[Grammy Awards]] (the most by a male solo artist) and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. He has been inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. He ranked in the top 10 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} lists of the [[Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|greatest singers]] and [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|greatest songwriters]] of all time. In 2009, Wonder was named a [[United Nations Messengers of Peace|United Nations Messenger of Peace]], and in 2014, he was honored with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]. Believing himself to be of Ghanaian ancestry, he was conferred Ghanaian citizenship in 2024.",
