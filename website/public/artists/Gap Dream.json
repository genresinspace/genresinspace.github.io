  "name": "Gap Dream",
  "description": "'''Gap Dream''' is an American psychedelic [[synthpop]] band founded by Gabe Fulvimar in 2012 in [[Fullerton, California]]. As the band’s singer, songwriter and instrumentalist, Fulvimar is the only regular member of Gap Dream and solely responsible for its musical direction. In live performances, Fulvimar is accompanied by guitarist Corey Lanigan, and bassist Bobby May.\n\nGap Dream’s sound owes its origins to Fulvimar’s love of 60s psychedelic pop combined with his interest in vintage [[synthesizer]] sounds. Born in [[Akron]], Ohio, he grew up listening to [[Sonic Youth]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and was in an early version of [[The Black Keys]].\n\nIn 2010, Fulvimar met [[Burger Records]] cofounder Lee Rickard during a Burgermania artist tour, which had stopped in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, Fulvimar’s home at the time. Inspired by the Burger artists performing that day, he kept in touch with the Burger team, eventually sending them a sampling of self-recorded demos. Impressed, Burger released Gap Dream’s self-titled album on cassette in January 2012, followed by the January 2013 release ''Shine Your Light'', a project on which he collaborated with Conspiracy of Owls guitarist/vocalist Bobby Harlow.\nIn December 2013, Fulmiver’s Gap Dream project covered [[The Velvet Underground]]'s \"[[Sister Ray]]\", [[Lou Reed]]'s 17-minute ode to the gritty underside of New York City, on Burger Records' ''White Light/White Heat'' tribute.\n\nIn July 2020, Gap Dream was included in accusations of sexual assault surrounding Burger Records, which led to the collapse of the Burger Records label and store.",
