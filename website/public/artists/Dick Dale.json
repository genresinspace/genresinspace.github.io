  "description": "'''Richard Anthony Monsour''' (May 4, 1937 – March 16, 2019), known professionally as '''Dick Dale''', was an American [[Rock music|rock]] guitarist. He was a pioneer of [[surf music]], drawing on [[Middle Eastern music]] [[scale (music)|scales]] and experimenting with [[reverb effect|reverb]]. Dale was known as \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The King of the Surf Guitar]],\" which was also the title of [[King of the Surf Guitar|his second studio album]].\n\nDale was one of the most influential guitarists of all time and especially of the early 1960s. Most of the leading bands in surf music, such as [[the Beach Boys]], [[Jan and Dean]] and [[the Trashmen]], were influenced by Dale's music, and often included recordings of Dale's songs in their albums. His style and music influenced guitarists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pete Townshend]], [[Eddie Van Halen]] and [[Brian May]].\n\nHe has been credited with popularizing [[Alternate picking|tremolo picking]] on electric guitar, a technique that is now widely used in many musical genres (such as [[extreme metal]], [[jazz fusion]], etc.). His speedy single-note staccato picking technique was unrivaled until guitarists like Eddie Van Halen entered the music scene.\n\nHe is cited as one of the fathers of heavy metal for pushing the limits of amplification. Working together with [[Leo Fender]], Dale helped to develop new equipment that was capable of producing thick and previously unheard volumes including the first-ever 100-watt [[guitar amplifier]]. Dale also pioneered the use of portable reverb effects.\n\nThe use of his recording of \"[[Misirlou]]\" by [[Quentin Tarantino]] in the film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' led to his return in the 1990s, marked by four albums and world tours. He was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category for the song \"[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]\" with [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. In \"''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,\" Dale was ranked 31st in 2003 and 74th in the 2011 revision.\n\n__TOC__",
