  "name": "Steve Taylor",
  "description": "'''Roland Stephen Taylor''' (born December 9, 1957) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, music executive, film maker, assistant professor, and actor. A figure in what has come to be known as [[Christian alternative rock]], Taylor enjoyed a successful solo career during the 1980s, and also served in the short-lived group [[Chagall Guevara]]. In contrast to many Christian musical artists, his songs have often taken aim at Christian hypocrisy or \"error\" with the use of satirical, sardonic lyrics. In 1997, he founded the record label [[Squint Entertainment]], which fueled the careers of artists such as [[Sixpence None the Richer]], [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle]], and [[Burlap to Cashmere]]. Despite this success, Taylor was ousted from the label by its parent, [[Word Entertainment]], in 2001. He has produced and written for numerous musical acts, one of the most consistent being [[Newsboys]]. As a film-maker, Taylor co-wrote, directed, and produced the feature films ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'', ''[[The Second Chance]]'', and ''[[Blue Like Jazz (film)|Blue Like Jazz]]''. After a decade and a half of hiatus, Taylor returned to performing music in 2010 as the front-man for [[Steve Taylor & The Perfect Foil]], a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] he founded with [[Peter Furler]], [[Jimmy Abegg]], and [[John Mark Painter]]. Along with a university residency and continued filmmaking, Taylor would resume work on unfinished [[Chagall Guevara]] material into the 2020s.",
