Their fifth album ''A Door Left Open'' is set for release on June 6, 2025.\n\nThe band's sonic style is described by Adam Easterling as \"big pants music\", blending traditional metallic hardcore with the aggressive [[groove metal]] aggression of bands such as [[Meshuggah]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and the [[nu metal]] bounce of bands such as [[Korn]] and [[System of a Down]], creating a brand of [[nu metalcore]]",
