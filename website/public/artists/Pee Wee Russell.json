  "description": "'''Charles Ellsworth \"Pee Wee\" Russell''' (March 27, 1906 â€“ February 15, 1969) was an American [[jazz]] musician. Early in his career he played [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]]s, but he eventually focused solely on clarinet.\n\nWith a highly individualistic and spontaneous clarinet style that \"defied classification\", Russell began his career playing [[traditional jazz]], but throughout his career incorporated elements of newer developments such as [[Swing music|swing]], [[bebop]], and [[free jazz]]. Writing in 1961, the poet [[Philip Larkin]] commented: \"No one familiar with the characteristic excitement of his solos, their lurid, snuffling, asthmatic voicelessness, notes leant on till they split, and sudden passionate intensities, could deny the uniqueness of his contribution to jazz.\"",
