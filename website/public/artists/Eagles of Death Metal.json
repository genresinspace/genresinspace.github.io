Founded by [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Josh Homme]] (drums), the band also includes a wide range of other musicians who perform both on the band's studio albums and at live shows. Hughes and Homme are the only permanent members of the band, with Homme rarely performing at live shows due to commitment to his other band, [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. The band's current touring lineup includes Hughes alongside Leah Bluestein (drums), [[Scott Shiflett]] (guitar), [[Jennie Vee]] (bass) and Rex Roulette (guitar).\n\nDespite their name, Eagles of Death Metal are not a [[death metal]] band, and the name is intended to be humorous. In a 2003 interview, Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"[[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[slide guitar]] mixed with stripper drum beats and [[Canned Heat]] vocals.\" Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances.",
