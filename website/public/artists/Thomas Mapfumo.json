  "description": "'''Thomas Tafirenyika Mapfumo''' (born July 3, 1945) is a Zimbabwean musician. He is nicknamed \"The Lion of [[Zimbabwe]]\" and \"Mukanya\" (the praise name of his clan in the Shona language) for his immense popularity and for the political influence he wields through his music, including his sharp criticism of the government of former Zimbabwean president [[Robert Mugabe]]. He both created and popularized [[Chimurenga music]], and is known for his distinctive voice and slow-moving style.\n\nMapfumo was imprisoned without charges under the white-dominated regime of [[Rhodesia]], and he was hounded by the Mugabe government of [[Zimbabwe]] that succeeded it. He lived in [[exile]] in the United States for two decades, and in April 2018, returned to [[Zimbabwe]] for the first time since 2005 to perform a concert.",
