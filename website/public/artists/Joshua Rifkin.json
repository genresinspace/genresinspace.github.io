Rifkin argued that \"so long as we define 'chorus' in the conventional modern sense, then Bach's chorus with few exceptions simply did not exist.\"\n\nHe is best known among the public for helping to revive [[ragtime]] in the 1970s by recording three albums of [[Scott Joplin]]'s works for [[Nonesuch Records]].",
