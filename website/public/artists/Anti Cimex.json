  "description": "'''Anti Cimex''' (also '''Anti-Cimex''') was a Swedish [[crust punk]] band formed in 1981 and based in [[Skövde]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Linköping]] and [[Malmö]] at different times. They were one of the first bands to define Scandinavian [[hardcore punk]]. Their second 7-inch is considered to be a subgenre-defining [[D-beat]] record. Scene historian Peter Jandreus described the group as the most famous Swedish punk band of the 1977–1987 era.\n\nTheir name is taken from the Swedish [[pest control]] company with the same name, [[Anticimex]], the name of this company, in turn, comes from the [[Latin]] name of a particular type of [[bed bug]]; ''[[Cimex]]''.",
