  "description": "'''Peter, Paul and Mary''' were an American [[Contemporary folk music|folk]] group formed in New York City in 1961 during the [[American folk music revival]]. The trio consisted of [[Peter Yarrow]] (guitar, [[tenor]] vocals), [[Paul Stookey]] (guitar, [[baritone]] vocals), and [[Mary Travers]] ([[contralto]] vocals).  The group's repertoire included songs written by Yarrow, Luis Manuel and Stookey, early songs by [[Bob Dylan]], and covers of other folk musicians.\n\nThey were very successful in the early- and mid-1960s, with their debut album topping the charts for weeks, and helped popularize the folk music revival. Following Travers's death in 2009, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform as a duo. Yarrow died in 2025, leaving Stookey the sole surviving member of the group.\n\nTravers said she was influenced by [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Pete Seeger]], and [[the Weavers]].  In May 1963, Stookey described the formation and dynamics of the group on Folk Music Worldwide, an international short-wave radio show in New York City. In the 2004 documentary ''Peter, Paul & Mary: Carry It On â€“ A Musical Legacy'', members of the Weavers discuss how Peter, Paul and Mary took over the torch of the social commentary of folk music in the 1960s.\n\nThe group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1999. Peter, Paul and Mary received the [[Sammy Cahn]] Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2006.",
