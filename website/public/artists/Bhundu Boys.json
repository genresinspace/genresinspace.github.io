  "description": "The '''Bhundu Boys''' were a Zimbabwean [[musical ensemble|band]] that played a mixture of [[chimurenga music]] with American [[rock and roll]], [[disco]], [[country music|country]], and [[pop music|pop]] influences.  Their style became known as [[jit]], and is quite popular across Africa, with some international success, and has influenced later groups like Nehoreka and Mokoomba. British world music DJ [[Andy Kershaw]] said that at the height of their magical powers they were \"...the single most natural, effortless, catchy pop band I've ever heard\"; the BBC's [[John Peel]] famously broke down in tears the first time he saw the band perform live.\n\nThe name came from bhundu (meaning \"bush\" or \"jungle\"), in reference to the young boys who used to aid the nationalist guerrilla fighters in the [[Rhodesian Bush War|1970s war]] against the white minority government of what was then [[Rhodesia]]. Lead singer Biggie Tembo (Biggie Rodwell Tembo Marasha) was a Bhundu boy.",
