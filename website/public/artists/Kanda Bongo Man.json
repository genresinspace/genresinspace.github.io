  "description": "'''Bongo Kanda''' (born 1 January 1955), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Kanda Bongo Man''', is a Congolese [[soukous]] musician and singer. His career debuted in 1973 when he became the singer for the Belle Mambo band, developing a sound influenced by [[Tabu Ley Rochereau|Tabu Ley]]. His solo career only started to take off after he moved to Paris in 1979, where his music started to incorporate elements of then-vibrant [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]] music popularized by [[Kassav]] (originating in the [[French West Indies]]). His first solo albums, ''Iyole'' in 1981 and ''Djessy'' in 1982, were hits.\n\nHe is known for the structural changes he implemented to soukous [[music]]. The previous approach was to sing several verses and have one [[guitar solo]] at the end of the song. Kanda Bongo Man revolutionized soukous by encouraging guitar solos after every verse and even sometimes at the beginning of the song. His form of soukous gave birth to the [[kwassa kwassa]] dance rhythm where the hips move back and forth while the hands move to follow the hips.\n\nLike many African rumba and soukous musicians before him, Kanda Bongo Man also had an entourage of musicians. Many of Kanda's musicians later moved on to start their own solo careers. Most notable of these was [[Diblo Dibala]]. Known as \"Machine Gun,\" Diblo Dibala was a vital part of Kanda Bongo Man's lineup on several albums, playing guitar on both ''Kwasa Kwasa'' and ''Amour Fou''.\n\nKanda Bongo Man still tours in Europe and the [[United States]]. In July 2005, he performed at the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|LIVE 8: Africa Calling]] concert in [[Cornwall]]. He has performed several times at the [[Africa Oyé]] Festival in [[Liverpool]], most recently in June 2022.",
