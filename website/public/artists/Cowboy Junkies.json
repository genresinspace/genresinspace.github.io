  "description": "'''Cowboy Junkies''' are an [[alternative country]] and [[folk rock]] band formed in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada in 1985 by Alan Anton (bassist), Michael Timmins (songwriter, guitarist), Peter Timmins (drummer) and [[Margo Timmins]] (vocalist). The three Timminses are siblings, and Anton worked with Michael Timmins during their first couple of bands. John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album. The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.\n\nCowboy Junkies' 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.\n\nThe band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again with [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988. \n\nCowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2025.",
