  "description": "'''Felix Clary Weatherall''' (born June 1993), known by his stage name '''Ross from Friends''', is a British [[electronic music]] producer and [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. He is signed to the [[Brainfeeder]] label, and released his debut album ''[[Family Portrait (album)|Family Portrait]]'' in July 2018, being noted as \"one to watch\" by ''[[The Guardian]]''.\n\nWeatherall began to make music under a number of different names before settling on Ross from Friends in 2012. The name was chosen because a TV in the studio he was using had a DVD of ''[[Friends]]'' stuck inside it, and so would only play episodes of ''Friends''.",
