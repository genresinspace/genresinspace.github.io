His [[orchestra]] did well commercially.\n\nFrom 1936 until the mid-1940s, Goodman led one of the most popular [[Swing music|swing]] [[big bands]] in the United States. His [[The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert|concert at Carnegie Hall]] in New York City on January 16, 1938, is described by critic Bruce Eder as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\"\n\nGoodman's bands started the careers of many jazz musicians. During an era of racial segregation, he led one of the first integrated jazz groups, his trio and quartet. He continued performing until the end of his life while pursuing an interest in classical music.",
