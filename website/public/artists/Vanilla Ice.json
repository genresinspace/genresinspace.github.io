  "description": "'''Robert Matthew Van Winkle''' (born October 31, 1967), known professionally as '''Vanilla Ice''', is an American rapper, actor, and television host. Born in [[Dallas]] and raised in [[Miami]], he was the first solo [[White Americans|white]] rapper to achieve commercial success following the 1990 release of his best-known hit \"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\". He is credited with breaking down racial barriers in rap and hip-hop for future white rappers, most notably [[Eminem]].\n\nIce released his debut album, ''Hooked'', on the independent [[Ichiban Records]] before signing a contract with [[SBK Records]], a record label of the [[EMI Group]], which released a reformatted version under the title ''[[To the Extreme]]''; it became the fastest-selling [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album of all time and \"Ice Ice Baby\" was the first hip hop single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|charts]]. Followed by the live album ''[[Extremely Live]]'' (1991), Ice made a cameo appearance on the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) where he performed \"[[Ninja Rap]]\", which he co-wrote. He was soon offered and starred in his own film, ''[[Cool as Ice]]'' (1991), which included the single \"[[Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)]]\" with [[Naomi Campbell]]; the film itself was a box office failure.\n\nHis fast rise in popularity was quickly marred by media controversies about his background, and criticism about his appeal of hip hop to a mainstream audience alongside [[MC Hammer]]. Ice later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, who had also published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. Ice's second studio album, ''[[Mind Blowin']]'' (1994), featured a major image change but was commercially unsuccessful. Following [[rap rock]] performances in the underground scene and playing in a local [[grunge]] band, Ice released the dark [[nu metal]] album ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'' (1998), followed by the independently released ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'' (2001) and ''[[Platinum Underground]]'' (2005).\n\nIn the 2000s, Ice began appearing on television [[reality shows]] including ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. In 2010, Ice began hosting ''[[The Vanilla Ice Project]]'' on [[DIY Network]] which ran for nine seasons until 2019. In 2022, he started another home improvement television program, ''The Vanilla Ice Home Show''. He is also involved in [[motocross]] racing and real estate.",
