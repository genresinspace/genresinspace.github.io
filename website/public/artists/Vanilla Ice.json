  "description": "'''Robert Matthew Van Winkle''' (born October 31, 1967), known professionally as '''Vanilla Ice''', is an American rapper, actor, and television host. Born in [[Dallas]] and raised in [[Miami]], he was the first solo [[White Americans|white]] rapper to achieve commercial success, following the 1990 release of his best-known hit \"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\". He is credited with breaking down racial barriers in rap and hip-hop for future white rappers, most notably [[Eminem]].\n\nIce released his debut album, ''Hooked'', on the independent [[Ichiban Records]] before signing a contract with [[SBK Records]], a record label of the [[EMI Group]], which released a reformatted version under the title ''[[To the Extreme]]''; it became the fastest-selling [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] album of all time and \"Ice Ice Baby\" was the first hip hop single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|charts]]. Followed by the live album ''[[Extremely Live]]'' (1991), Ice made a cameo appearance on the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) where he performed \"[[Ninja Rap]]\", which he co-wrote. He was soon offered and starred in his own film, ''[[Cool as Ice]]'' (1991), which included the single \"[[Cool as Ice (Everybody Get Loose)]]\" with [[Naomi Campbell]]; the film itself was a box office failure.\n\nHis fast rise in popularity was quickly marred by media controversies about his background. Ice later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, who had also published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. Ice's second studio album, ''[[Mind Blowin']]'' (1994), featured a major image change but was commercially unsuccessful. Following [[rap rock]] performances in the underground scene and playing in a local [[grunge]] band, Ice released the dark [[nu metal]] album ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'' (1998), followed by the independently released ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'' (2001) and ''[[Platinum Underground]]'' (2005).\n\nIn the 2000s, Ice began appearing on television [[reality shows]] including ''[[The Surreal Life]]''. In 2010, Ice began hosting ''[[The Vanilla Ice Project]]'' on [[DIY Network]] which ran for nine seasons until 2019. In 2022, he started another home improvement television program, ''The Vanilla Ice Home Show''. He is also involved in [[motocross]] racing and real estate.",
