  "description": "'''Roxette''' is a Swedish [[pop rock]] duo originally consisting of [[Marie Fredriksson]] and [[Per Gessle]], both of whom were already established musicians in Sweden prior to the band's formation. Fredriksson had released a number of successful solo albums, while Gessle had been the lead singer and songwriter of [[Gyllene Tider]], a band which had three number one albums in Sweden. Acting on the advice of Rolf Nygren, the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of their mutual record label [[EMI]], Fredriksson and Gessle collaborated to record \"[[Neverending Love]]\", the first single from Roxette's 1986 debut album ''[[Pearls of Passion]]'', which were both hits in Sweden. \n\nTheir international breakthrough came with the release of ''[[Look Sharp! (Roxette album)|Look Sharp!]]'' in 1988. The album contained two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number ones: \"[[The Look]]\" and \"[[Listen to Your Heart (Roxette song)|Listen to Your Heart]]\". \"[[It Must Have Been Love]]\", from the [[Pretty Woman (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 1990 film ''[[Pretty Woman]]'', reached number one as well, as did the [[Joyride (Roxette song)|lead single]] of their third studio album, 1991's ''[[Joyride (Roxette album)|Joyride]]''. That album is Roxette's most successful, selling eleven million copies worldwide. They performed to over 1.5 million people during the \"[[Join the Joyride! Tour]]\". Subsequent albums included 1992's ''[[Tourism (Roxette album)|Tourism]]'', 1994's ''[[Crash! Boom! Bang!]]'', and 1995's greatest hits compilation ''[[Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!]]'', which each sold at least five million copies worldwide.\n\n''[[Have a Nice Day (Roxette album)|Have a Nice Day]]'' and ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' were released in 1999 and 2001, respectively, and earned numerous gold and platinum awards in Europe and [[Latin America]]. Fredriksson was diagnosed with a [[brain tumour]] in 2002, leading to an extended hiatus. The two then released several solo albums, with Gessle also reuniting with Gyllene Tider. Roxette reformed in 2009 for an [[The Neverending World Tour|extensive world tour]], which ran until 2016. During this period, they released the albums ''[[Charm School (Roxette album)|Charm School]]'', ''[[Travelling (Roxette album)|Travelling]]'', and ''[[Good Karma]]''. Fredriksson announced her retirement from touring in 2016 due to poor health, and died on 9 December 2019 due to complications stemming from her brain tumour diagnosis.\n\nRoxette is Sweden's second-best-selling music act, after [[ABBA]]. They sold between 75 and 80 million records worldwide, and are recognised as one of the [[List of highest-certified music artists in Germany|highest-certified acts of all time]] in Germany, achieving sales of almost six million units. They had nineteen top 40 hits in the United Kingdom, where the [[British Phonographic Industry]] awarded them certifications of over three million units. In the US, they achieved four number ones on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and have been certified for sales of over three million units by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Since 2021, Gessle has released music under the name [[PG Roxette]]; their debut album ''[[Pop-Up Dynamo!]]'' was issued in 2022. In 2024, he announced a Roxette tour, with [[Lena Philipsson]] hired as vocalist.",
