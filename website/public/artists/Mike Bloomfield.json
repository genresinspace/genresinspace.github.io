  "description": "'''Michael Bernard Bloomfield''' (July 28, 1943 â€“ February 15, 1981) was an American [[blues]] guitarist and composer.

In 1965, he played on [[Bob Dylan|Bob Dylan's]] ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'', including the single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\", and [[Electric Dylan controversy|performed with Dylan]] at that year's [[Newport Folk Festival]].\n\nBloomfield was ranked No. 22 on [[Rolling Stone]]'s list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011.
