The band released three albums: ''[[Aquarium (Aqua album)|Aquarium]]'' in 1997, ''[[Aquarius (Aqua album)|Aquarius]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Megalomania (Aqua album)|Megalomania]]'' in 2011. The group sold an estimated 33 million albums and singles, making them the most profitable Danish band ever.\n\nThe group managed to top the [[UK Singles Chart]] with three of their singles. The group also caused controversy with the [[double entendre]]s in their \"[[Barbie Girl]]\" single, with [[Mattel]] [[Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.|filing a lawsuit against the group]]. The lawsuit was finally dismissed by a judge in 2002, who ruled \"The parties are advised to chill\".\n\nThe band's members are vocalists [[René Dif]] and [[Lene Nystrøm]], keyboardist [[Søren Rasted]], and guitarist [[Claus Norreen]]. During their split, Nystrøm, Dif and Rasted all achieved solo chart success, while Norreen [[remix]]ed other artists' material. At a press event on October 26, 2007, the group announced a reunion tour, as well as the release of a [[Greatest Hits (Aqua album)|compilation album]] featuring new material.
