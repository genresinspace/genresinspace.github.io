  "name": "Gene Krupa",
  "description": "'''Eugene Bertram Krupa''' (January 15, 1909 â€“ October 16, 1973) was an American [[jazz drummer]], bandleader, and composer. Krupa is widely regarded as one of the most influential drummers in the history of popular music. His drum solo on [[Benny Goodman]]'s 1937 recording of \"[[Sing, Sing, Sing]]\" elevated the role of the drummer from that of an accompanist to that of an important solo voice in the band.\n\nIn collaboration with the [[Slingerland]] drum- and [[Zildjian]] cymbal-manufacturers, he became a major force in defining the standard band-drummer's kit. ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazine regards Krupa as \"the founding father of modern drumset playing\".\n\nUpon his death, ''[[The New York Times]]'' labeled Krupa a \"revolutionary\" known for \"frenzied, flashy\" drumming, with his work having generated a significant musical legacy that started \"in jazz and has continued on through the rock era\".",
