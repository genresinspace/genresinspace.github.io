The band has released four studio albums to date.\n\nThe band members play under the use of nicknames, and wear costumes on stage that mirror the band's lyrical themes. The group describes themselves as \"adventure metal,\" in part due to the use of costumes, props, and demeanor onstage. The band has cited early [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]] like ''[[Heroes of Might & Magic]]'' and [[table-top role-playing games]] like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' as inspiration for their appearance.",
