Following the release of their debut studio album, ''[[Funky Town (Camp Mulla album)|Funky Town]]'', the group's lead singer Karun and rapper Taio both left the group to pursue higher education and solo careers. In September 2017 the main four members announced their reunion at The Wave performance at the Waterfront, Ng'ong racecourse, but soon after disbanded again.
