  "description": "The {{Nihongo|'''Military-First Girls'''|先軍女子|Sengun Joshi|extra=from the [[Korean language|Korean]] term ''[[Songun]]''|lead=yes}} are a Japanese all-women [[fan club]] of the [[Moranbong Band]], a North Korean [[girl group]]. The club has held live performances where members dance to [[North Korean pop]] songs, following the [[choreography]] of the Moranbong Band. The club's founder and leader is Chunhun, a Japanese illustrator who became interested in [[North Korean culture]] after coming across [[North Korean propaganda]] art during her university studies.\n\nChunhun has stated that her goal is to introduce North Korean culture to the Japanese public and normalize their perceptions of the country. She has compared her club's interest in North Korean music to other Japanese women's interest in [[K-pop]] and American singer [[Taylor Swift]]. Club members have received backlash from [[Uyoku dantai|Japanese nationalists and right-wingers]] due to their perceived sympathies towards North Korea.",
