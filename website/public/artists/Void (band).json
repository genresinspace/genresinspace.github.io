  "description": "'''Void''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band formed in [[Columbia, Maryland]], in 1980. The group was a pioneering force in the thriving [[Washington, D.C., hardcore]] scene during the early 1980s, successfully combining elements of [[punk rock|punk]] with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] in a style that was accepted by the scene's otherwise exclusive community. Void's punk metal fusion sound was marked by guitarist Bubba Dupree's innovative guitar work and the \"unhinged\" vocals of John Weiffenbach, which resonated in the band's chaotic but popular live performances. Like many of their contemporaries, Void had a short-lived recording career, limited to the split album ''[[Faith/Void Split]]'' with [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]], and three tracks on the ''[[Flex Your Head]]'' compilation LP, both released by [[Dischord Records]]. However, they have enjoyed an enduring cult following among hardcore aficionados.",
