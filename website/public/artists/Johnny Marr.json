  "description": "'''John Martin Marr''' ([[Birth name#Maiden and married names|n√©]] '''Maher'''; born 31 October 1963) is a musician, songwriter and singer. He first achieved fame as the guitarist and co-songwriter of [[the Smiths]], who were active from 1982 to 1987. He has since performed with numerous other bands and embarked on a solo career.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Manchester]], England, Marr formed his first band at the age of 13. He was part of several bands with [[Andy Rourke]] before forming the Smiths with [[Morrissey]] in 1982. The Smiths attained commercial success and were critically acclaimed, with Marr's [[jangle pop]] guitar style becoming a distinctive part of the band's sound, but separated in 1987 due to personal differences between Marr and Morrissey. Since then, Marr has been a member of [[the Pretenders]], [[the The]], [[Electronic (band)|Electronic]], [[Modest Mouse]], and [[the Cribs]], and he has become a prolific [[session musician]], working with names such as [[Kirsty MacColl]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Bryan Ferry]] and [[Hans Zimmer]].\n\nHaving released an album titled ''[[Boomslang (album)|Boomslang]]'' in 2003 under the name '''Johnny Marr and the Healers''', Marr released his first solo album, ''[[The Messenger (Johnny Marr album)|The Messenger]]'', in 2013. His second solo album, [[Playland (album)|''Playland'']], was released in 2014, followed by a third, ''[[Call the Comet]]'', in 2018. Marr's autobiography, ''Set the Boy Free'', was published in 2016.\n\nDescribed by [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' as \"the 1980s' most inventive and distinctive guitarist\", Marr was voted the fourth-best guitarist of the last 30 years in a poll conducted by the [[BBC]] in 2010. Phil Alexander, editor-in-chief of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', described him as \"arguably Britain's last great guitar stylist\". In 2013, ''[[NME]]'' honoured Marr with its \"Godlike Genius\" award.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}",
