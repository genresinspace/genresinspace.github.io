  "name": "Joe Strummer",
  "description": "'''John Graham Mellor''' (21 August 1952 – 22 December 2002), known professionally as '''Joe Strummer''', was a British musician. He was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist, and lead vocalist of [[punk rock]] band [[the Clash]], formed in 1976. The Clash's second studio album, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978), reached No. 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they achieved success in the US, starting with ''[[London Calling]]'' (1979) and peaking with ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), which reached No. 7 on the US charts and was certified 2× platinum there. The Clash's explosive political lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude greatly influenced rock music in general, especially [[alternative rock]]. Their music incorporated punk with [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[rockabilly]].\n\nStrummer's other career highlights included stints with [[the 101ers]], [[the Latino Rockabilly War]], [[the Mescaleros]] and [[the Pogues]], as well as solo music. His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests such as acting, scoring television shows and films, and hosting the [[BBC Radio]] show ''London Calling''. Strummer and the Clash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 2003. In his remembrance, Strummer's friends and family established [[the Joe Strummer Foundation]] (initially known as Strummerville), a [[non-profit organisation]] that gives opportunities to musicians and supports projects around the world that create empowerment through music.",
