Other names that he has released music under include \"DJ Snoopadelic\", \"Snoopzilla\", \"Bigg Snoop Dogg\", \"Snoop Lion\", and simply \"Snoop\".|group=note}} is an American rapper, singer, record producer, and actor. Rooted in [[West Coast hip-hop]], he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. Known for his signature [[drawl]]ed lyrics—which often use melodic rhyming, [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[word play]], [[Laconic phrase|laconic phrases]], [[syncopation]] and [[alliteration]]—his music often addresses the lifestyle and culture of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and social issues such as [[gun violence]] and\nstability for the youth. His initial fame dates back to 1992 following his guest appearance on [[Dr. Dre]]'s debut solo single, \"[[Deep Cover (song)|Deep Cover]]\", and later on Dre's debut album, ''[[The Chronic]]'', that same year, including \"[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]\". Snoop Dogg has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States, and 35 million albums worldwide. [[List of awards and nominations received by Snoop Dogg|His accolades]] include an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy Award]], two [[Sports Emmy Awards]], and seventeen [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations.\n\nProduced entirely by Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg's debut studio album, ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993) was released by [[Death Row Records]] and debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Selling 806,000 copies in its first week, the album received [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) the following year and spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top ten singles \"[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|What's My Name?]]\" and \"[[Gin and Juice]]\". He was the lead performer on Death Row's [[Murder Was the Case|soundtrack album]] for the 1994 short film ''Murder Was the Case'', wherein Snoop Dogg made his acting debut. He has since appeared in other [[Snoop Dogg filmography|films and popular media]]. His second album, ''[[Tha Doggfather]]'' (1996), also debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200 and received double platinum certification.\n\nIn 1998, he parted ways with Death Row in favor of [[Master P]]'s [[No Limit Records]], through which he saw largely continued success with his albums ''[[Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told]]'' (1998), ''[[No Limit Top Dogg]]'' (1999), and ''[[Tha Last Meal]]'' (2000). He then signed with [[Priority Records|Priority]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and [[EMI]] Records to release his sixth album ''[[Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss]]'' (2002), which was further commercially oriented. This effectively continued upon him signing with [[Geffen Records]] to release his next three albums: ''[[R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece]]'' (2004), ''[[Tha Blue Carpet Treatment]]'' (2006), and ''[[Ego Trippin']]'' (2008); the former spawned the single \"[[Drop It Like It's Hot]]\" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams|Pharrell]]), which became his first to peak atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. He then returned to Priority and Capitol—upon his hiring as chairman of the former label—to release his tenth and eleventh albums, ''[[Malice 'n Wonderland]]'' (2009) and ''[[Doggumentary]]'' (2011), both of which saw mild critical and commercial response.\n\nIn 2012, following a trip to [[Jamaica]], Snoop Dogg converted to [[Rastafari]] and adopted the alias '''Snoop Lion''', under which he released a [[reggae]] album, ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]]'' (2013), and a [[Reincarnated (film)|namesake documentary film]] about his Jamaican experience. His thirteenth studio album, [[Bush (album)|''Bush'']] (2015), was produced entirely by frequent collaborator Pharrell. His fourteenth studio album, ''[[Coolaid]]'' was released in 2016. In 2018, Snoop Dogg became \"a [[Born again|born-again Christian]]\" and released his first [[Gospel music|gospel]] album, ''[[Bible of Love]]'', in March of that year. Also that year, Snoop Dogg was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2022, he acquired Death Row Records from [[MNRK Music Group]] (formerly known as eOne Music), and released his nineteenth studio album, ''[[BODR]]'' (2022)—preceded by the independently-released ''[[I Wanna Thank Me]]'' (2019) and ''[[From tha Streets 2 tha Suites]]'' (2021). On December 13, 2024, he released his twentieth studio album, ''[[Missionary (album)|Missionary]]''. It became his highest-charting album since 2015, peaking within the top twenty of the ''Billboard'' 200.",
