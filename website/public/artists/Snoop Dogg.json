Selling 806,000 copies in its first week, the album received [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) the following year and spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top ten singles \"[[What's My Name?

He was the lead performer on Death Row's [[Murder Was the Case|soundtrack album]] for the 1994 short film ''Murder Was the Case'', wherein Snoop Dogg made his acting debut.

He then signed with [[Priority Records|Priority]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], and [[EMI]] Records to release his sixth album ''[[Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss]]'' (2002), which was further commercially oriented.

He then returned to Priority and Capitol—upon his hiring as chairman of the former label—to release his tenth and eleventh albums, ''[[Malice 'n Wonderland]]'' (2009) and ''[[Doggumentary]]'' (2011), both of which saw mild critical and commercial response.\n\nIn 2012, following a trip to [[Jamaica]], Snoop Dogg converted to [[Rastafari]] and adopted the alias '''Snoop Lion''', under which he released a [[reggae]] album, ''[[Reincarnated (album)|Reincarnated]]'' (2013), and a [[Reincarnated (film)|namesake documentary film]] about his Jamaican experience.
