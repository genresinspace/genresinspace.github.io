  "description": "'''Blood of Abraham''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] [[Duet (music)|duo]]  composed of '''Benyad''' (Benjamin Mor) and '''Mazik''' (David Saevitz). They debuted in 1993 with the release of the [[Album|LP]] ''[[Future Profits]]'' on [[Ruthless Records]].\n\nA key characteristic of the group was their unapologetic [[Jewish identity]]. Their best-known track is \"Niggaz and Jewz (Some Say [[Kike]]s)\", a call for black{{endash}}Jewish unity in the face of shared struggle against [[bigotry]]. Made at the height of the strain on Black-Jewish relations in the United States, its opening [[Sampling (music)|sample]] was an actual recording{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} of a [[Ku Klux Klan]]sman. It featured a verse from [[Eazy-E]] as well as the first recorded appearance by [[will.i.am]] of [[the Black Eyed Peas]] known then as Will 1X (the group was then known as \"Atban Klann\".) Other tracks dealing with Jewish themes were \"Father of Many Nations\" (a song in praise of the [[Biblical]] patriarch [[Abraham]]) and \"Stick To Your Own Kind\".\n\nA video was shot for the track \"Stabbed by the Steeple,\" and print ads were centered on large text proclaiming \"[[Jesus]] was a [[Black Jew]],\" but the album did not receive much publicity beyond that. Blood of Abraham fell into anonymity; their status worsened in 1995 with the death of Eazy-E and the folding of the Ruthless and [[Relativity Records]] labels.\n\nMazik and Benyad then went on hiatus until 2000, which saw the unofficial release of the LP ''Eyedollartree'' on Mastergrip Records, which folded shortly thereafter. ''Eyedollartree'' featured guest appearances from rappers [[Kool Keith]] and [[Divine Styler]], as well as production from will.i.am., Cyrus Melchor and Motiv8. Basement Records oversaw the official release of ''Eyedollartree'' (with bonus DVD) in late 2005.\n\nAs of late, former Blood of Abraham member Benjamin Mor has become an in-demand music video director. He has directed clips for [[Nas]], [[Katy Perry]] and a few music videos for the [[Black Eyed Peas]].",
