Letov collaborated with singer-songwriter [[Yanka Dyagileva]] and other Siberian underground artists as a record engineer and producer.\n\nLetov was one of the key figures of the Siberian punk scene. Posthumously, Letov has been called the \"father\" and \"patriarch\" of Russian punk rock, a \"musical legend\", and one of the most influential figures of the punk movement in Russia.\n\nIn addition to music, Letov was politically active, changing his political views from an [[anarchist]] rejection of the Soviet system in the late 1980s to [[national communism]] in the early 1990s. Together with [[Eduard Limonov]] and [[Alexander Dugin]], he founded the controversial [[National Bolshevik Party]] (NBP), now banned in Russia. He later distanced himself from the NBP over personal disagreements and instead endorsed the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] candidate [[Gennady Zyuganov]] in the [[1996 Russian presidential election|1996 presidential elections]], but retained his party card. In the last years of his life, he completely distanced himself from political activity and stated his rejection of any forms and manifestations of [[totalitarianism]].",
