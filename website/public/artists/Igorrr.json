  "description": "'''Gautier Serre''' (born 5 June 1984), better known by his stage name '''Igorrr''', is a French musician. Under the Igorrr alias, he combines a variety of disparate genres, including [[black metal]], [[baroque music]], [[breakcore]], and [[trip hop]], into a singular sound. Serre is also part of the now disbanded side-projects Whourkr and Corpo-Mente. The Igorrr project became a full band with the addition of vocalists Laure Le Prunenec and Laurent Lunoir, drummer Sylvain Bouvier, guitarist Martyn Clément and bassist Erlend Caspersen. In 2021, both vocalists left the band and were replaced with JB Le Bail and Aphrodite Patoulidou, who were later replaced by Marthe Alexandre. In 2024, Rémi Serafino took the position of the drummer.",
