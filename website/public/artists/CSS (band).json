  "description": "'''CSS''' (an initialism of '''Cansei de Ser Sexy''') ({{IPA|pt|kɐ̃ˈsej d(ʒi)seʁ ˈsɛksi|lang}}, English lit. \"[Got] tired of being sexy\") is a Brazilian [[rock music|rock]] band from [[São Paulo]]. The band was labelled as part of the explosion of the [[New Rave music|new rave]] scene of the late 2000s. CSS releases songs in both Portuguese and English, something which allowed them to develop a significant audience in the [[anglosphere]] in their formative years. In 2011 founding member [[Adriano Cintra]] left the band, which indirectly led to CSS becoming inactive between 2013 and 2019. The band reformed without Cintra in 2019, at first planning to simply play one gig in São Paulo, but its success drove the members to return full-time.",
