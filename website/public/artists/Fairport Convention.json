  "description": "'''Fairport Convention''' are an English [[British folk rock|folk rock]] band, formed in 1967 by guitarists [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and [[Simon Nicol]], bassist [[Ashley Hutchings]] and drummer Shaun Frater (with Frater replaced by [[Martin Lamble]] after their first gig). They started out influenced by American [[folk rock]], with a set list dominated by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] songs and a sound that earned them the nickname \"the British [[Jefferson Airplane]]\". Vocalists [[Judy Dyble]] and [[Iain Matthews]] joined them before the recording of [[Fairport Convention (album)|their self-titled debut]] in 1968; afterwards, Dyble was replaced by [[Sandy Denny]], and Matthews later left during the recording of their third album.\n\nDenny began steering the group towards [[British folk music|traditional British music]] for their next two albums, ''[[What We Did on Our Holidays]]'' and ''[[Unhalfbricking]]'' (both 1969); the latter featured [[fiddle]]r [[Dave Swarbrick|Dave \"Swarb\" Swarbrick]], most notably on the song \"[[A Sailor's Life]]\", which laid the groundwork for British folk rock by being the first time a traditional British song was combined with a rock beat. Shortly before the album's release, a crash on the [[M1 motorway]] killed Lamble and Jeannie Franklyn, Thompson's girlfriend; this resulted in the group retiring most of their prior material and turning entirely towards British folk music for their seminal album ''[[Liege & Lief]]'', released the same year. This style has been the band's focus ever since. For this album Swarbrick joined full-time, alongside drummer [[Dave Mattacks]]. Both Denny and Hutchings left before the year's end; the latter replaced by [[Dave Pegg]], who has remained the group's sole consistent member to this day; Thompson left after the recording of 1970's ''[[Full House (Fairport Convention album)|Full House]]''.\n\nThe 1970s saw numerous lineup changes around the core of Swarbrick and Pegg – Nicol being absent for the middle of the decade – and declining fortunes as folk music fell out of mainstream favour. Denny, whose partner [[Trevor Lucas]] had been a guitarist in the group since 1972, returned for the pop-oriented ''[[Rising for the Moon]]'' album in 1975 in a final bid to crack America; this effort failed, and after three more albums minus Denny and Lucas, the group disbanded in 1979. They played a farewell concert in the village of [[Cropredy]], Oxfordshire, where they had held small concerts since 1976, and this marked the beginning of the [[Cropredy Festival]] (since 2005 known as Fairport's Cropredy Convention) which has become the largest folk festival in Britain, with annual attendances of 20,000.\n\nThe band was reformed by Nicol, Pegg, and Mattacks in 1985, joined by [[Maartin Allcock]] (guitar, mandolin, keys, vocals) and [[Ric Sanders]] (fiddle, keyboards), and they have remained active since. Allcock was replaced by [[Chris Leslie (musician)|Chris Leslie]] (mandolin, violin, vocals) in 1996, and [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] replaced Mattacks in 1998. Conway departed in 2022, owing to [[Motor Neurone Disease]] which would claim his life in 2024, and Mattacks returned on a part-time basis. The group currently alternate between tours where Mattacks features and acoustic tours with just Nicol, Pegg, Sanders and Leslie. Their 29th studio album, ''[[Shuffle and Go]]'' was released in 2020, and they continue to headline Cropredy each year.\n\nDespite little mainstream success – their only top 40 single being \"[[Si Tu Dois Partir]]\", a French-language cover of the Dylan song \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" from ''Unhalfbricking'' – Fairport Convention remain highly influential in British folk rock and British folk in general. ''Liege & Lief'' was named the \"Most Influential Folk Album of All Time\" at the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] in 2006, and Pegg's playing style, which incorporates [[jig]]s and [[Reel (dance)|reels]] into his basslines, has been imitated by many in the folk rock and [[folk punk]] genres. Additionally, many former members went on to form or join other notable groups in the genre, including [[Fotheringay]], [[Steeleye Span]], and [[the Albion Band]]; along with solo careers, most notably Thompson and Denny. Sandy Denny, now regarded as being amongst Britain's finest female singer-songwriters, died in 1978; her song \"[[Who Knows Where the Time Goes?]]\" – recorded by Fairport on ''Unhalfbricking'' – became a signature song for herself and the band.",
