  "name": "Mach-Hommy",
  "description": "'''Mach-Hommy''' is an American rapper and record producer. He is known for concealing his real name and face in all public appearances, a practice that has led him to be described as \"one of hip-hop's most elusive artists\".\n\nMach-Hommy has gained a [[cult following]] as a result of his work ethic and sense of mystery. His lyrics are often heavily related to the social and political history of his Haitian heritage. Though he predominantly raps in English, he also frequently incorporates [[Haitian Creole|Haitian Kreyòl]] into his lyrics. He disallows his lyrics from being posted on lyric sites, describing such republishing as the sites \"monetizing\" his work, and he charges hundreds and even thousands of dollars for his releases, many of which are not available on [[streaming services]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}",
