They are managed by the multimedia talent agency [[Starto Entertainment]] (formerly [[Johnny & Associates]]) and signed to [[J Storm|Infinity Records]]. The group was formed in 2002 and made their CD debut in 2004 as \"Johnny's modern [[enka]] group\", though after the year 2006, their sound and style has become a mix of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. Like the rest of the acts managed under Johnny & Associates, Super Eight also perform in various other areas of the Japanese entertainment industry such as variety show hosting, television, movie, and stage acting, and radio talk show hosting. They sold 17 million copies in Japan. Starting on February 4, 2024, the group's name changed to Super Eight, following the decisions taken at the agency to eliminate \"Johnny\" from everything related to the group in the wake of the [[Johnny Kitagawa sexual abuse scandal]].",
