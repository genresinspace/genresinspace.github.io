The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]], lead guitarist [[Ray Toro]], rhythm guitarist [[Frank Iero]], and bassist [[Mikey Way]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock groups of the [[2000s in music|2000s]] and a major act in the [[emo]] and [[pop-punk]] genres, despite the band rejecting the former label.\n\nFormed in September 2001 by Gerard, Mikey, Toro, and drummer Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with [[Eyeball Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love]]'', in 2002. They signed with [[Reprise Records]] the next year and released their major-label debut, ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]'', in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was replaced by [[Bob Bryar]]. The album was a commercial success, attaining platinum status over a year later.\n\nThe success of the band's previous albums was eclipsed by that of their 2006 [[rock opera]] [[concept album]], ''[[The Black Parade]]''. A major commercial success, its lead single \"[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]\" topped the UK singles chart. The album solidified the band's following, despite negative coverage in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' generating controversy. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]'', was released in 2010. Bryar departed the band prior to the release of the album, and in 2012, they added touring keyboardist [[James Dewees]]. In 2012 and 2013, the band released a series of singles they had recorded in 2009 under the collective title ''[[Conventional Weapons]]''. My Chemical Romance announced its breakup on March 22, 2013. They released a [[greatest hits album]], ''[[May Death Never Stop You]]'', in 2014.\n\nThe band announced their reunion in October 2019, with a reunion show taking place in December.
