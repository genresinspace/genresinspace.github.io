  "description": "'''Maria Carta''' (24 June 1934 – 22 September 1994) was a Sardinian [[folk music]] singer-songwriter. She also performed in film and theatre. In 1975 she wrote a book of poetry, ''Canto rituale'' (Ritual Song).\n\nThroughout her 25-year career she covered the richly diverse genres of traditional music of her native [[Sardinia]] ([[Cantu a chiterra]], ninne nanne—children's lullabies, [[Music of Sardinia|goso]]s, [[Gregorian chant]]s, and more), often updating them with a modern and personal touch. She succeeded in bringing Sardinian folk music into wider popular awareness in demonstrations at a national level in Italy (like the [[Canzonissima]] in 1974) as well as internationally (especially in France and the United States).",
