  "description": "'''Avenged Sevenfold''' (abbreviated as '''A7X''') is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Huntington Beach, California]], formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist [[M. Shadows]], guitarists [[Zacky Vengeance]] and [[Synyster Gates]], bassist [[Johnny Christ]], and drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]].\n\nAvenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. The band emerged with a [[metalcore]] sound on their debut album ''[[Sounding the Seventh Trumpet]]''; they largely continued this sound through their second album ''[[Waking the Fallen]]''. The band's style had evolved by their third album and first major label release, ''[[City of Evil]]'', into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its [[Avenged Sevenfold (album)|self-titled release]] and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their founding drummer, [[The Rev|Jimmy \"The Rev\" Sullivan]], died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of [[Dream Theater]] member [[Mike Portnoy]], and released and toured in support of their fifth album ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]'' in 2010, which debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their first number one debut.\n\nIn 2011, drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album ''[[Hail to the King (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Hail to the King]]'', which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. It would feature a heavy metal and hard rock style, with it being written as a tribute to their influences. ''Hail to the King'' charted as number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. Ilejay left the band in late 2014 and was replaced by former [[Bad Religion]] drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]], but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album ''[[The Stage (album)|The Stage]]'' in October 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in the US. ''The Stage'' is their first [[Concept album|conceptual album]] and marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a [[progressive metal]] sound. The band released their eighth studio album, ''[[Life Is But a Dream...]]'', a highly experimental record, in June 2023.\n\nTo date, Avenged Sevenfold have released eight studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide, and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution ([[RIAA]]). They have also created four original songs for the ''[[Call of Duty (series)|Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP ''[[Black Reign (EP)|Black Reign]]''. The band were ranked No. 47 on ''[[Loudwire]]'s'' list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time. Christina Fuoco of ''[[AllMusic]]'' called Avenged Sevenfold \"one of the more successful and accessible metalcore outfits of the early 21st century.\"",
