  "description": "'''Steeleye Span''' are a British [[folk rock]] band formed in 1969 in England by [[Fairport Convention]] bass player [[Ashley Hutchings]] and established London folk club duo [[Tim Hart]] and [[Maddy Prior]]. The band were part of the 1970s [[British folk revival]], and were commercially successful in that period, with four Top 40 albums and two hit singles: \"[[Gaudete]]\" and \"[[All Around My Hat (song)|All Around My Hat]]\".\n\nSteeleye Span have seen many personnel changes, with Maddy Prior being the only remaining original member of the band. Their musical repertoire consists of mostly traditional songs with one or two instrumental tracks of [[jig]]s and/or [[reel (dance)|reels]] added; the traditional songs often include some of the [[Child Ballads]]. In their later albums there has been an increased tendency to include music written by the band members, but they have never moved completely away from traditional music, which draws upon pan-British traditions.",
