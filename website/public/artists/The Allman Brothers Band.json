  "description": "'''The Allman Brothers Band''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in 1969. The eponymous brothers [[Duane Allman|Duane]] (slide guitar, lead guitar) and [[Gregg Allman]] (vocals, keyboards) founded it with [[Dickey Betts]] (lead guitar, vocals), [[Berry Oakley]] (bass), [[Butch Trucks]] (drums), and [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson]] (drums). Subsequently based in [[Macon, Georgia]], they incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[country music]] and their live shows featured [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.\n\nThe band's first two studio albums, ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' (1969) and ''[[Idlewild South]]'' (1970), both released by [[Capricorn Records]], stalled commercially but their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'' was a critical and commercial breakthrough. It included extended versions of \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\" and \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", showcasing the group's jamming style. Group leader Duane was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971; however the band continued, releasing ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' in 1972, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg's \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\" and Betts's \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\". Following the motorcycling death of Oakley in 1972, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973's ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]].'' The album included Betts's hit single \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\" and instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\", both of which went on to become [[classic rock]] radio staples and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after as the group dissolved in 1976, reforming briefly in 1978 with additional personnel changes and breaking up again in 1982. The band re-formed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of Butch) and became renowned for their month-long concert residencies at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] each spring. The band retired in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre. Butch Trucks and Gregg both died in 2017, and Betts died in 2024, leaving Jaimoe as the only surviving original member. \n\nThe band was awarded seven [[Gold (RIAA certification)|Gold]] and four [[Platinum (RIAA certification)|Platinum]] albums by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked the band 52nd on its list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\".",
