  "description": "'''Edward Kennedy''' \"'''Duke'''\" '''Ellington''' (April 29, 1899 â€“ May 24, 1974) was an American [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]], composer, and leader of his eponymous [[Big band|jazz orchestra]] from 1924 through the rest of his life. \n\nBorn and raised in [[Washington, D.C.]], Ellington was based in [[New York City]] from the mid-1920s and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the [[Cotton Club]] in [[Harlem]]. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78&nbsp;rpm recording format, Ellington wrote or collaborated on more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, and many of his pieces have become [[Standard (music)|standards]]. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\", which brought a [[Spanish tinge]] to big band jazz.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s, Ellington began a nearly thirty five-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom he called his writing and arranging companion. With Strayhorn, he composed multiple extended compositions, or suites, as well as many short pieces. For a few years at the beginning of Strayhorn's involvement, Ellington's orchestra featured bassist [[Jimmy Blanton]] and tenor saxophonist [[Ben Webster]], and reached what many claim to be a creative peak for the group. Some years later following a low-profile period, an appearance by Ellington and his orchestra at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in July 1956 led to a major revival and regular world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals.\n\nAlthough a pivotal figure in the history of [[jazz]], in the opinion of [[Gunther Schuller]] and [[Barry Kernfeld]], \"the most significant composer of the genre\", Ellington himself embraced the phrase \"beyond category\", considering it a liberating principle, and referring to his music as part of the more general category of American Music. Ellington was known for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, as well as for his eloquence and charisma. He was awarded a posthumous [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Prize Special Award]] for music in 1999.",
