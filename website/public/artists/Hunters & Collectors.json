The group reformed in 2013 with the 1998 line-up.\n\nOriginally influenced by [[krautrock]] and the productions of [[Conny Plank]], Hunters & Collectors' early music featured abrasive percussion, noisy guitar, and driving bass lines, producing a tribal [[post-punk]] sound exemplified by their debut single, \"[[Talking to a Stranger (song)|Talking to a Stranger]]\" (1982). The band recruited Plank to produce two of their early albums, ''[[The Fireman's Curse]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Jaws of Life (Hunters & Collectors album)|The Jaws of Life]]'' (1984), though neither charted in the Top 50 of the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart. \n\nA turning point came with ''[[Human Frailty]]'' (1986), their first Top 10 album, which marked a shift toward a more polished, anthemic [[pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] sound. This evolution continued with later charting releases, including ''[[Ghost Nation (album)|Ghost Nation]]'' (1989), ''[[Cut (Hunters and Collectors album)|Cut]]'' (1992), and ''[[Demon Flower]]'' (1994).\n \nAmong their best-charting singles were \"[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]\" (1984), \"[[Say Goodbye (Hunters & Collectors song)|Say Goodbye]]\" (1986), \"[[When the River Runs Dry]]\" (1989), \"[[True Tears of Joy]]\" (1992), and \"[[Holy Grail (Hunters & Collectors song)|Holy Grail]]\" (1993). \n\nThey became one of the most popular live acts in Australia. Musicologist [[Ian McFarlane]] noted that their \"great achievement was to lay bare human emotions in the intensely ritualistic milieu of the pub-rock gig\".",
