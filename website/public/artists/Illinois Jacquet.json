  "description": "'''Jean-Baptiste Illinois Jacquet''' (October 30, 1922 â€“ July 22, 2004) was an American [[jazz]] tenor saxophonist, best remembered for his solo on \"[[Flying Home]]\", critically recognized as the first [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] saxophone solo. He is also known as one of the writers of the jazz standard \"[[Don'cha Go 'Way Mad]].\"\n\nAlthough he was a pioneer of the honking [[tenor saxophone]] that became a regular feature of jazz playing and a hallmark of early [[rock and roll]], Jacquet was a skilled and melodic improviser, both on up-tempo tunes and ballads. He doubled on the [[bassoon]], one of only a few jazz musicians to use the instrument.",
