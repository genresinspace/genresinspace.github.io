  "description": "'''Earl Simmons''' (December 18, 1970 – April 9, 2021), known professionally as '''DMX''', was an American rapper and actor. The recipient of various accolades, he won an [[American Music Award]], a [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]], and was nominated for six [[Grammy Awards]]. Regarded as an influential figure in the late 1990s and one of the greats of [[hip-hop]], his music is characterized by his \"aggressive\" rapping style, with lyrical content varying from [[Hardcore hip-hop|hardcore]] themes to [[prayer]]s. His violent lyricism helped popularize the [[horrorcore]] genre.\n\nDMX began rapping in the early 1990s. After an unsuccessful tenure on [[Columbia Records]], he signed with [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment]] in a joint venture with [[Def Jam Recordings]] to release his debut studio album, ''[[It's Dark and Hell Is Hot]]'' (1998), which was met with critical and commercial success—selling 251,000 copies in its first week and spawning the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top 20 single, \"[[Ruff Ryders' Anthem]]\". His second album, ''[[Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood]]'' (1998), was followed by his third, {{nowrap|''[[... And Then There Was X]]''}} (1999), which became his best-selling release and was supported by his second top 40 single, \"[[Party Up (Up in Here)]]\". His fourth album, ''[[The Great Depression (DMX album)|The Great Depression]]'' (2001), was followed by his fifth, ''[[Grand Champ]]'' (2003), which was led by the single \"[[Where the Hood At?]]\" and included the international bonus track \"[[X Gon' Give It to Ya]]\". DMX became the first artist to have their first five albums consecutively debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and by his death on April 9, 2021, he had sold over 75 million records worldwide.\n\nDMX acted in commercially successful films such as ''[[Belly (film)|Belly]]'' (1998), alongside rapper [[Nas]], ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' (2000) and ''[[Cradle 2 the Grave]]'' (2003), alongside [[Jet Li]], and ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' (2001), alongside [[Steven Seagal]]. In 2006, he starred in the reality television series ''[[DMX: Soul of a Man]]'', which was primarily aired on the [[Black Entertainment Television (BET)|BET]] [[cable television]] network. In 2003, he published a book of his memoirs titled ''E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX''.",
