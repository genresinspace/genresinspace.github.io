  "name": "Jesu",
  "description": "'''Jesu''' (pronounced ''\"yay-zoo\"'')  are a British [[experimental metal]] band formed in 2003 by [[Justin Broadrick]] following the breakup of his band [[Godflesh]]. It shares its name with the last song on ''[[Hymns (Godflesh album)|Hymns]]'', the final album of Godflesh's initial run. Jesu's sound is heavily layered and textured, incorporating a diverse mix of influences. Broadrick himself has stated that \"...it's very loosely speaking pop/rock/[[heavy metal music|metal]]/[[electronica]] ... I'm intentionally writing what I consider to be coherent 'pop' songs\".",
