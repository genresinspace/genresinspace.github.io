  "description": "'''Norman Quentin Cook''' (born '''Quentin Leo Cook''', 31 July 1963), known professionally as '''Fatboy Slim''', is an English musician and [[DJ]] who helped popularise the [[big beat]] genre in the 1990s. His music makes extensive use of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from eclectic genres, combined with pop structures, processed rhythms and \"sloganistic\" vocals.\n\nIn the 1980s, Cook was the bassist for the [[indie rock]] band [[the Housemartins]], who achieved a UK number-one single with their cover of \"[[Caravan of Love]]\". After the Housemartins split, Cook moved to [[Brighton]] to pursue dance music. He formed the electronic group [[Beats International]], who produced the number-one single \"[[Dub Be Good to Me]]\" in 1990, and played in the band [[Freak Power]]. He also released [[House music|house]] records under names including [[Pizzaman (duo)|Pizzaman]] and the '''Mighty Dub Katz'''.\n\nIn 1996, Cook released his first album as Fatboy Slim, ''[[Better Living Through Chemistry (album)|Better Living Through Chemistry]]'', followed by successful [[Remix|remixes]] for [[Roger McKenzie (musician)|Wildchild]] and [[Cornershop]]. His second album, ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]],'' was [[certified platinum]] and produced the successful singles \"[[The Rockafeller Skank]]\", \"[[Praise You]]\" and \"[[Right Here, Right Now (Fatboy Slim song)|Right Here, Right Now]]\". ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'' (2000) produced the single \"[[Weapon of Choice (song)|Weapon of Choice]]\", which won six awards at the [[2001 MTV Video Music Awards]]. ''[[Palookaville (album)|Palookaville]]'' (2004) was less successful, attributed to the declining popularity of dance music and a more obscure style. In 2009, Cook released an album as the [[Brighton Port Authority]], a collaboration with artists including [[David Byrne]]. He collaborated with Byrne again on the album ''[[Here Lies Love]]'' (2010), a [[concept album]] that was [[Here Lies Love (musical)|adapted into a stage musical]] in 2013. In later years, Cook has focused on DJ performances over creating music.  \n\nCook has a [[Grammy Award]], nine [[MTV Video Music Awards]], two [[Brit Awards]] and an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]]. He was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Original Score]] for ''Here Lies Love'' in 2024.
