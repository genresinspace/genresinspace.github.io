  "description": "'''Napalm Death''' are an English [[grindcore]] band formed in [[Meriden, West Midlands]], in 1981. None of the band's original members have been in the group since 1986, but since ''[[Utopia Banished]]'' (1992), the lineup of bassist [[Shane Embury]], guitarist [[Mitch Harris]], drummer Danny Herrera and lead vocalist [[Barney Greenway|Mark \"Barney\" Greenway]] has remained consistent through most of the band's career. From 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added [[Jesse Pintado]] and [[Mitch Harris]] as replacements for guitarist [[Bill Steer]]. Following Pintado's departure, the band reverted to a four-piece.\n\nThe band is credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of [[crust punk]] and [[death metal]], using a noise-filled sound that uses [[Distortion (music)|distorted]], [[Dropped tuning|down-tuned guitars]], grinding [[Fuzz bass|overdrive bass]], high-speed [[tempo]], [[blast beat]]s, vocals that consist of incomprehensible [[Death growl|growls]] or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'', released in 1987 by [[Earache Records]], proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. According to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', their song \"[[You Suffer]]\" is the shortest song ever recorded, at 1.316 seconds long. By their third album ''[[Harmony Corruption]]'' (1990), the band shifted to death metal and began writing longer songs.\n\nNapalm Death have released sixteen studio albums, and as of 2003 are listed by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] as the seventh-best-selling death metal band in the United States. According to former vocalist [[Lee Dorrian]], ''Scum'' and ''[[From Enslavement to Obliteration]]'' (1988) have sold a combined total of 400,000 copies worldwide.",
