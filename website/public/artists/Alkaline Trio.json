  "description": "'''Alkaline Trio''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Chicago]]. The band's current members are [[Matt Skiba]] (guitar, vocals), [[Dan Andriano]] (bass, vocals), and [[Atom Willard]] (drums).\n\nFounded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \"[[Sundials (song)|Sundials]]\", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano, who occupied the role of co-lead vocalist alongside Skiba. The band subsequently recorded an EP, ''[[For Your Lungs Only]]'' (1998), and its debut studio album, ''[[Goddamnit]]'' (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, ''[[Maybe I'll Catch Fire]]'' (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by [[Mike Felumlee]] for its subsequent album, ''[[From Here to Infirmary]]'' (2001).\n\nBacked by the singles \"[[Stupid Kid]]\" and \"[[Private Eye (song)|Private Eye]]\", ''From Here to Infirmary'' significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, ''[[Good Mourning (album)|Good Mourning]]'' (2003), charted highly on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''Good Mourning'' marked the recording debut of longtime drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released ''[[Crimson (Alkaline Trio album)|Crimson]]'' which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent [[overdubs]] and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on ''[[Agony & Irony]]'' (2008), which was released on Epic Records.\n\nIn 2010, the band released ''[[This Addiction]]'' on its own label Heart & Skull and [[Epitaph records|Epitaph]]. Recorded in the band's home town of [[Chicago]], with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest-charting album of their career, debuting on the ''Billboard'' 200 at No.&nbsp;11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of ''[[Damnesia]]'', which featured new, [[acoustic music|acoustic]]-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, ''[[My Shame Is True]]'', was released on April 2, 2013, while their ninth album, ''[[Is This Thing Cursed?]]'' was released on August 31, 2018, followed by a three track [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''E.P.'' on March 19, 2020.\n\nIn June 2023, Grant departed from the band after twenty-two years, with Atom Willard being announced as his replacement soon thereafter. Their tenth album (and their final one with Grant), ''[[Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs]]'', was released on January 26, 2024.",
