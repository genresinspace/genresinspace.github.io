  "description": "'''Chthonic''' (styled as '''ChthoniC''' or '''ChThoniC''') is a Taiwanese [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, formed in 1995 in [[Taipei]]. They have been called \"the [[Black Sabbath]] of Asia.\" The group incorporates influences from traditional [[Taiwanese music]], including adaptations of folk songs and the use of traditional instruments, most notably the [[erhu]] (often called the ''hiân-á'' [{{lang|zh|絃仔}}] in the band's native [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]). Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history (for example, those experienced by the [[Seediq people]]).\n\nSince 2011 their trademark erhu has been complemented with stringed instruments including the [[koto (instrument)|koto]] and [[shamisen]], as well as [[Tingsha|Tibetan bells]] and [[shakuhachi]] and Seediq hunting flutes ({{Lang-zh|c=獵首笛}}), the last of which are traditionally used by the [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|indigenous people of Taiwan]]. The band members are also acclaimed artists and political activists who advocate [[Taiwan independence movement|independence for Taiwan]] and self-determination for Tibetans and Uighurs. Singer [[Freddy Lim]] served as Chairman of the Taiwan chapter of [[Amnesty International]] from 2010 to 2014 and has been a [[List of members of the ninth Legislative Yuan|legislator since 2016]], first representing the [[New Power Party]] before becoming an independent. Since their formation, Chthonic has released eight studio albums. The most recent of which, ''[[Battlefields of Asura]]'', was released in October 2018.",
