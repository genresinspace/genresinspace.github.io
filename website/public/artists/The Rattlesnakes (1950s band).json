  "description": "'''The Rattlesnakes''' was a British [[skiffle]]/[[rock and roll]] group, founded in [[Manchester]] in 1955 by [[Barry Gibb]], which later changed to become the [[Bee Gees]] in 1958. They were one of the many skiffle bands that were formed in the United Kingdom in the 1950s since the revival of the American skiffle in the UK that was originally started in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.\n\nBarry started a skiffle group, in which his younger brothers [[Robin Gibb|Robin]] and [[Maurice Gibb]] also joined as vocalists, after they returned to their parents' hometown in Manchester, England, in 1955. They were later joined by their friends and neighbours, Paul Frost (drums) and Kenny Horrocks ([[Washtub bass|tea-chest bass]]). Their first public performance took place at Gaumont Cinema in December 1957, performing [[the Everly Brothers]]' \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]\". Some of their influences at that time were [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Tommy Steele]], [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Paul Anka]].",
