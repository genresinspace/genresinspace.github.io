Anderson (vocals, harp, guitars), the band was later joined by Jason William Walton (bass) and Timothy Glenn (percussion). Celestiial is known for using numerous instruments in its music, combining traditional folk instruments with those more typically used in metal music, as well as sampling the sounds of the natural world. Celestiial's music is intended to evoke images of the natural world.\n\nAfter producing a demo, ''[[Ashen (demo)|Ashen]]'' (2004), Celestiial was signed to [[Bindrune Recordings]].
