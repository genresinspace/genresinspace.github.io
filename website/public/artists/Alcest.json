  "description": "'''Alcest''' ({{IPAc-en|a:|l|ˈ|s|ɛ|s|t}}) is a French [[post-black metal]] band from [[Bagnols-sur-Cèze]], founded and led by [[Neige (musician)|Neige]] (Stéphane Paut). It began in 2000 as a [[black metal]] solo project by Neige, then became a trio, but members Aegnor and Argoth left the band following the 2001 release of their [[Tristesse hivernale|first demo]], leaving Neige as the sole member. Neige began incorporating elements of [[shoegaze]] and [[post-metal]] into the project's sound from 2005 onwards. In 2009, drummer Winterhalter from [[Les Discrets]] joined Alcest, after eight years with Neige as its sole full-time member.\n\nSince its creation, Alcest has released seven studio albums and three EPs. Their fourth album, 2014's ''[[Shelter (Alcest album)|Shelter]]'', marked a shift towards a distinctly [[shoegaze]] sound, while their subsequent album ''[[Kodama (album)|Kodama]]'' (2016) returned to their earlier [[blackgaze]] sound. Alcest is widely credited with pioneering the blackgaze/post-black metal genre, particularly with their 2005 EP ''[[Le Secret (EP)|Le secret]]''.",
