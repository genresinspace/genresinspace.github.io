  "description": "'''Aerosmith''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Boston]] in 1970. The group consists of lead vocalist [[Steven Tyler]], bassist [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]], drummer [[Joey Kramer]], and guitarists [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] and [[Brad Whitford]]. Their style, which is rooted in [[blues]]-based [[hard rock]], has also incorporated elements of [[pop rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[glam metal]], and [[rhythm and blues]], and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. Aerosmith is sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band\". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is sometimes referred to as the \"[[Toxic Twins]]\".\n\nPerry and Hamilton were originally in a band together, the Jam Band, where they met up with Tyler, Kramer, guitarist [[Ray Tabano]], and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their [[Aerosmith (album)|eponymous debut]] in 1973, followed a year later by ''[[Get Your Wings]]''. The band broke into the mainstream with their next two albums, ''[[Toys in the Attic (album)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1975) and ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'' (1976). ''[[Draw the Line (Aerosmith album)|Draw the Line]]'' and ''[[Night in the Ruts]]'' followed in 1977 and 1979, respectively. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] singles, including their first [[Top 40]] hit \"[[Sweet Emotion]]\" and the Top 10 hits \"[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]\" and \"[[Walk This Way]]\". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the \"[[Blue Army (Aerosmith)|Blue Army]]\". [[Drug addiction]] and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively. The band did not fare well and the album ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'' (1982) failed to match previous successes.\n\nPerry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After [[Back in the Saddle Tour|a comeback tour]], they recorded ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group [[Run-DMC|Run–D.M.C.]] on a remake of \"[[Walk This Way]]\", and the band's multi-platinum album, ''[[Permanent Vacation (Aerosmith album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' (1987), that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'' (1989), ''[[Get a Grip]]'' (1993), and ''[[Nine Lives (Aerosmith album)|Nine Lives]]'' (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included \"[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]\", \"[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]]\", \"[[Rag Doll (Aerosmith song)|Rag Doll]]\", \"[[Love in an Elevator]]\", \"[[Janie's Got a Gun]]\", \"[[What It Takes (Aerosmith song)|What it Takes]]\", \"[[Livin' on the Edge]]\", \"[[Cryin']]\", and \"[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]\". The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with \"[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\" from [[Armageddon: The Album|''Armageddon'''s soundtrack]] and the following year, [[Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith|their roller coaster attraction]] opened at [[Walt Disney World]]. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums ''[[Just Push Play]]'' (which included the hit \"[[Jaded (Aerosmith song)|Jaded]]\"), ''[[Honkin' on Bobo]]'' (a collection of blues [[cover version|covers]]), and ''[[Music from Another Dimension!]]'' followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012, respectively. In 2008, they released ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'', which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. From 2019 to 2022, the band had a [[Aerosmith: Deuces are Wild|concert residency in Las Vegas]], which was interrupted from 2020 to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. After Tyler suffered (and ultimately failed to recover from) a vocal injury in 2023 during the third date of their [[Peace Out: The Farewell Tour|farewell tour]], the band retired from touring in 2024.\n\nAerosmith is [[List of best-selling music artists|the best-selling American hard rock band of all time]], having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85&nbsp;million records in the United States. With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total [[RIAA certification|certifications]] by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, nine number-one [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock]] hits, four [[Grammy Award]]s, six [[American Music Awards]], and ten [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and in 2020, the band received the [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] award.",
