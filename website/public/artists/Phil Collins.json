  "description": "'''Philip David Charles Collins''' (born 30 January 1951) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer and actor. He was the drummer and later became the lead singer of the rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and had a successful solo career, achieving three UK number-one singles and seven US number-one singles as a solo artist. In total, his work with Genesis, other artists and solo resulted in more US top-40 singles than any other artist throughout the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include \"[[In the Air Tonight]]\", \"[[Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)]]\", \"[[One More Night (Phil Collins song)|One More Night]]\", \"[[Sussudio]]\", \"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\", \"[[Two Hearts (Phil Collins song)|Two Hearts]]\" and \"[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]\".\n\nBorn and raised in west London, Collins began playing drums at the age of five. During the same period he attended drama school, which helped secure various roles as a child actor. His first major role was the [[Artful Dodger]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of the musical ''[[Oliver!]]''. As an accomplished professional actor by his early teens, he pivoted to pursue a music career, becoming the drummer for Genesis in 1970. He took over the role of lead singer in 1975 following the departure of [[Peter Gabriel]]. During the second half of the 1970s, in between Genesis albums and tours, Collins was the drummer of jazz rock band [[Brand X]]. While continuing to perform and record with Genesis, Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of [[soul music]], releasing the albums ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]'' (1982), ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985) and ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989). Collins became, in the words of [[AllMusic]], \"one of the most successful pop and [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] singers of the '80s and beyond\". He became known for a distinctive [[gated reverb]] drum sound on many of his recordings. He played drums on the 1984 charity single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" and, in July 1985, he was the only artist to perform at both [[Live Aid]] concerts. He resumed his acting career, appearing in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' and subsequently starring in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988).\n\nCollins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s animated film ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' (1999), for which he wrote and performed the songs \"[[Two Worlds (song)|Two Worlds]]\", \"[[Son of Man (song)|Son of Man]]\", \"[[Strangers Like Me]]\" and \"[[You'll Be in My Heart]]\", the last of which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. He rejoined Genesis for their [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released his memoir in 2016 and conducted the [[Not Dead Yet Tour]] from 2017 to 2019. He then rejoined Genesis in 2020 for a [[The Last Domino? Tour|second and final reunion tour]], which ran from 2021 to 2022.\n\n[[Phil Collins discography|Collins's discography]] includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150&nbsp;million records sold worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling artists]].
