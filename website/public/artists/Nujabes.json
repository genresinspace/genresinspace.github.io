He was the founder of the independent label [[Hydeout Productions]] and released two collection compilations: ''[[Hydeout Productions 1st Collection]]'' (2003) and ''[[Hydeout Productions 2nd Collection|2nd Collection]]'' (2007). Additionally, Seba collaborated on the soundtrack for [[Shinichirō Watanabe]]'s [[anime]] series ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'' (''[[Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure|Music Record: Departure]]'' and ''[[Samurai Champloo Music Record: Impression|Impression]]'') in 2004.\n\nSeba was an intensely private person and was a reluctant public figure throughout his career, who wanted the focus to be on his music and not on himself. He avoided interviews, promotional activities and so few were his photos that many fans were not even sure what he looked like.\n\nIn 2010, Seba died in a traffic collision at the age of 36. Although relatively niche during his lifetime, Seba has since achieved posthumous acclaim and been referred as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|\"godfather\"]] of [[lo-fi hip hop]].",
