  "name": "The Berzerker",
  "description": "'''The Berzerker''' are an Australian/British [[death metal|industrial death metal]] band from [[Melbourne]] formed in 1995. The band's music, heavily influenced by older [[death metal]] and [[grindcore]] bands such as [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Obituary (band)| Obituary]], and [[Napalm Death]], can be characterised as a fusion of these with [[speedcore]], and [[gabber]]. The band's founding member Luke Kenny described the band's style as industrial death metal.\n\nThe Berzerker has produced five full-length albums, ''[[The Berzerker (album)|The Berzerker]]'' (2000), ''[[Dissimulate (album)|Dissimulate]]'' (2002), ''[[World of Lies (album)|World of Lies]]'' (2005), ''[[Animosity (The Berzerker album)|Animosity]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Reawakening]]'' (2008). These were released through [[Earache Records]], with the exception of the last album, which was self-released through Berserker Industries. During the early part of their career as a live act, band members were identified only as The Vocalist, The Guitarist, The Bassist and The Drummer, distinguishable on stage only by the masks they wore. However, the group eventually abandoned this device, after the masks became unhygienic with age, and to avoid unfavorable comparisons with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]].\n\nA DVD documentary, ''The Principles and Practices of The Berzerker'' (2004), includes several hours of live concert footage, as well as the first public images of the band members without their masks.\n\nMost of the band's music videos have been banned from broadcast for reasons such as the possible [[epileptic seizure]]-inducing imagery contained in the video \"Forever\", and the horrific imagery of \"Reality\". The latter features graphic images of cadavers and body parts.",
