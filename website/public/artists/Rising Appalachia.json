Their music is rooted in the landscapes of [[Atlanta]], [[New Orleans]], and the southern [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of [[Appalachia]].{{sfn|Orris|n.d.}} The group blends a diverse range of instruments, including [[banjo]]s, fiddle, cello, [[Double bass|upright bass]], baritone guitar, [[djembe]], and world percussion, as well as styles, including [[Americana music|Americana]], [[world music|world]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[soul music]].\n\nRising Appalachia is noted for their nonconformity to the mainstream [[music industry]]. From the outset the Smith sisters independently managed and financed their music. Their musical career began with a gift of music for their close circle. The unexpectedly positive reception spurred them to establish Rising Appalachia as a group.\n\nThe collective's identity has evolved through various phases, including a stint as R.I.S.E., during which they released the live album ''Evolutions in Sound''. They worked to unite art with [[activism]] and community engagement, which led to the inception of the Rise Collective: a diverse assembly of performers, educators, activists, and artists. This collaborative effort worked in various artistic media, from [[acro-yoga]] to [[fire spinning]] and sound workshops.\n\nRising Appalachia has played musical festivals across the globe.{{sfn|Brooklyn Daily|2008}} {{sfn|Alexander|2011}}{{sfn|NPR|2006}} They have released albums such as the [[crowd-funded]] ''Filthy Dirty South''{{sfn|Rising Appalachia|2011k}} as well as ''Leylines''.",
