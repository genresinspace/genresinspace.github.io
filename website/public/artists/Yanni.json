Although this genre of music was not well suited for commercial [[pop radio]] and music television, Yanni received international recognition by producing concerts at historic monuments and by producing videos that were broadcast on public television. His breakthrough concert, ''[[Live at the Acropolis]],'' yielded the second best-selling music concert video of all time. Additional historic sites for Yanni's concerts have included India's [[Taj Mahal]], China's [[Forbidden City]], the United Arab Emirates' [[Burj Khalifa]], Russia's [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], Puerto Rico's [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro|El Morro castle]], Lebanon's ancient city of [[Byblos]], Tunisia's Roman Theatre of [[Carthage]], India's [[Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara|Laxmi Vilas Palace]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]] and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], and the [[Amman Citadel]].\n\nAt least sixteen of Yanni's albums have peaked at No. 1 in ''Billboard's'' \"Top New Age Album\" category, and two albums (''[[Dare to Dream (Yanni album)|Dare to Dream]]'' and ''[[In My Time]]'') received [[Grammy Award]] nominations. Yanni has performed in more than 30 countries on five continents, and through late 2015 had performed live in concert before more than 5&nbsp;million people and had accumulated more than 40&nbsp;platinum and gold albums globally, with sales totaling more than 25&nbsp;million copies. A longtime fundraiser for public television, Yanni's compositions have been used on commercial television programs, especially for sporting events. He has written film scores and the music for an award-winning [[British Airways face advertisement|British Airways television commercial]].\n\nYanni popularized the combination of electronic music synthesizers with a full symphony orchestra. He has employed musicians of various nationalities and has incorporated a variety of exotic instruments to create music that has been called an eclectic fusion of ethnic sounds. Influenced by his encounters with cultures around the world, Yanni has been called a \"true global artist\" and his music is said to reflect his \"one world, one people\" philosophy.",
