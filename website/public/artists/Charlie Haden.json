  "name": "Charlie Haden",
  "description": "'''Charles Edward Haden''' (August 6, 1937&nbsp;â€“ July 11, 2014) was an American [[jazz]] [[double bass]] player, bandleader, composer and educator whose career spanned more than fifty years. Haden helped to revolutionize the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz, evolving a style that sometimes complemented the soloist, and other times moved independently, liberating bassists from a strictly accompanying role.\n\nIn the late 1950s, he was an original member of the ground-breaking [[Ornette Coleman]] Quartet. In 1969, he formed his first band, the ''Liberation Music Orchestra'', featuring arrangements by pianist [[Carla Bley]]. In the late 1960s, he became a member of pianist [[Keith Jarrett]]'s trio, quartet and quintet. In the 1980s, he formed his own band, ''Quartet West''. Haden also often recorded and performed in a duo setting, with musicians including guitarist [[Pat Metheny]] and pianists [[Hank Jones]] and [[Kenny Barron]].\n\nGerman [[musicologist]] [[Joachim-Ernst Berendt]] wrote that Haden's \"ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Ornette Coleman's [[free jazz]] solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. His virtuosity lies (...) in an incredible ability to make the [[double bass]] 'sound out'. Haden cultivated the instrument's gravity as no one else in jazz. He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve.\"",
