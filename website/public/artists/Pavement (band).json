  "description": "'''Pavement''' is an American [[indie rock]] band that formed in [[Stockton, California]] in 1989. For most of their career, the group consisted of [[Stephen Malkmus]] (vocals and guitar), [[Scott Kannberg]] (guitar and vocals), [[Mark Ibold]] (bass), [[Steve West (musician)|Steve West]] (drums), and [[Bob Nastanovich]] (percussion, synthesizers and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and ten EPs over the course of a decade, though the group disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, Pavement undertook a well-received reunion tour, followed by another international tour from 2022 to 2024.\n\nThough only briefly attracting mainstream attention with the single \"[[Cut Your Hair]]\" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major [[Record label|label]] as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to [[Independent record label|independent labels]] throughout their career, including [[Flying Nun Records|Flying Nun]] and [[Matador Records|Matador]]. Pavement has often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the 1990s. Some prominent music critics, such as [[Robert Christgau]] and [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], called them the best band of the 1990s. Pavement has achieved a [[cult following]].",
