His music forms a large part of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Berlin received numerous honors including an [[Academy Award]], a [[Grammy Award]], and a [[Tony Award]]. He also received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[Gerald R. Ford]] in 1977. Broadcast journalist [[Walter Cronkite]] stated he \"helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives\".\n\nBorn in [[Imperial Russia]], Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. His family left Russia to escape pogroms, one of which destroyed their village. He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights, and became known as the composer of numerous international hits, starting with 1911's \"[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]\". He also was an owner of the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  For much of his career, Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp; he used his custom piano equipped with a [[transposing piano|transposing lever]] when he needed to play in keys other than F-sharp. He was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to \"reach the heart of the average American\", who he saw as the \"real soul of the country\".\n\nHe wrote hundreds of songs, many becoming major hits, which made him famous before he turned thirty. During his 60-year career he wrote an estimated 1,500 songs, including the scores for 20 original Broadway shows and 15 original [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]] films, with his songs nominated eight times for [[Academy Awards]]. Many songs became popular themes and anthems, including \"[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]\", \"[[Blue Skies (Irving Berlin song)|Blue Skies]]\", \"[[Easter Parade (song)|Easter Parade]]\", \"[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]\", \"[[Cheek to Cheek]]\", \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\", \"[[Happy Holiday (song)|Happy Holiday]]\", \"[[Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)]]\", and \"[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]\". \nHis Broadway musical ''[[This Is The Army (musical)|This Is the Army]]'' (1942) was adapted into the [[This Is the Army|1943 film of the same name]].\n\nBerlin's songs have reached the top of the US charts 25 times and have been extensively re-recorded by numerous singers. Berlin died in 1989 at [[centenarian|the age of 101]]. Composer [[Douglas Moore]] sets Berlin apart from all other contemporary songwriters, and includes him instead with [[Stephen Foster]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Carl Sandburg]], as a \"great American minstrel\"—someone who has \"caught and immortalized in his songs what we say, what we think about, and what we believe.\"  Composer [[George Gershwin]] called him \"the greatest songwriter that has ever lived\",{{rp|117}} and composer [[Jerome Kern]] concluded that \"Irving Berlin has no ''place'' in American music—he ''is'' American music.\"",
