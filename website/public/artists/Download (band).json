The initial lineup also included, Off & Gone's [[Phil Western]] and [[Mark Spybey]] of [[Dead Voices on Air]], but has since been particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members following [[Dwayne Goettel|Goettel]]'s death.  Download's music has been described as [[post-industrial music|post-industrial]], drawing from the band's genesis as part of [[Skinny Puppy]] but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Autechre]].  The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of [[synthesizer]]s and [[Sampling (music)|sample]]d [[musical instrument|instrument]]s; the music is particularly centered on the elements of [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[rhythm]].\n\nOther artists that have been involved are [[Genesis P. Orridge]], Anthony Valcic, Bill Van Rooy, and Ken Marshall. Earlier releases frequently included [[vocal]] elements and [[lyrics]], but since [[III (Download album)|III]] (and Mark Spybey's departure in 1996) their work has been strictly instrumental.",
