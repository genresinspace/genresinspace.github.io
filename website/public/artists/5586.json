  "description": "'''Fishbone''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California. Formed in 1979, the band plays a fusion of [[ska music|ska]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[funk music|funk]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[reggae music|reggae]], and [[Soul music|soul]]. [[AllMusic]] has described the group as \"one of the most distinctive and eclectic [[alternative rock]] bands of the late 1980s. With their hyperactive, self-conscious [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], goofy sense of humor, and sharp [[social commentary]], the group gained a sizable [[cult following]]\".\n\nFishbone first assembled as school students in 1979 with John Norwood Fisher (bass), his brother Philip \"Fish\" Fisher (drums), [[Angelo Moore]] (vocals, saxophones, [[theremin]]), Kendall Jones (guitar), \"Dirty\" Walter A. Kibby II (vocals, trumpet), and Christopher Dowd (keyboards, trombone, vocals). They achieved their greatest commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after which they went through many personnel changes. From 2003 to 2010, John Norwood Fisher and Angelo Moore were the last remaining original members of the band. In the 2010s, all the other original members except Kendall Jones rejoined the band for various reunion tours and anniversary activities. As of March 2025, the lineup consists of Moore, Dowd, guitarist Tracey \"Spacey T\" Singleton, drummer Hassan Hurd, trumpeter JS Williams, and bassist James Jones.",
