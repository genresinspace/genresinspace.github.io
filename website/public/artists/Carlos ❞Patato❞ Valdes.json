  "description": "'''Carlos Valdés Galán''' (November 4, 1926 &ndash; December 4, 2007), better known as '''Patato''', was a Cuban [[conga]] player. In 1954, he emigrated from [[La Habana]] to [[New York City]] where he continued his prolific career as a sideman for several [[jazz]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] ensembles, and occasionally as a bandleader. He contributed to the development of the tunable conga drum which revolutionized the use of the instrument in the US. His experimental [[descarga]] albums recorded for [[Latin Percussion]] are considered the counterpart to the commercial [[salsa music|salsa]] boom of the 1970s.
