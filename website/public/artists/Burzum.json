  "description": "'''Burzum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|z|əm}}; {{IPA|no|ˈbʉ̀rtsʉm|lang}}) is a Norwegian music project founded by former [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] member [[Varg Vikernes]] in 1991. Although Burzum never played live performances, it became a staple of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] and is considered one of the most influential acts in [[black metal]]'s history. The word \"burzum\" means \"darkness\" in the [[Black Speech]], a [[fictional language]] crafted by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Burzum's lyrics and imagery are often inspired by fantasy and [[Norse mythology]]. \n\nVikernes founded Burzum in 1991 and recorded the first four Burzum albums between January 1992 and March 1993. From 1994 to 2009, Vikernes was imprisoned for the murder of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth]] and the arson of eight churches. While imprisoned, he recorded two [[dark ambient]] albums using only [[synthesizer]]s, as he had no access to drums, guitar, or bass. \n\nSince his release from prison in 2009, he has recorded several more albums, including those in the dark ambient and [[neofolk]] genres. Vikernes ended the Burzum project in 2020 before announcing a new album in 2024.",
