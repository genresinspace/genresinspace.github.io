  "description": "'''Therion''' (formerly '''Blitzkrieg''') is a Swedish [[symphonic metal]] band founded by [[Christofer Johnsson]] in 1987. Its name was inspired by the [[Celtic Frost]] album ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]''. \"To Mega Therion\" is Greek for \"The Great Beast\" and was a title used by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. Originally a [[death metal]] band, Therion adjusted its musical style by adding orchestral elements, including [[choir]]s, [[European classical music|classical musicians]], and even a full orchestra at their concert performances. As a result, they are considered pioneers of the [[symphonic metal]] genre.\n\nTherion takes its themes for the lyrics from different [[Mythology|mythologies]] and practices, including [[occult]]ism, [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and ancient traditions and writings.",
