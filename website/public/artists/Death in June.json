  "description": "'''Death in June''' are a [[neofolk]] group led by English musician [[Douglas P.]] (Douglas Pearce). The band was originally formed in the United Kingdom in 1981 as a trio. However, after the other members left, in 1984 and 1985, to work on other projects, the group became the work of Douglas P. and various collaborators. Over the band's four decades of existence, they have undergone numerous shifts in style and presentation, resulting in an overall shift from initial [[post-punk]] and [[industrial music]] influence to a more acoustic and folk musicâ€“oriented approach. Douglas P.'s influence was instrumental in originating neofolk music, of which his music has subsequently become a part.",
