  "description": "'''Pee Froiss''' is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group formed in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1993. It was originally a dance group which refocused on rap. Early on, Pee Froiss received mentorship from the Senegalese rap luminaries [[Positive Black Soul]], which produced their first album ''Wala Wala Bok?'' in 1996. The band's music is rapped in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]] and features traditional Senegalese instruments such as the [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] as part of its instrumentation. Pee Froiss was one of the first rap groups to include a female performer in their lineup, Sistah Joyce. The group created all of their own [[music video]]s with very sparse resources, the first of which was released with their first album. ''Wala Wala Bok?'' is considered a classic of Senegalese hip hop. Alongside, Positive Black Soul and Daara J, Pee Froiss emerged as trailblazers in Senegalese hip hop, galvanizing a generation by intertwining the genre with themes of political resistance and social activism.\n\nThough the group released successful albums on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] solely in Senegal and appeared on several European compilations, the first release to be sold internationally was their album ''Konk√©rants'' in 2003.",
