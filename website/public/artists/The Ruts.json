  "description": "'''The Ruts''' (later known as '''The Ruts D.C.''') are an English [[reggae]]-influenced [[punk rock]] band, notable for the 1979 UK [[Top 40|top 10]] [[hit record|hit]] single \"[[Babylon's Burning]]\", and an earlier single \"In a Rut\", which was not a hit but was highly regarded and regularly played by [[BBC Radio 1]] disc jockey [[John Peel]]. The band's newfound success was cut short by the death of lead singer Malcolm Owen from a [[Opioid overdose|heroin overdose]] in 1980. Despite this, the band continued under a different musical style as Ruts D.C. until 1983, when they disbanded.\n\nThe band reformed in 2007, shortly before their original guitarist Paul Fox died of cancer the same year. The Ruts D.C. currently consists of the band's original bassist and drummer, John \"Segs\" Jennings and David Ruffy, with a new guitarist, Leigh Heggarty.",
