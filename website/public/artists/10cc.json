  "description": "'''10cc''' are  an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Stockport]], southeast of [[Manchester]], in 1972. The group initially consisted of four musicians, [[Graham Gouldman]], [[Eric Stewart]], [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]], who had written and recorded together since 1968. The four members contributed to songwriting, working together in various permutations. Godley and Cremeâ€™s songwriting has been said to be inspired by [[Art pop|art]] and cinema. The four members were multi-instrumentalists, singers, writers and producers. Most of the band's records were recorded at their own [[Strawberry Studios]] (North) in Stockport and Strawberry Studios (South) in [[Dorking]], with most of those engineered by Stewart.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1978, 10cc had five consecutive UK top-ten albums: ''[[Sheet Music (10cc album)|Sheet Music]]'' (1974), ''[[The Original Soundtrack]]'' (1975), ''[[How Dare You! (album)|How Dare You!]]'' (1976), ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' (1977), and ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'' (1978). 10cc also had twelve singles reach the UK Top 40, three of which were the chart-toppers \"[[Rubber Bullets]]\" (1973), \"[[I'm Not in Love]]\" (1975), and \"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\" (1978). \"I'm Not in Love\" was their breakthrough worldwide hit, and is known for its innovative backing track. \n\nIn 1976, Godley and Creme quit the band to concentrate on developing an electronic music device, \"[[The Gizmo]]\", and being in video production and music as [[Godley & Creme]]. Stewart left the band in 1995. Since 1999, Gouldman has led a touring version of 10cc.",
