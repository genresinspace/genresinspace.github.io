  "description": "'''Sally''' \"'''Petula'''\" '''Clark''' (born 15 November 1932) is a British singer, actress, and songwriter. She started her professional career as a [[child actor|child performer]] and has had the longest career of any British entertainer, spanning more than 85 years.\n\nClark's professional career began during the [[Second World War]] as a child entertainer on [[BBC Radio]]. In 1954, she charted with \"[[The Little Shoemaker]]\", the first of her big UK hits, and within two years she began recording in French. Her international successes have included \"[[(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I|''Prends mon c≈ìur'']]\", \"[[Sailor (song)|Sailor]]\" (a UK number one), \"[[Romeo (Petula Clark song)|Romeo]]\", and \"[[I Will Follow Him|Chariot]]\". Hits in German, Italian and Spanish followed. \n\nIn late 1964, Clark's success extended to the United States with a five-year run of career-defining, often upbeat singles, many written or co-written by [[Tony Hatch]] and [[Jackie Trent]]. These include her signature song \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\" (US number one), \"[[I Know a Place]]\", \"[[My Love (Petula Clark song)|My Love]]\" (US number one), \"[[Sign of the Times (Petula Clark song)|A Sign of the Times]]\", \"[[I Couldn't Live Without Your Love]]\", \"[[Who Am I? (Petula Clark song)|Who Am I]]\", \"[[Colour My World (Petula Clark song)|Colour My World]]\", \"[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]\" (by [[Charlie Chaplin]]; a UK number one), \"[[Don't Sleep in the Subway]]\" and \"[[Kiss Me Goodbye (Petula Clark song)|Kiss Me Goodbye]]\". Between January 1965 and April 1968, Clark charted with nine US top 20 hits in the US, where she was called \"the First Lady of the [[British Invasion]]\". Her international chart success was unequalled in recording history. In 1968 she was the recipient of the MIDEM international award for the highest worldwide sales by a female artist. This followed on from her 1967 MIDEM award for most sales in Europe by a European artist. \n\nIt is estimated that Clark has sold between 70 and 100 million records. She also enjoyed success in the musical film ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'', for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a musical, and in the stage musicals ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' and ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'', for which she received BAFTA nominations. Clark along with David Cassidy rescued Blood Brothers from failure in her Broadway debut.",
