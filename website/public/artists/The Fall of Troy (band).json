Ward once again left the band in 2016, and was later replaced by Just Like Vinyl bassist Jon-Henry \"Hendo\" Batts.\nThe trio is known for their technical and dynamic style, unorthodox song structures, energetic stage presence and also for their song \"F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X.\" which was featured in several video games. The group has released six full-length albums, two [[Extended play|EPs]], and two singles.
