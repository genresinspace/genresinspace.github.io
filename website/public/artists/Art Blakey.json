  "description": "'''Arthur Blakey''' (October 11, 1919 â€“ October 16, 1990) was an American [[jazz]] drummer and bandleader. He was also known as '''Abdullah Ibn Buhaina''' after he converted to [[Islam]] for a short time in the late 1940s.\n\nBlakey made a name for himself in the 1940s in the big bands of [[Fletcher Henderson]] and [[Billy Eckstine]]. He then worked with bebop musicians [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. In the mid-1950s, [[Horace Silver]] and Blakey formed [[The Jazz Messengers]], a group which he led for the next 35 years. The group was formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Benny Golson]], [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Donald Byrd]], [[Jackie McLean]], [[Johnny Griffin]], [[Curtis Fuller]], [[Chuck Mangione]], [[Chick Corea]], [[Keith Jarrett]], [[Cedar Walton]], [[Woody Shaw]], [[Terence Blanchard]], and [[Wynton Marsalis]]. ''The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz'' calls the Jazz Messengers \"the archetypal [[hard bop]] group of the late 50s.\"\n\nBlakey was inducted into the [[Down Beat]] [[Down Beat#Hall of Fame|Jazz Hall of Fame]] (in 1981). Posthumously, he was inducted into the ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' Hall of Fame in 1991 and the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] (in 1998 and 2001). He was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2005.",
