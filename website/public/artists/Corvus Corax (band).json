  "description": "'''Corvus Corax''' is a German band known for playing [[Medieval metal ]] using [[historically informed performance|authentic]] instruments. Their name is the [[Latin]] name for the [[common raven]]. The band was formed in 1989 by Castus Rabensang, Wim (Venustus) and Meister Selbfried (\"Master Selfpeace\") in East Germany. The band often uses [[bagpipe]]s as the solo instrument; their live performances attract attention with the bizarre look of the musicians being reminiscent of ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]]: half-naked, dressed in unusual clothes, wearing primitive tribal decorations, often tattooed.\n\nToday the band consists of seven members: Castus Rabensang (\"Castus Ravensong\"), Xandru, Norri (formerly known as Harmann der Drescher), Hatz (\"Hunt\"), Vit and Victorius. In May 2005 Meister Selbfried, one of the Corvus Corax founders and the researcher of medieval music, decided to cease his active musicianship and to dedicate himself mostly to managing Corvus Corax's own label Pica Records. His place in the line-up was taken by Jordon Finus in 2006.\n\nThe band releases its music through Pica Records in Europe and Noir Records in the US. The Cantus Buranus projects have thus far been released in Europe by Roadrunner Europe.",
