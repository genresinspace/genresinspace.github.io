  "description": "'''José Ribamar Coelho Santos''' (born 11 April 1966), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Zeca Baleiro''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈzɛkɐ baˈlejɾu}}), is a Brazilian [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] artist. One of his most famous songs is \"Salão de Beleza\", which was featured on [[Putumayo World Music]]'s ''Reggae Around the World'' compilation. Along with being a solo artist, he has also worked with guitarist [[Pedro Joia]].\n\nHailing from the state of [[Maranhão]], in northeastern Brazil, Zeca – short for José – grew up with music. He then went to a university to study Agronomy and was given the nickname \"Baleiro\" (\"candyman\"), because of his love for candy.\n\nHis first two records, ''Por Onde Andará Stephen Fry'' and ''Vô Imbolá'', won gold status. The title track on ''Por Onde Andará Stephen Fry?'' (Where could Stephen Fry be?) was a reference to [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Stephen Fry]]'s flight from the stage play ''[[Cell Mates (play)|Cell Mates]]'' in 1995, when he disappeared from the United Kingdom after bad reviews. Zeca won the 2000 Latin [[Grammy]]s for \"best pop album\". In 2014, his live album ''Calma Aí, Coração - Ao Vivo'' was nominated for the same award, but in the [[Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album|Best Música Popular Brasileira Album category]], with the title song being nominated for the [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Brazilian Song|Best Brazilian Song category]]. He currently resides in [[São Paulo]]. In [[20th Annual Latin Grammy Awards|2019]], he received another Latin Grammy nomination for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best MPB Album|Best MPB Album]], this time for ''[[O Amor no Caos]]''.
