  "description": "'''D12''' (an [[initialism]] for '''the Dirty Dozen''') is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group from [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Formed in 1996, the group achieved mainstream success with its lineup of ''de facto'' leader [[Eminem]], [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]], [[Denaun Porter|Kon Artis]], Kuniva and Swifty McVay.\n\nD12 had chart-topping albums in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia during the early 2000s. The group released the albums ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' in 2001 and ''[[D12 World]]'' in 2004, spawning numerous hits such as \"[[Shit on You]]\", \"[[Purple Pills]]\", \"[[Fight Music]]\", \"[[My Band]]\" and \"[[How Come (D12 song)|How Come]]\" throughout that period. Both albums were certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nIn 2004, the group won the [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Hip-Hop|Best Hip-Hop Act]].\n\nSince 2006, Eminem's hiatus and the death of Proof resulted in the group being less active in subsequent years. Between 2008 and 2015, D12 released three official mixtapes with the core lineup reduced to Bizarre, Kuniva and Swifty McVay, with isolated token appearances by Eminem and some contributions from Mr. Porter (formerly Kon Artis) and returning '90s affiliate Fuzz Scoota.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, Eminem released his tenth studio album ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]'', containing a song titled \"[[Stepping Stone (Eminem song)|Stepping Stone]]\", on which he declared that 'D12 is over,' indicating his formal retirement from the group after many years of inactive membership. Bizarre, Kuniva and Swifty have continued to tour and record as D12.",
