  "description": "'''Jornt Elzinga''' (born 1989), commonly known as {{Nihongo|'''Cat System Corp.'''|猫 シ Corp.|Neko Shi Corp.|lead=yes}}, is a Dutch musician regarded as a [[vaporwave]] figure that originated the [[mallsoft]] subgenre. He also previously recorded as '''Mesektet''' for his [[dark ambient]] releases.\n\nBorn in 1989, Elzinga started his music career in the 2000s with [[drone music|drone]] and [[noise music|noise]] productions. He began his independent vaporwave career in 2013, and became popular in the scene with his 2014 album ''Hiraeth''. His solo works, including albums such as ''[[Palm Mall]]'' (2014), ''Cosmopolitan Dreams'' (2016), and ''[[News at 11 (album)|News at 11]]'' (2016), are known for popularising mallsoft. His collaborations with other musicians also spawned successful albums within the community, including ''Corporate Mixtape'' (2014) and ''Building a Better World'' (2019).\n\nElzinga's music explores concepts of late 20th century [[capitalism]], presenting ambient shopping center recordings characteristic of mallsoft. It also portrays specific events, such as an alternate history where the [[September 11 attacks]] never happened, or a fictional soundtrack to a retro fashion TV series. In 2019, he founded his own record label, Hiraeth Records. He is one of the best-selling mallsoft artists as of 2022.",
