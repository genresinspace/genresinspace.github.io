  "description": "'''Clifford Joseph Harris Jr.''' (born September 25, 1980), known professionally as '''T.I.''' or '''Tip''', is an American rapper and songwriter. Born and raised in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, Harris is credited as a pioneer of the hip hop subgenre [[trap music]], along with fellow Georgia-based rappers [[Jeezy]] and [[Gucci Mane]]. He first became acquainted with local music executive [[Kawan Prather|Kawan \"KP\" Prather]], and joined his company Ghet-O-Vision Entertainment by the late 1990s. He was led to sign a [[Music industry#Record labels|major-label]] record deal with its parent company [[LaFace Records]], an imprint of [[Arista Records]] in 1999. His debut studio album, ''[[I'm Serious]]'' (2001), was met with lukewarm critical and commercial reception, becoming his only release with the label. He then signed with [[Atlantic Records]], where he soon reached his mainstream breakthrough and co-founded his own label imprint, [[Grand Hustle Records]] by 2003.\n\nHarris gained recognition following his high-profile guest appearance on fellow Atlanta-based rapper [[Bone Crusher (rapper)|Bone Crusher]]'s 2003 single \"[[Never Scared (song)|Never Scared]]\". His second album, ''[[Trap Muzik]]'' (2003), peaked at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top 40 singles \"[[Rubber Band Man]]\" and \"[[Let's Get Away]]\" (featuring [[Jazze Pha]]). The following year, Harris guest appeared alongside [[Lil Wayne]] on [[Destiny's Child]]'s hit single \"[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]\", and capitalized on this with the release of his third album, ''[[Urban Legend (album)|Urban Legend]]'' (2004). His next three studio albums each debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200; his fourth and fifth, ''[[King (T.I. album)|King]]'' (2006) and ''[[T.I. vs. T.I.P.]]'' (2007) were met with continued success and led by the ''Billboard'' Hot 100-top ten singles, \"[[What You Know (T.I. song)|What You Know]]\" and \"[[Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)]]\", respectively.\n\nHarris' sixth album, ''[[Paper Trail]]'' (2008), yielded his greatest commercial success. Earning [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for 500,000 in first-week sales, it also spawned two ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one singles: \"[[Whatever You Like]]\" and \"[[Live Your Life (T.I. song)|Live Your Life]]\" (featuring [[Rihanna]]); the latter replaced the former atop the chart, and made Harris the first rapper to do so while occupying its top two positions. Following an eleven-month [[incarceration]], he released his seventh studio album, ''[[No Mercy (T.I. album)|No Mercy]]'' (2010) to mixed reviews and a commercial decline. His eighth album, ''[[Trouble Man: Heavy Is the Head]]'' (2012) was met with a dual rebound. Harris guest appeared alongside [[Pharrell Williams]] on [[Robin Thicke]]'s 2013 single \"[[Blurred Lines]]\", which peaked atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and did so in 22 other countries.\n\nThe following year, his contract with Atlantic expired; he signed with [[Columbia Records]] and enlisted Williams as [[executive producer]] for his ninth studio album, ''[[Paperwork (T.I. album)|Paperwork]]'' (2014). As with his previous, it reached number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 and saw positive critical reception. The following year, he worked further with album collaborator and then-upcoming hometown native [[Young Thug]] to form the short-lived hip hop collective, [[Bankroll Mafia]]. He then signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] in 2016 to release his [[political hip hop|political]] ''[[Us or Else]]'' (2016–2017) extended play series and compilation album, ''[[We Want Smoke]]'' (2017); he later signed with [[Epic Records]] in 2018 to release his long-delayed tenth album, ''[[Dime Trap]]'', in October of that year. His eleventh album, ''[[The L.I.B.R.A.]]'' (2020) was his first to be released [[independent music|independently]]. His twelfth album, ''[[Kill the King (album)|Kill the King]]'' was announced as his final, although its release slate remains unclear.\n\nHarris, a three [[Grammy Award]] winner, has been described as a leading figure in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Southern hip hop]] during the 2000s. He has received 19 nominations for the award, as well as 12 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], three [[BET Awards]], and two [[American Music Awards]].
