  "name": "Rafael Escalona",
  "description": "'''Rafael Calixto Escalona Martinez''' (May 26, 1926 – May 13, 2009) was a Colombian composer and [[troubadour]]. He was known for being one of the most prominent [[vallenato]] music composers and troubadours of the genre and for being the co-founder of the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]], along with [[Consuelo Araújo]] and [[Alfonso López Michelsen]].\n\nHe was also a long-time friend of [[Gabriel García Márquez]], who included him in his stories and once told him that his own masterpiece novel, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', was just a 350-page [[Vallenato]]. Escalona's songs compile the history and stories of the [[Magdalena Department]] of the past 20th century. Escalona was an atypical music composer:  he does not play any instruments or sing so his songs can in some ways be difficult to analyze. His songs constitute a legacy of a past generation of Colombians in his memory, a pictorial collage, full of grace, that narrates stories, customs and gossips from his region. He also left a legacy of his loves and pains, humour and poetry. In 1991, [[Caracol TV]] produced a television series named ''[[Escalona (TV)|Escalona]]'', after him.",
