  "name": "Ava Cherry",
  "description": "'''Ava Cherry'''  is an American singer and model. She collaborated with English musician [[David Bowie]] between 1972 and 1975; the two met in [[New York City]] when she was a nightclub waitress and Bowie was touring for ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Afterwards, they began a period of personal and artistic collaboration that heavily influenced the ''[[Young Americans]]'' \"[[blue-eyed soul]]\" era. Following this, she struck out as a solo singer and backing artist for musicians such as [[Luther Vandross]] and [[Chaka Khan]].\n\nGrowing up in Chicago with significant exposure to the local African-American music culture, Cherry became an influence in the works of a number of pre-eminent artists, as well as a respected musician in her own right. Cherry's influence on ''Young Americans'' through her connections to major [[soul music]] institutions such as [[Sigma Sound Studios]] and the [[Apollo Theater]] has proven a particularly noted part of her legacy, as has her contemporaneous work with proto-[[new wave music|new wave]] band the Astronettes.\n\nCherry's solo career has been long-running, with her first album ''Ripe!!!'' released in 1980. Her solo work, known for its [[disco]] influence, has received a mostly positive critical reception but a lack of commercial success: factors blamed for this critical and commercial disconnect include racial discrimination within the music industry and backlash against her predominant genres.\n\nIn January 2022 she released her autobiography ''All That Glitters: The Ava Cherry Story''.",
