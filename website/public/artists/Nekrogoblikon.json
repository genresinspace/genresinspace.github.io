The group was formed in 2006 by Nicky Calonne and Tim Lyakhovetskiy. Lead guitarist Alex Alereza remains the member with the longest active tenure. Nekrogoblikon has released five full-length albums, ''Goblin Island'', ''Stench'', ''[[Heavy Meta (Nekrogoblikon album)|Heavy Meta]]'', ''Welcome to Bonkers'' and ''The Fundamental Slimes and Humours'', and one [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Power (Nekrogoblikon EP)|Power]]''.\n\nThe band became famous for its music video \"No One Survives\" (2012). It starred a fictional '''John Goblikon''', created by director [[Brandon Dermer]] and portrayed by actor-comedian Dave Rispoli, soon becoming the band's mascot and touring hypeman. In 2022, musician-comedian Grady Welch began portraying John Goblikon on tour, becoming the lead singer following Calonne's departure the next year. Welch is credited as Goblikon's \"vocal coach\" while Rispoli is credit as his \"writer\" in the band's lore. The character spawned a [[talk show]] [[web series]] ''Right Now with John Goblikon'' from 2015 to 2019 and 2021 to 2022, followed by a long-form [[podcast]] series of the same name in 2024.",
