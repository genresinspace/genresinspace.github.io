Due to his numerous pioneering achievements throughout Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, he is considered an icon amongst [[Shōwa era]] idols.\n\nWith on-stage vivacity and highly acclaimed vocals as his defining trademarks, Saijō quickly came to dominate the Japanese charts of the 1970s. He was consistently promoted as part of the {{nihongo3|\"New Big Three\"|新御三家|Shin-Gosanke}} idol trio alongside two other soloists who debuted around the same time: [[Goro Noguchi]] and [[Hiromi Go]]. Almost seven years into his career, his 28th single \"YOUNG MAN (Y.M.C.A.)\" (a Japanese cover of [[Y.M.C.A. (song)|the Village People song of the same name]]) became a social phenomenon in Japan, selling over 1.8 million copies.",
