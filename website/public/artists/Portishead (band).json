  "description": "'''Portishead''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɔr|t|ɪ|s|ˈ|h|ɛ|d}} {{respell|PORT|iss|HED}}) are an English [[Electronic music|electronic]] band formed in 1991 in [[Bristol]]. The band comprises [[Beth Gibbons]] (vocals), [[Geoff Barrow]] (multiple instruments, production), and [[Adrian Utley]] (guitar). Dave McDonald, an audio engineer who helped produce their first two albums, is sometimes regarded as the fourth member.\n\nPortishead's debut album, ''[[Dummy (album)|Dummy]]'' (1994), fused [[hip-hop]] production with an atmospheric style reminiscent of [[spy film]] soundtracks and yearning vocals from Gibbons. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, becoming a landmark album in the emerging [[trip-hop]] genre. However, the band disliked being associated with the term. Their two other studio albums, ''[[Portishead (album)|Portishead]]'' (1997) and ''[[Third (Portishead album)|Third]]'' (2008), received similar acclaim. Portishead have also released the live album ''[[Roseland NYC Live]]'' (1998).",
