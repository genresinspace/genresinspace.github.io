The band's use of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], [[odd time signatures]], [[polyrhythms]] and unconventional drum patterns became a staple of their sound, although later albums incorporated more melody, and influences from a range of genres.

The final lineup also included longtime members [[Liam Wilson]] on bass, [[Greg Puciato]] as lead vocalist, and [[Billy Rymer]] on drums, alongside then-newcomer Kevin Antreassian on rhythm guitar.\n\nThe Dillinger Escape Plan achieved critical success, releasing six studio albums during its existence, the first being ''[[Calculating Infinity]]'' (1999), which has been noted by critics as a landmark release in [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music]]. The album has achieved a cult status selling well over 100,000 copies, which made the band the highest-selling artist on [[Relapse Records|Relapse]] at the time. The Dillinger Escape Plan has won various nominations from award shows and publications such as the [[PLUG Independent Music Awards]], ''[[Kerrang!]]'', [[Revolver (magazine)|''Revolver'']] and ''[[Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards|Metal Hammer]]''. In 2017, the band won an [[Association of Independent Music|AIM]] Award for \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\".\n\nPrior to the release of their final album, ''[[Dissociation (album)|Dissociation]]'' (2016), The Dillinger Escape Plan announced that they would be disbanding at the end of the album's touring cycle. Their final shows took place at [[Terminal 5 (venue)|Terminal 5]] in New York City from December 27â€“29, 2017. In December 2023, the band announced that they were reuniting for three shows in New York in June 2024 with original frontman [[Dimitri Minakakis]] to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ''Calculating Infinity''.",
