  "description": "'''Anthony Braxton''' (born June 4, 1945) is an American [[Experimental music|experimental]] composer, educator, music [[music theory|theorist]], [[improviser]], and multi-instrumentalist who is best known for playing saxophones, particularly the [[alto saxophone|alto sax]]. He grew up on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] and was a key early member of the [[Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians]]. He received great acclaim for his 1969 [[Double album|double]]-[[Gramophone record|LP]] record ''[[For Alto]]'', the first full-length album of solo saxophone music.\n\nA prolific composer with a vast body of cross-genre work, the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]] and [[NEA Jazz Masters|NEA Jazz Master]] has released hundreds of recordings and compositions. During six years that he was signed to [[Arista Records]], the diversity of his output encompassed work with many members of the AACM including duets with co-founder and first president [[Muhal Richard Abrams]]; collaborations with electronic musician [[Richard Teitelbaum]]; a saxophone quartet with [[Julius Hemphill]], [[Oliver Lake]] and [[Hamiet Bluiett]]; compositions for four orchestras; and the ensemble arrangements of ''[[Creative Orchestra Music 1976]]'', which was named the 1977 ''[[DownBeat]]'' Critics' Poll Album of the Year. Many of Braxton's projects are ongoing including the ''Diamond Curtain Wall'' works, in which Braxton implements audio programming language [[SuperCollider]]; the ''Ghost Trance Music'' series, inspired by his studies of the Native American [[Ghost Dance]]; and ''Echo Echo Mirror House Music'', in which musicians \"play\" [[IPod|iPods]] containing the bulk of Braxton's oeuvre. He released the first six operas in a series called the ''[[Trillium (opera cycle)|Trillium]]'' Opera Complex.\n\nBraxton identifies as a \"trans-idiomatic\" composer and has repeatedly opposed the idea of a rigid dichotomy between improvisation and composition. He has written extensively about the \"language music\" system that forms the basis for his work and developed a philosophy of \"world creativity\" in his ''Tri-Axium Writings''.\n\nBraxton taught at [[Mills College at Northeastern University|Mills College]] in [[Oakland, California]] from 1985 to 1990 and was Professor of Music at [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]] from 1990 until his retirement at the end of 2013. He is the artistic director of Tri-Centric Foundation, a nonprofit he founded in 1994 to support the preservation and production of works by Braxton and other artists \"in pursuit of 'trans-idiomatic' creativity\".",
