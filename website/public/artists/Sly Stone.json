  "description": "'''Sylvester Stewart''' (March 15, 1943 â€“ June 9, 2025), better known by his stage name '''Sly Stone''', was an American musician, songwriter and record producer. He was the frontman of [[Sly and the Family Stone]], playing a critical role in the development of [[psychedelic soul]] and [[funk]] with his pioneering fusion of [[Soul music|soul]], [[rock music|rock]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[gospel music|gospel]] in the 1960s and 1970s. [[AllMusic]] stated that \"[[James Brown]] may have invented funk, but Sly Stone perfected it,\" and credited him with \"creating a series of euphoric yet politically charged records that proved a massive influence on artists of all musical and cultural backgrounds\". ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' has credited him as the founder of the \"[[progressive soul]]\" movement.\n\nBorn in [[Denton, Texas]], and raised in the Bay Area city of [[Vallejo, California|Vallejo]] in Northern California, Stone mastered several instruments at an early age and performed gospel music as a child with his siblings (and future bandmates) [[Freddie Stone|Freddie]] and [[Rose Stone|Rose]]. In the mid-1960s, he worked as both a record producer for [[Autumn Records]] and a disc jockey for San Francisco radio station [[KDIA]]. In 1966, Stone and his brother Freddie joined their bands together to form Sly and the Family Stone, a racially integrated, [[Mixed-gender band|mixed-gender]] act. The group would score hits including \"[[Dance to the Music (song)|Dance to the Music]]\" (1968), \"[[Everyday People]]\" (1968), \"[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]\" (1969), \"[[I Want to Take You Higher]]\" (1969), \"[[Family Affair (Sly and the Family Stone song)|Family Affair]]\" (1971), and \"[[If You Want Me to Stay]]\" (1973) and acclaimed albums including ''[[Stand!]]'' (1969), ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' (1971), and [[Fresh (Sly and the Family Stone album)|''Fresh'']] (1973).\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Stone's drug use and erratic behavior effectively ended the group, leaving him to record several unsuccessful solo albums. He toured or collaborated with artists such as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Bobby Womack]], and [[Jesse Johnson (musician)|Jesse Johnson]]. In 1993, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the group. He took part in a Sly and the Family Stone tribute at the [[2006 Grammy Awards]], his first live performance since 1987.\n\nStone released his autobiography, ''[[Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (book)|Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]]'', in 2023.",
