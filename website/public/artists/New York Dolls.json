Along with [[the Velvet Underground]], the [[MC5]], and [[the Stooges]], they were one of the first bands of the early [[punk rock]] scenes. Although the band never achieved much commercial success and their original line-up fell apart quickly, the band's first two albums—''[[New York Dolls (album)|New York Dolls]]'' (1973) and ''[[Too Much Too Soon (album)|Too Much Too Soon]]'' (1974)—became among the most popular [[cult following|cult]] records in rock. The line-up at this time consisted of vocalist [[David Johansen]], guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]], bassist [[Arthur Kane]], guitarist and pianist [[Sylvain Sylvain]], and drummer [[Jerry Nolan]]; the latter two had replaced [[Rick Rivets]] and [[Billy Murcia]], respectively, in 1972. On stage, they donned an androgynous wardrobe, wearing high heels, eccentric hats, satin, makeup, spandex, and dresses.{{sfn|Ward|Stokes|Tucker|1986|p=549}} Nolan described the group in 1974 as \"the [[Dead End Kids]] of today\".\n\nAfter reuniting, they recruited new musicians to tour and record. They released three more albums—''[[One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This]]'' (2006), ''[[Cause I Sez So]]'' (2009) and ''[[Dancing Backward in High Heels]]'' (2011). Following a 2011 British tour with [[Alice Cooper]], the Dolls disbanded again. Johansen, the last surviving original member of the band, died in 2025.",
