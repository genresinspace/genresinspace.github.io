  "description": "'''New York Dolls''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in New York City in 1971, who released two albums, ''[[New York Dolls (album)|New York Dolls]]'' (1973) and ''[[Too Much Too Soon (album)|Too Much Too Soon]]'' (1974), before disbanding in 1976. Its classic lineup consisted of vocalist [[David Johansen]], guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]], bassist [[Arthur Kane]], guitarist and pianist [[Sylvain Sylvain]], and drummer [[Jerry Nolan]]; the latter two had replaced [[Rick Rivets]] and [[Billy Murcia]], respectively, in 1972. In their appearance, they drew from [[Drag queen|drag fashion]], wearing high heels, hats, satin, makeup, spandex, and dresses.{{sfn|Ward|Stokes|Tucker|1986|p=549}}\n\nIn 2004, the New York Dolls reunited with a new lineup and later released three more albums. After a British tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 2011, the Dolls disbanded again. By 2025, all original members of the New York Dolls had died: drummer [[Billy Murcia]] (1951–1972), guitarist [[Johnny Thunders]] (1952–1991), drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] (1946-1992), bassist [[Arthur Kane]] (1949–2004), guitarist [[Sylvain Sylvain]] (1951–2021), and lead singer [[David Johansen]] (1950–2025).\n\nTheir music and stage presence played a key role in the development of [[punk rock]] and later [[glam punk]], with their look inspiring the androgynous appearances of several [[glam metal]] bands in the 1980s.\nThey have been cited as an influence by notable artists such as [[Morrissey]] of [[the Smiths]], the [[Sex Pistols]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[the Undertones]], [[Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]], [[David Bowie]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]],  [[Billy Idol]], [[Terry Chambers]] of [[XTC]], [[Def Leppard]], [[R.E.M.]], [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Soundgarden]],  [[Marilyn Manson]], [[the Cramps]], [[the Libertines]] and the [[Manic Street Preachers]].",
