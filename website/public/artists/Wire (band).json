  "description": "'''Wire''' are a British rock band, formed in London in October 1976 by [[Colin Newman]] (vocals, guitar), [[Graham Lewis]] (bass, vocals), [[Bruce Gilbert]] (guitar), George Gill (lead guitar) and [[Robert Grey (musician)|Robert Grey]] (aka Robert Gotobed; drums). They were originally associated with the [[punk rock]] scene, appearing on ''[[The Roxy London WC2]]'' album, and were instrumental to the development of [[post-punk]], while their debut album, ''[[Pink Flag]]'', was influential for [[hardcore punk]].\n\nWire are considered a definitive and highly influential [[art punk]] and post-punk band, due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound and obscure lyrical themes.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} They steadily developed from an early [[noise rock]] style to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and synthesizers (1978's ''[[Chairs Missing]]'' and 1979's ''[[154 (album)|154]]''). The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout their career.",
