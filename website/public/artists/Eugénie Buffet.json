She has been called one of the first, if not ''the'' first, performer of the ''[[chanson réaliste]]'' (realist song) genre. She became a national sensation in France, performing in the fashionable ''[[cafés-concerts]]'' of Paris as well as embarking on both national and international tours. Her biggest success is said to be her performance of the song \"''La Sérénade du Pavé''\" (Sidewalk Serenade), written by Jean Varney in 1895. She was also known to perform in the street for charity in the poorer areas of Paris – work for which she was awarded the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''.",
