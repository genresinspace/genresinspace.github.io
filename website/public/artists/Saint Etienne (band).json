  "description": "'''Saint Etienne''' ({{IPAc-en|s|eɪ|n|_|ɛ|t|i|ˈ|ɛ|n}} {{respell|SEIN|_|eh|TEE|en}}) are an English band from [[Greater London]], formed in 1990. The band consists of [[Sarah Cracknell]], [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] and [[Pete Wiggs]]. Commonly associated with the [[Alternative dance|indie dance]] scene of the 1990s, their music blends [[Clubbing (subculture)|club culture]] with [[1960s in music|1960s pop]] and other disparate influences.\n\nTheir debut album, ''[[Foxbase Alpha]]'', was released to critical acclaim in 1991, featuring their most enduring hits \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[Nothing Can Stop Us (song)|Nothing Can Stop Us]]\". It was followed by ''[[So Tough]]'' (1993), with the number twelve single \"[[You're in a Bad Way]]\", and the [[techno]] [[Folk music|folk]] experiment of ''[[Tiger Bay (album)|Tiger Bay]]'' (1994); both albums reached the top-ten. Their early period was rounded out by the [[British Phonographic Industry|gold-certified]] compilation ''[[Too Young to Die: Singles 1990–1995]]'', producing the band's highest-charting single, \"[[He's on the Phone]]\" with [[Étienne Daho]].\n\nThe band embraced [[indie pop]] on ''[[Good Humor (album)|Good Humor]]'' (1998), with its lead single \"[[Sylvie (song)|Sylvie]]\" reaching number twelve. By the new millennium, Saint Etienne had pivoted towards [[ambient music]] on ''[[Sound of Water]]'' (2000), while ''[[Finisterre (album)|Finisterre]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tales from Turnpike House]]'' (2005) distilled these stylistic diversions and a return to their early influences. The 2010s, with ''[[Words and Music by Saint Etienne|Words and Music]]'' (2012) and ''[[Home Counties (album)|Home Counties]]'' (2017), saw a contemporary update of their sound. The band incorporated [[Sampling (music)|samples]] for the first time in nearly two decades on ''[[I've Been Trying to Tell You]]'' (2021), which became their highest-charting album since 1994 at number fourteen.\n\nThe band's name comes from the French football club [[AS Saint-Étienne]].",
