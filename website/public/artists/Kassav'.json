  "description": "'''Kassav'''', also alternatively spelled '''Kassav''', is a [[French West Indies|French Caribbean]] band that originated from [[Guadeloupe]] in 1979. The band's musical style is rooted in the Guadeloupean [[Gwo ka|gwoka rhythm]], as well as the [[Martinique|Martinican]] [[tibwa]] and Mendé rhythms. Regarded as one of the most influential bands in 20th-century [[Music of the Lesser Antilles|French West Indies music]], Kassav is often credited with pioneering the [[zouk]] musical genre. Their musical evolution is a [[Synthesizer|synthesis]] of [[cadence-lypso]] and [[compas]] traditions.\n\nDespite initial resistance from French record labels, which disparaged their early works as excessively \"too ethnic,\" Kassav' tenaciously persevered, collaborating with various West Indian music producers and distributing their music through [[Sonodisc]]. The term \"kassav\" in [[Creole language|creole]] denotes a type of [[cassava]] pancake. The band's inception can be traced to Pierre-Edouard Décimus and Fréddy Marshall, members of the Guadeloupean ensemble Les Vikings, who aspired to innovate the island's traditional music by amalgamating it with contemporary influences.\n\nThe integration of Georges Décimus, brother of Pierre-Edouard Décimus, and Jacob Desvarieux, a guitarist and arranger, significantly contributed to the band's gradual formation, with additional musicians subsequently joining Kassav'. Their debut studio album, ''Love and Kadance'', released in 1979, heralded the advent of zouk and served as the archetypical exemplar for the genre.\n\nWith a discography of over 50 albums, encompassing both band and solo projects from its members, Kassav' has achieved significant international recognition. They were the first black group to perform in the [[Soviet Union]].",
