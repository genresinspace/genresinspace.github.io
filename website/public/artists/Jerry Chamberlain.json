  "description": "'''Jerry Chamberlain''' is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer, best known for his work with the rock bands [[Daniel Amos]] and [[the Swirling Eddies]] (credited as \"Spot\").\n\nIn late 1974, Chamberlain was asked to join Jubal's Last Band, a band that consisted of [[Terry Scott Taylor]], [[Steve Baxter (musician)|Steve Baxter]] and bassist Kenny Paxton. [[Marty Dieckmeyer]] was soon brought in as a replacement for the departing Paxton. Sometime in the middle of 1975, Jubal's Last Band or Jubal (as a shortened form of the name was briefly used) auditioned for [[Maranatha! Music]] and [[Calvary Chapel]] (without Baxter, who couldn't get off work) in hopes of signing a recording and performance contract. At a Maranatha Music meeting, another band led by [[Darrell Mansfield]], was\nalso using the name, Jubal. The two bands decided to change their names to avoid confusion. Mansfield renamed his band ''[[Gentle Faith]]'', and Jubal's Last Band/Jubal became [[Daniel Amos]].\n\nDaniel Amos succeeded in landing a recording and performance contract, and quickly recorded their first song for the label, Taylor's \"Ain't Gonna Fight It\" for the Maranatha 5 compilation. A full album, produced by [[Al Perkins]], followed. Chamberlain quickly became an important part in the sound of D.A. In the band's early days of country/rock, Chamberlain would often launch into a rock and roll guitar solo inappropriately in the middle of \"Happily Married Man.\" In the later years, his guitar playing drove songs like \"Endless Summer\" and \"I Love You #19\".\n\nAlthough Chamberlain left DA in late 1983, he did return on a few later albums including ''[[MotorCycle]]'' (1993) (which he co-produced), ''[[BibleLand]]'' (1994) and ''[[Songs of the Heart]]'' (1995).\n\nIn 2001, Chamberlain and Sharon McCall recorded a song (\"Message from the Country\") with pop rocker Doug Powell, drummer Ken Coomer ([[Wilco (rock band)|Wilco]], [[Uncle Tupelo]]) and session musician Jonathan Yudkin for the [[Jeff Lynne]] tribute ''Lynne Me Your Ears'' (2002) under the moniker, The Balls of France.\n\nThe years 2004â€“2005 saw Chamberlain and McCall join forces with friends to form an all-[[British Invasion]] outfit called The Pickled Beats. The band continues, with slight lineup changes, to play the occasional live performance.\n\nIn 2006, Chamberlain once again joined forces with Terry Taylor by lending a hand on the [[Lost Dogs]] album ''[[The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees]]''. Chamberlain also returned to his [[Swirling Eddies]] pseudonym \"Spot,\" for the 2007 release ''[[The midget, the speck and the molecule]].''\n\nAfter meeting and doing gigs together over 30 years ago in California, Chamberlain and [[Pam Mark Hall]] joined forces as the duo, Pamelita and Parker, in late 2008.",
