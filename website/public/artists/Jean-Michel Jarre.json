  "description": "'''Jean-Michel André Jarre'''{{noteTag|\"Jean-Michel\" is a single name, rather than two separate ones, although in certain cases it is written without the hyphen.}} ({{IPA|fr|ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl ɑ̃dʁe ʒaʁ|lang}}; born 24 August 1948) is a French composer, performer and record producer. He is a pioneer in the [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[New-age music|new-age]] genres, and is known for organising outdoor [[spectacle]]s featuring his music, accompanied by vast [[Laser lighting display|laser displays]], large [[Projector|projections]] and [[fireworks]].\n\nJarre was raised in Lyon by his mother and grandparents and trained on the piano. From an early age, he was introduced to a variety of art forms, including street performers, [[jazz]] musicians and the artist [[Pierre Soulages]]. His musical style was perhaps most heavily influenced by [[Pierre Schaeffer]], a pioneer of [[musique concrète]] at the [[Groupe de Recherches Musicales]].\n\nHis first mainstream success was the 1976 album ''[[Oxygène]]''. Recorded in a makeshift studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 18&nbsp;million copies. ''Oxygène'' was followed in 1978 by ''[[Equinoxe]]'', and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience of more than a million people at the [[Place de la Concorde]], a record he has since broken three times. More albums followed, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events.\n\nAs of 2004, Jarre had sold an estimated 80&nbsp;million albums and singles. He was the first [[Western world|Western]] musician officially invited to perform in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and held the [[List of highest-attended concerts|world record for the largest-ever audience at an outdoor event]] for his [[Moscow]] concert on 6 September 1997, which was reputed to have been attended by about 3.5 million people.",
