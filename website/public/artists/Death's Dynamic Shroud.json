  "description": "'''Death's Dynamic Shroud''' (stylized in [[all lowercase]]; also known as '''death's dynamic shroud.wmv''' under specific releases) is an American [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[vaporwave]] trio consisting of James Webster, Tech Honors, and [[Giant Claw|Keith Rankin]]. The band releases a large amount of music regularly as sample-driven [[mixtape]]s under the .wmv moniker, in addition to releasing more standard mainline albums.\n\nThe band's conception started with just James Webster and Tech Honors in late 2013, releasing their first mixtape (by James) on January 2, 2014. Keith Rankin joined later in August that same year in the co-creation of the first mainline album ''신세기 EVANGELIS'' with James Webster. However, James Webster and Tech Honors had been creating music together and independently, for several years prior. In 2017, with the release of their album ''Heavy Black Heart,'' the group used the name, 'death's dynamic shroud' for mainline albums, and 'death's dynamic shroud.wmv' for their NUWRLD mixtape series.",
