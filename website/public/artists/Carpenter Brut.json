  "name": "Carpenter Brut",
  "description": "'''Franck Hueso''', better known by his [[stage name]] '''Carpenter Brut''', is a French [[Synthwave|darksynth]] artist from [[Poitiers]], [[France]]. He has released three EPs, ''EP I'' (2012), ''EP II'' (2013) and ''EP III'' (2015), which were collected and released together as the album ''Trilogy'' (2015). He later released three additional studio albums, ''Leather Teeth'' (2018), ''Blood Machines OST'' (2020) and ''Leather Terror'' (2022), along with one live album, ''CarpenterBrutLive'' (2017). He has also contributed original music to a variety of soundtracks, both for film and video games.\n\nCarpenter Brut claims his relative anonymity is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music itself, rather than the identity of the musician behind it. He started writing music as Carpenter Brut with the intention of mixing sounds from horror films, metal, rock, and electronic music. In live performances Carpenter Brut is joined on stage by guitarist Adrien Grousset and drummer Florent Marcadet, both from the French metal band [[Hacride]].",
