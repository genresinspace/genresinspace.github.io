  "description": "'''Meat Puppets''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in January 1980 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. The group's original lineup was [[Curt Kirkwood]] (guitar/vocals), his brother [[Cris Kirkwood]] (bass guitar/vocals), and [[Derrick Bostrom]] (drums). The Kirkwood brothers met Bostrom while attending [[Brophy College Preparatory|Brophy Prep High School]] in Phoenix. The three then moved to [[Tempe, Arizona]] (a Phoenix suburb and home to [[Arizona State University]]), where the Kirkwood brothers purchased two adjacent houses, one of which had a shed in the back where they regularly practiced.\n\nMeat Puppets started as a [[punk rock]] band, but like most of their labelmates on [[SST Records]], they established their own unique style, blending punk with [[country music|country]] and [[psychedelic rock]], and featuring Curt's warbling vocals. Meat Puppets later gained significant exposure when the Kirkwood brothers served as guest musicians on [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[MTV Unplugged in New York|''MTV Unplugged'' performance]] in 1993. The band's 1994 album ''[[Too High to Die]]'' subsequently became their most successful release. The band broke up twice, in 1996 and 2002, but reunited again in 2006.",
