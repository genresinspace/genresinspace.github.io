  "name": "Nicky Jam",
  "description": "'''Nick Rivera Caminero''' (born March 17, 1981), known professionally as '''Nicky Jam''', is an American singer. He is best known for hits such as \"[[X (Nicky Jam and J Balvin song)|X]]\", \"[[Travesuras]]\", \"[[El Perdón]]\", \"[[Hasta el Amanecer]]\", and \"[[El Amante]]\"; the latter three are from his 2017 album ''[[Fénix (Nicky Jam album)|Fénix]]''. He has frequently collaborated with other Latin artists such as [[Daddy Yankee]], [[J Balvin]], [[Ozuna]], [[Plan B (duo)|Plan B]] and [[Anuel AA]]. While his early music exemplified traditional fast-paced reggaeton, his newer compositions place more emphasis on sung vocals and romantic lyrics.\n\nBorn in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], to a Dominican mother and a Puerto Rican father, he moved with his family to Puerto Rico when he was ten years old. He began recording music at age fourteen with his first EP ''[[...Distinto a los demás]]'' (1995), and eventually caught the attention of Daddy Yankee. The two formed the group Los Cangris, which was active from the late 1990s to 2004. The pair split acrimoniously, and Nicky Jam's career quickly took a sharp decline, followed by a period of legal struggles and substance abuse.\n\nHe then moved to [[Medellín]], Colombia, where he rejuvenated his career and developed a more melodic style of music, which proved to be popular through the release of the singles \"Voy a Beber\" and \"Travesuras\" in 2014. His success was furthered by the 2015 single \"El Perdón\" and his 2017 album ''Fénix''. He released the album ''[[Íntimo]]'' in 2019, which was a critical and commercial success. Nicky Jam has also acted in the films ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage]]'' (2017) and ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'' (2020), and starred in and executive produced the [[Netflix]] biographical series ''[[Nicky Jam: El Ganador]]'' (2018).",
