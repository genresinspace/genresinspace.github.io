Nicknamed \"the Boss\", Springsteen has released 21 studio albums spanning six decades; most of his albums feature the [[E Street Band]], his backing band since 1972. Springsteen is a pioneer of [[heartland rock]], combining commercially successful rock with poetic, socially conscious lyrics that reflect [[working class]] American life. He is known for his energetic concerts, some of which last more than four hours.\n\nSpringsteen released his first two albums, ''[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]'' and ''[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]'', in 1973. Although both were well-received by critics, neither earned him a large audience. He changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with ''[[Born to Run]]'' (1975). Springsteen followed with ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'' (1978) and ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'' (1980), Springsteen's first album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After the solo acoustic album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' (1982), he recorded ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' (1984) with the E Street Band, which became his most commercially successful album and the [[List of best-selling albums|23rd-best selling album of all time]] as of 2024. All seven singles from ''Born in the U.S.A.'' reached the Top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including the [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|title track]]. Springsteen mostly hired session musicians for the recording of his next three albums, ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'' (1987), ''[[Human Touch]]'' (1992), and ''[[Lucky Town]]'' (1992). He reassembled the E Street Band for ''[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1995), and recorded the acoustic album ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]'' (1995) and the EP ''[[Blood Brothers (EP)|Blood Brothers]]'' (1996) solo.\n\nSpringsteen then released ''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]'' (2002), which was dedicated to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]]. He released two more folk albums, ''[[Devils & Dust]]'' (2005) and ''[[We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions]]'' (2006), his first cover album. Springsteen followed with two more albums with the E Street Band, ''[[Magic (Bruce Springsteen album)|Magic]]'' (2007) and ''[[Working on a Dream]]'' (2009). His next albums, ''[[Wrecking Ball (Bruce Springsteen album)|Wrecking Ball]]'' (2012) and ''[[High Hopes (album)|High Hopes]]'' (2014), topped album charts worldwide. In 2017, 2018 and 2021, Springsteen performed the critically acclaimed show ''[[Springsteen on Broadway]]'', in which he performed songs and told stories from [[Born to Run (autobiography)|his 2016 autobiography]]; an [[Springsteen on Broadway (album)|album version]] from the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances was released in 2018.
