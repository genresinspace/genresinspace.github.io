  "description": "'''DNCE''' was an American dance-rock band consisting of lead singer [[Joe Jonas]] (previously of the [[Jonas Brothers]]), drummer [[Jack Lawless]] (who previously performed with [[Demi Lovato]]), and guitarist [[JinJoo Lee]] (who previously worked with [[CeeLo Green]]). Bassist and keyboardist Cole Whittle (previously of [[Semi Precious Weapons]]) was a part of the band from when it started in 2015 to when it went on hiatus in 2018. DNCE's music is mainly [[dance-rock]], [[dance-pop]], [[pop rock]], and [[funk]]-[[pop music|pop]]. The band signed with [[Republic Records]] and released their debut single, \"[[Cake by the Ocean]]\", on September 18, 2015. The song reached the top 10 on several charts, including on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at number nine. The band's second single, \"[[Toothbrush (song)|Toothbrush]]\", was moderately successful.\n\nTheir debut extended play (EP), ''[[Swaay]]'', was released on October 23, 2015. It peaked at number 39 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified [[Platinum record|platinum]]. After appearing on the positively-received [[Grease Live!|''Grease Live!'']], their [[DNCE (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] was released on November 18, 2016 and peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' 200, earning a gold certification. Their second EP, ''[[People to People (EP)|People to People]]'', was released on June 15, 2018, but did not chart. The band was also nominated for Favorite New Artist for the [[2016 Kids' Choice Awards]] and Best Song to Lip Sync and Best Anthem for the [[2016 Radio Disney Music Awards]], and performed at the 2017 Fashion Meets Music Festival. \n\nIn 2018, after ''People to People'' and their non-album single \"Dance\" had limited success, the band went on an indefinite hiatus. After the group went on a hiatus, Jonas rejoined the Jonas Brothers and Lee began performing with acts such as [[Charli XCX]]. In February 2022, DNCE returned (albeit, without Whittle) after their hiatus, with a collaboration with [[Kygo]] titled \"[[Dancing Feet (song)|Dancing Feet]]\". The band released three more songs afterwards (\"Move\", \"Got Me Good\", and \"Flamingo\", the latter for the movie [[Anything's Possible (film)|''Anything's'' ''Possible'']]) before going on hiatus once again in 2024.",
