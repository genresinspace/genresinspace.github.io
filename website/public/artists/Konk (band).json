  "description": "'''KONK''' was an American band formed in 1980 in [[New York City]] and active until 1988 that emerged during a period marked by the [[post-punk]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] and [[disco]] scenes which were prevalent at the time. KONK won the attention of both scenes by playing a hybrid of the two musical styles which involved the blending of a [[New wave music|new wave]] attitude with the carefree nature of [[disco]]'s dance crowd. KONK's musical influences ranged from [[Afrobeat]], [[jazz]] and [[funk]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. Given these influence KONK's style is noted as being highly percussive, and containing simple, yet strong, backing bass lines. As part of New Yorkâ€™s [[post-punk]] dance scene they regularly played alongside groups such as [[Liquid Liquid]], [[Bush Tetras]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]], [[the Peech Boys]] and [[the Lounge Lizards]]. They are included in a book by [[David Byrne]] and others on the New York post-punk scene.",
