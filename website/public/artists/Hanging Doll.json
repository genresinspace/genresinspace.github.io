  "description": "'''Hanging Doll''' are a British [[gothic metal]] band from [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]]. The members include Sally Holliday (vocals/songwriter), Dan Leddy (guitars/vocals) and Kev Wilson (bass/vocals).\n\nThe full line-up of Hanging Doll took form after Dan (a guitarist with a degree in orchestral composition) and Alex Cooper, who had been working together since 2002, invited Holliday, a professional photographer, to take pictures of an early version of the band in 2004 (Cooper, Leddy, Wilson and the original vocalist Emily Brownhill). After Brownhill quit shortly afterwards, Holliday was invited to audition and recruited to fill the position. Aryan Amoli was brought into the band on keyboards about a year later.\n \nHanging Doll's debut album was ''Reason & Madness'', released on the record label Phoenix Music [UK] Ltd / [[Cargo Records (UK)|Cargo Records]].\n\nHanging Doll were signed to Rocksector Records in early 2012 and announced they would release their next album, ''The Sacred & Profane'', on 30 April 2012, with the first music video for the track \"Carnival Of Sin\" having already been released on 22 February of the same year. However, the album was delayed and was released on 3 September.",
