  "description": "'''Electro Hippies''' were an English [[thrashcore]] band formed in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]]/[[Wigan]], England, in 1985.\n\nThough they were short-lived and underground through their career, their music influenced many future crust, [[hardcore punk]], and grindcore bands. The band relied heavily on low bass end sounds to create their low-fi, primitively produced music. They also incorporated elements of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and have been described as \"proto-grindcore\". The band strongly embraced the D.I.Y. ([[do it yourself]]) ethic which was very common among many early crust punk bands.  The band's lyrics spoke heavily about [[animal rights]] and [[vegetarianism]].  A recurring lyrical theme on each LP targeted the [[McDonald's]] corporation, evidenced by the lyrics to \"Run Ronald\" and \"Scum\".\n\nThe band were supported by [[John Peel]] for whom they recorded a radio session in 1987, released as an [[Extended play|EP]] by [[Strange Fruit Records]] the same year.\n\nThe Electro Hippies included [[Jeff Walker (musician)|Jeff Walker]] (guitar, vocals) in their ranks. He later joined [[extreme metal]] band [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]]. When Walker joined Carcass full-time, Simon  (drums) and Andy (guitar) took over vocal duties.  Eventually, the band split up in 1989, playing one last gig and releasing the show as their final album.",
