  "description": "'''The La's''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Liverpool]], originally active from 1983 until 1992. Fronted by singer, songwriter and guitarist [[Lee Mavers]], the group are best known for their hit single \"[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]\". The band was formed by [[Mike Badger]] in 1983 and Mavers joined the next year, although for most of the group's history, the frequently changing line-up revolved around the core duo of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar) and [[John Power (musician)|John Power]] (bass, backing vocals) along with numerous other guitarists and drummers including [[Paul Hemmings]], John \"Timmo\" Timson, Peter \"Cammy\" Cammell, Iain Templeton, John \"Boo\" Byrne, [[Chris Sharrock]],  and Neil Mavers.\n\nAfter the departure of Badger in late 1986, the band signed to [[Go! Discs]] in 1987 and started recording their debut album. Following the release of singles \"[[Way Out (The La's song)|Way Out]]\" (1987), \"There She Goes\" (1988) and \"[[Timeless Melody]]\" (1990) and having aborted several recording sessions with different producers, the band released their debut album, ''[[The La's (album)|The La's]]'', in 1990 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success. John Power left the La's to form [[Cast (band)|Cast]] and the group entered a prolonged hiatus in 1992. The group later reformed briefly in the mid-1990s, 2005 and 2011, but no new recordings have been released.",
