The core of the group was composed of brothers [[MF Doom|Daniel \"Zev Love X\" Dumile]] and [[DJ Subroc|Dingilizwe \"DJ Subroc\" Dumile]]. The group's original third member, Jade 1 (believed to later be known as Rodan), left before the group signed with [[Elektra Records]], being replaced with Onyx the Birthstone Kid. The group dissolved in 1994 following the sudden death of DJ Subroc in 1993, the departure of Onyx and conflicts with Elektra that resulted in them being dropped from the label.\n\nKMD released two studio albums, ''[[Mr. Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Black Bastards]]''; the latter of which was recorded in 1993 and not officially released until 2000. Zev Love X subsequently changed his moniker to [[MF DOOM]] and achieved success as a solo artist. MF DOOM attempted to revive the KMD name in the 2010s, releasing two new songs, \"Sorcerers\" and \"True Lightyears\", and announcing a comeback album in 2017, but no further updates or recordings surfaced before his death in October 2020.",
