She first gained attention in 1979 with the release of her hit single \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\", which peaked at number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made her a leading figure of the [[New wave music|new wave]] music scene. She is equally notable for her eccentric hairstyle, clothing and quirky sense of humor while performing.\n\nBorn in [[Detroit]], Michigan, Lovich moved to England at the age of 13, where she met guitarist and songwriter Les Chappell, who later became her long-time music collaborator and life partner. She developed an interest in art and theater, enrolling at the [[Central School of Art and Design]] where she took [[saxophone]] lessons. In 1975, she joined the band the Diversions and shortly afterwards wrote the lyrics to [[Cerrone]]'s single \"[[Supernature (song)|Supernature]]\". After the band broke up, Lovich started looking for another band to join and contacted the radio presenter [[Charlie Gillett]], who got her to record a demo of [[Tommy James and the Shondells]]' song \"[[I Think We're Alone Now#Lene Lovich version|I Think We're Alone Now]]\" and played it to [[Dave Robinson (music executive)|Dave Robinson]] of [[Stiff Records]], who decided to sign Lovich. The song was released as a single and appeared on her debut studio album ''[[Stateless (Lene Lovich album)|Stateless]]'' (1978), which produced the single \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\".\n\nShe released two more albums, ''[[Flex (album)|Flex]]'' (1979) and ''[[No Man's Land (Lene Lovich album)|No Man's Land]]'' (1982), on Stiff Records. In 1989, she independently released the album ''[[March (Lene Lovich album)|March]]'', before her 15-year hiatus. She focused more on her family but came back in 2005 with the release of her album ''[[Shadows and Dust]]''. In 2013, she established her own publishing label, Flex Music, and released a re-mastered version of all her previous albums in a limited edition [[box set]].",
