  "description": "'''Social Distortion''' is an American [[punk rock]] band formed in 1978 in [[Fullerton, California]]. It consists of [[Mike Ness]] (vocals, guitar), [[Jonny Wickersham]] (guitar), [[Brent Harding]] (bass), [[David Hidalgo Jr.]] (drums), and David Kalish (keyboards).\n\nEmerging from the [[Punk rock in California|Orange County hardcore scene]] of the late 1970s, alongside [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]] and the [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]], Social Distortion went on a temporary hiatus in the mid-1980s, due to Ness's drug addiction and troubles with the law which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers that lasted for two years. Following their reformation, the band shifted its style to a [[Country music|country]], [[Blues music|blues]], and early [[Rock and Roll|rock and roll]]–influenced style of punk. Since its inception, the band's lineup has seen significant turnover, with Ness as the only constant member. Past longtime members have included guitarist [[Dennis Danell]], bassist [[John Maurer (Social Distortion)|John Maurer]] and drummers [[Christopher Reece]] and [[Charlie Quintana]].  After {{Age|1978|1|1}} years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music.\n\nTo date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two [[compilation album|compilations]], one live album, and two [[DVD]]s. They released two albums—''[[Mommy's Little Monster (album)|Mommy's Little Monster]]'' (1983) and ''[[Prison Bound]]'' (1988)—before signing a three-album contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 [[Social Distortion (album)|self-titled third album]], which produced their well-known hit singles \"[[Ball and Chain (Social Distortion song)|Ball and Chain]]\", \"[[Story of My Life (Social Distortion song)|Story of My Life]]\", and the cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Many of their later albums, including their second gold record, ''[[Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell]]'' (1992), have also been well received. Dubbed by [[Steven Blush]] as \"[[the Rolling Stones]] of hardcore,\" Social Distortion is considered one of the best-selling and most influential punk rock bands, with more than three million albums sold worldwide. The band's most recent studio album is ''[[Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes]]'' (2011), and they have spent more than a decade working on new material for their forthcoming eighth studio album.",
