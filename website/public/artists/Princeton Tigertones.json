  "description": "The '''Princeton Tigertones''' are an internationally known all-male [[college|collegiate]] [[a cappella]] group from [[Princeton University]]. The group was founded in 1946, and since then has produced thirty-two albums. The Tigertones, known informally as \"The 'Tones\", draw from a repertoire of nearly a hundred songs that have been arranged exclusively by members of the group, and which range in [[genre]] from traditional choral arrangements to [[barbershop quartet]] standards, modern jazz, the \"[[jazz standard|American songbook]]\", and contemporary [[popular culture|pop culture]] hits.\n\nIn addition to extensive performing on Princeton's campus, the group frequently tours the [[United States]] and the world, and has traveled across the United States, Europe, and Asia to perform in such storied venues as [[New York City]]'s [[Carnegie Hall]], London's [[Barbican Centre]], and aboard [[Cunard Line]]'s ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. The Tigertones have performed before heads of state including President [[Bill Clinton]] and the late [[Yitzhak Rabin]], and, in 2010, performed three times at the [[White House]] for an audience including [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]].\n\nThe Tigertones have been profiled in dozens of publications, including a 1995 article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. They are historically notable for being the first collegiate a cappella group to release an album in [[compact disc]] format (1989's \"''Ba Da Ya Ba Da.''\") and the first collegiate a cappella group to have a page on the [[World Wide Web]], dating from March 1994.",
