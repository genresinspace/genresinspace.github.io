  "description": "'''Sudden Rush''' is a [[na mele paleoleo|nā mele paleoleo]] (Hawaiian [[Hip hop music|hip hop/rap]]) group from [[Hilo]], [[Hawaii]], comprising Shane Veincent (\"Kid Dynomite\"), Caleb Richards (\"Red Eye\"/\"Pakalo\"), Don Keʻala Kawaʻauhau Jr. (\"King Don 1\") and Rob Onekea (\"Radical Rob\"). They have been called the most well-known and successful of the Hawaiian hip hop groups and were the first to blend American hip hop with [[Hawaiian language]] and musical style to produce nā mele paleoleo. Formed in 1993, they released three studio albums in the next ten years, followed by the belated ''Overthrow'' EP in 2018. Their music is explicitly political and supportive of the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]].",
