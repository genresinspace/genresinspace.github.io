  "description": "'''Stone Temple Pilots''', commonly abbreviated as '''STP''', is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Diego]], California, in 1989. Originally consisting of lead vocalist [[Scott Weiland]], guitarist [[Dean DeLeo]], bassist [[Robert DeLeo]], and drummer Eric Kretz, the band's lineup remained unchanged from its formation until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Vocalist [[Chester Bennington]] joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. In 2016, STP launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; [[Jeff Gutt]] was announced as STP's new lead singer on November 14, 2017.\n\nAfter forming under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with [[Atlantic Records]] and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. Their debut album, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'', released in 1992, was a major commercial hit, and STP went on to become one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling more than 18 million albums in the United States and 40 million worldwide. STP released four more studio albums: ''[[Purple (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Purple]]'' (1994), ''[[Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop]]'' (1996), ''[[No.&nbsp;4 (album)|No.&nbsp;4]]'' (1999), and ''[[Shangri-La Dee Da]]'' (2001), before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably [[Velvet Revolver]] and [[Army of Anyone]]). STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a [[2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour|reunion tour]] and released their [[Stone Temple Pilots (2010 album)|self-titled sixth album]] in 2010. After firing Weiland in 2013, the band recruited Chester Bennington, who they would tour with as their lead vocalist up until his departure in 2015. The band's only material with Bennington was the 2013 EP ''[[High Rise (EP)|High Rise]]''. STP has since released two albums with Gutt on vocals: its [[Stone Temple Pilots (2018 album)|second self-titled album]] in 2018 and eighth studio album, ''[[Perdida (album)|Perdida]]'', in 2020.\n\nWhile initially rising to fame as part of the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band explored a variety of styles, including [[psychedelic rock]], [[bossa nova]], and [[classic rock]]. STP's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with [[drug addiction]].",
