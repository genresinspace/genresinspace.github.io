  "description": "'''Stone Temple Pilots''', commonly abbreviated as '''STP''', is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Diego]], [[California]], in 1989. Originally consisting of lead vocalist [[Scott Weiland]], drummer Eric Kretz, and brothers [[Dean DeLeo|Dean]] (guitar) and [[Robert DeLeo]] (bass), the band's lineup remained unchanged from its formation until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. [[Linkin Park]] vocalist [[Chester Bennington]] joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. Weiland died that December, while Bennington died two years later. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; [[Jeff Gutt]] was ultimately announced as their new lead singer on November 14, 2017.\n\nAfter forming under the name Swing (later Mighty Joe Young), the band signed with [[Atlantic Records]] and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. Their debut album, ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]'', released in 1992, was a major commercial hit. STP released four more studio albums – ''[[Purple (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Purple]]'' (1994), ''[[Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop]]'' (1996), ''[[No.&nbsp;4 (album)|No.&nbsp;4]]'' (1999), and ''[[Shangri-La Dee Da]]'' (2001) – before separating acrimoniously in 2003. The band members then partook in various projects, most notably [[Velvet Revolver]] and [[Army of Anyone]], before reconvening in 2008 for a [[2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour|reunion tour]]. They then released their [[Stone Temple Pilots (2010 album)|self-titled sixth album]] in 2010. In 2013, the band released their debut EP ''[[High Rise (EP)|High Rise]]'', which was their only release ever recorded with Bennington as lead vocalist. STP have since released two albums with Gutt on vocals: a [[Stone Temple Pilots (2018 album)|second self-titled album]] in 2018, and ''[[Perdida (album)|Perdida]]'' in 2020.\n\nWhile initially rising to fame as part of the [[grunge]] movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band explored a variety of styles, including [[psychedelic rock]], [[bossa nova]], and [[classic rock]]. Stone Temple Pilots are regarded as one of the most successful rock bands of the 1990s, having sold more than 18 million albums in the United States and 40 million worldwide that decade.",
