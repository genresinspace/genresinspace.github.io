  "description": "'''Kinto Sol''' is a [[Latin hip hop]] group based in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The group consists of three brothers: DJ Payback Garcia (Javier Garcia), El Chivo (Eduardo Garcia) and Skribe (Manuel Garcia); originally from Iramuco, [[Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]], they moved to the [[United States|US]] at a very young age due to financial struggle. Initially, they would rap in English, but after their first self-titled album they began rapping mainly in Spanish. The group would blend traditional [[Mexican music]] with hip hop style beats, giving them their unique sound. They own their own independent record label, Virus Enterprises LLC, which specializes in Latin hip hop. The group's name is a phonetic spelling of \"[[Aztec calendar|quinto sol]]\" (fifth sun), and is taken from an Aztec legend in which the Fifth Sun will be the last one to set in this lifetime.\n\n''Los Hijos Del Maiz'' was awarded the best Latin Hip Hop album of the year for its content and best sales history.\nEl Chivo has also released two independent solo albums. His latest album, ''Cicatrices'' reached number 5 on the Latin Billboard charts \"Latin Rhythm Album\" and it was an independent release with no backing of a major record label.\n\n''El Ultimo Suspiro'' [The Last Breath] is the sixth studio album by Kinto Sol released on October 19, 2010 on Machete Music. The album debuted #1 in the Latin Billboard Charts Latin Rhythm.",
