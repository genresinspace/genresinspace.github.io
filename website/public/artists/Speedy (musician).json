  "description": "'''Sir Speedy''' (born '''Juan Antonio Ortiz Garcia''') is a Puerto Rican [[reggaeton]] singer.\n\nIn 2005, he released a remix of the single \"[[Siéntelo]]\" (\"Feel It\") which was originally recorded for the 2001 various artists compilation ''Sandunguero'', by [[DJ Blass]]. The remix featured [[Lumidee]] and hit the top 10 in Belgium, Finland, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called it \"the first international reggaetón hit\". ''[[PopMatters]]'' critic Matt Cibula described Speedy as \"charismatic and spunky\", and said that despite its sometimes confusing lyrics and Speedy's \"thin\" voice, Speedy's 2005 album ''Nueva Generación'' was possibly the best reggaeton album of the year and \"an excellent example of what intelligent and sophisticated but unpretentious pop music can do when it wants to.\"\n\nOther artists he has worked with include [[Plan B (duo)|Plan B]], [[Daddy Yankee]] and [[Lito & Polaco]]. Speedy is currently working on new mixtapes for his label Yoko-Joe Records.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}",
