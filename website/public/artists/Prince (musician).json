Regarded as one of the most influential musicians of his generation, Prince was known for his flamboyant, [[androgynous]] persona, wide vocal range—which included a far-reaching [[falsetto]]—and high-pitched screams, as well as his skill as a multi-instrumentalist, often preferring to play all or most of the instruments on his recordings. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles, including [[funk]], [[disco]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[soul music|soul]], [[synth-pop]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the [[Minneapolis sound]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Minneapolis]], Prince signed a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] at the age of 18, soon releasing the studio albums ''[[For You (Prince album)|For You]]'' (1978) and ''[[Prince (album)|Prince]]'' (1979). He went on to achieve critical success with the influential albums ''[[Dirty Mind]]'' (1980), ''[[Controversy (Prince album)|Controversy]]'' (1981), and ''[[1999 (Prince album)|1999]]'' (1982). In 1984, Prince became the first singer to simultaneously have a number-one film, album and single in the US, with the film ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'', [[Purple Rain (album)|its soundtrack]], and his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart-topping single \"[[When Doves Cry]]\", which later ranked as the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984|biggest hit of the year]].

After moving to [[Arista Records]] in 1998, Prince reverted to his original name in 2000. Over the next decade, six of his albums entered the U.S. top 10 charts.
