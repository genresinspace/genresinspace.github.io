  "description": "'''Crazyhead''' are an English [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]] [[music group|band]] from [[Leicester]], England. Though lumped in with the largely media-created [[Grebo (music)|grebo]] scene, they were more influenced by the [[garage rock]] of the late 1960s, as well as bands like the [[Ramones]], [[The Stooges]] and [[Captain Beefheart]]. They have often described themselves as an ''\"urban bastard blues band\"'', and their songs range in theme from trenchant social commentary to the surreal, but always with an underlying vein of black humour.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}",
