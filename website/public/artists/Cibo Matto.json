  "description": "'''Cibo Matto''' ({{IPA|it|ˈtʃiːbo ˈmatto|pron}}; {{langnf|it||crazy food}}) was an American [[alternative rock]] band formed by [[Yuka Honda]] and [[Miho Hatori]] in New York City in 1994. Their first album, ''[[Viva! La Woman]]'' (1996), had lyrics primarily concerned with food. For their second album, ''[[Stereo Type A]]'' (1999), they expanded into broader subject matter and recruited [[Sean Lennon]], [[Timo Ellis]], and Duma Love.\n\nHonda and Hatori are Japanese [[expatriate]]s. Their first album sold 40,000 copies in Japan, but was more successful in the U.S., with over 74,000 copies sold. Over time, their following in Japan grew, which resulted in their signing to Japanese record label [[Commmons]] in 2014.\n\nAfter an almost decade-long hiatus, Honda and Hatori reunited in 2011, playing a series of concerts and recording new material. They released their third and final studio album, ''[[Hotel Valentine]],'' in 2014. It reached number 168 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Cibo Matto announced their split in December 2017.",
