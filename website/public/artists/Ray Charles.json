He is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential musicians in history, and was often referred to by contemporaries as \"The Genius\". Among friends and fellow musicians, he preferred being called \"Brother Ray\". Charles was blinded during childhood, possibly due to [[glaucoma]].\n\nCharles pioneered the [[soul music]] genre during the 1950s by combining elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]] into his music during his time with [[Atlantic Records]]. He contributed to the integration of [[country music]], rhythm and blues, and [[pop music]] during the 1960s with his crossover success on [[ABC Records]], notably with his two ''Modern Sounds'' albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.\n\nCharles' 1960s hit \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\" was the first of his three career No. 1 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. His 1962 album ''[[Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music]]'' became his first album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with [[Quincy Jones]]. [[Frank Sinatra]] called Ray Charles \"the only true genius in show business\", although Charles downplayed this notion. [[Billy Joel]] said, \"This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than [[Elvis Presley]].\"\n\nFor his musical contributions, Charles received the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], the [[National Medal of Arts]], and the [[Polar Music Prize]]. He was one of the inaugural inductees at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986. He has won 17 [[Grammy Awards]] (five posthumously), the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1987, and 10 of his recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].
