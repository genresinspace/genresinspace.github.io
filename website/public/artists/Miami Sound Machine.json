  "description": "'''Miami Sound Machine''' was an American Latin pop band of Latin-influenced music that featured the vocals of Cuban-born recording artist [[Gloria Estefan]] (née Fajardo). Established in 1975 by [[Emilio Estefan]], the band was originally known as the '''Miami Latin Boys''' before becoming the Miami Sound Machine in 1977.\n\nThe band released 13 albums and a string of hit singles until 1989. The band's 1985 album ''[[Primitive Love]]'' credited the band whereas their follow-up album ''[[Let It Loose (album)|Let It Loose]]'' in 1987 placed Gloria Estefan at the forefront. From 1988 to 1989, the latter album was also repackaged as ''Anything for You'' with new cover art with the international release in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1989, the group's name ceased being included on the CD or album products—as Estefan continued as a solo artist.",
