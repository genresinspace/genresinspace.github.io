  "description": "'''Big Bad Voodoo Daddy''' is a contemporary [[swing revival]] band from [[Southern California]]. Their notable singles include \"Go Daddy-O\", \"You & Me & the Bottle Makes 3 Tonight (Baby)\", and \"Mr. Pinstripe Suit\". The band played at the [[Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show]] in 1999.\n\nThe band was originally formed in Ventura, California, in 1989 by leader Scotty Morris (guitar and vocals). The band was named Big Bad Voodoo Daddy after Scotty Morris met blues guitar legend [[Albert Collins]] at one of the latter's concerts. \"He signed my poster 'To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy',\" Morris explains. \"I thought it was the coolest name I ever heard on one of the coolest musical nights I ever had. So when it came time to name this band, I didn't really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me.\"\n\nMorris and drummer Kurt Sodergren are the two original members who have appeared in every incarnation of the band. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy has concentrated on performing their own interpretations of swing music of the 1940s and 1950s and original songs in a similar style, regularly touring and performing worldwide.",
