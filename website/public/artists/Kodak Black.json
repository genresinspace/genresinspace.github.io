  "description": "'''Bill Kahan Kapri''' (born '''Dieuson Octave'''; June 11, 1997), known professionally as '''Kodak Black''', is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He gained initial recognition following the release of his 2014 songs \"[[No Flockin]]\" and \"[[Skrt]]\", both of which led him to sign a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. The former received [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry of America]] (RIAA), while the latter received platinum certification; \"No Flockin\" marked his first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] two years later as a [[sleeper hit]].\n\nHis 2017 single, \"[[Tunnel Vision (Kodak Black song)|Tunnel Vision]]\" was met with further success at number six on the chart and preceded the release of his debut studio album ''[[Painting Pictures]]'' (2017), which peaked at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. His first commercial mixtape (and fifth overall), ''[[Project Baby 2]]'', was released that same year and peaked at number two on the chart, also spawning the [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]]-certified single \"[[Roll in Peace]]\" (featuring [[XXXTentacion]]). His second album, ''[[Dying to Live (Kodak Black album)|Dying to Live]]'' (2018) yielded his furthest commercial success and peaked atop the ''Billboard'' 200. It spawned the single \"[[Zeze (song)|Zeze]]\" (featuring [[Travis Scott]] and [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]]), which peaked at two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, received [[RIAA certification|sextuple platinum]] certification by the RIAA, and remains his highest-charting song.\n\nKodak Black's career has been marked by periods of mainstream success, as well as public controversies and legal issues. His legal troubles began in middle school and spiked crucially throughout the late 2010s. Black was accused of rape in 2016 and faced the charge of [[Rape laws in the United States#South Carolina|first-degree criminal sexual conduct]] in South Carolina. He was given a [[plea bargain]] in 2021 to the lesser offense of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] and was sentenced to [[probation]]. In 2019, Black was arrested for [[making false statements]] to possess weapons and was sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison; his sentence was [[Commute a sentence|commuted]] by President [[Donald Trump]] in 2021.\n\nWhile incarcerated, he released his third album ''[[Bill Israel]]'' (2020), which saw less promotion and commercial orientation. His 2021 single, \"[[Super Gremlin]]\" saw a commercial resurgence, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It was included on fourth album, ''[[Back for Everything]]'' (2022). His fifth and sixth albums, ''[[Pistolz & Pearlz]]'' and ''[[When I Was Dead]]'', were both released in 2023.",
