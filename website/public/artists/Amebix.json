A pioneer of the [[crust punk]] genre, Amebix's merger of [[anarcho-punk]] and [[post-punk]] with elements of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], particularly early [[extreme metal]], inspired musicians who would go on to define the genres of [[grindcore]], [[black metal]], [[death-doom]] and [[metalcore]].\n\nFormed in 1978 as '''the Band with No Name''', the band's two consistent members were brothers [[Rob Miller (musician)|Rob \"the Baron\" Miller]] (vocals, bass) and Chris \"Stig\" Miller (guitar). The band's earliest releases were [[post-punk]], before beginning to adopt elements of [[heavy metal music]] on their debut album ''[[No Sanctuary (album)|No Sanctuary]]'' (1983). This album was one of the earliest examples of the crust punk genre, a style which the band would codify with its follow up ''[[Arise! (Amebix album)|Arise!]]'' (1985). Shortly after the release of their third album ''[[Monolith (Amebix album)|Monolith]]'' (1987), the group disbanded. The band reunited in 2008, along with drummer [[Roy Mayorga]], a lineup which released their fourth album ''[[Sonic Mass]]'' (2011), before disbanding again in 2012.",
