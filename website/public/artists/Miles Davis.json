  "description": "'''Miles Dewey Davis III''' (May 26, 1926{{spaced ndash}}September 28, 1991) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and [[20th century music|20th-century music]]. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a roughly five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.\n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family in [[Alton, Illinois]], and raised in [[East St. Louis]], Davis started on the trumpet in his early teens. He left to study at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]]. In the early 1950s, while addicted to heroin, Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music under [[Prestige Records]]. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]], and recorded the album ''[['Round About Midnight]]'' in 1955.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]]–influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\n\nDavis made several lineup changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another commercial success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]. After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P. (Miles Davis album)|E.S.P.]]'' (1965) and ''[[Miles Smiles]]'' (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African rhythms]], emerging [[Music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic music technology]], and an ever-changing lineup of musicians, including keyboardist [[Joe Zawinul]], drummer [[Al Foster]], bassist [[Michael Henderson]], and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].{{sfn|Freeman|2005|pp=9–11, 155–156}} This period, beginning with Davis's 1969 studio album ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and concluding with the 1975 concert recording ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'', was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with [[jazz fusion]] as the decade progressed.\n\nAfter a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and [[popular music|pop]] sounds on albums such as ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' (1981), ''[[You're Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You're Under Arrest]]'' (1985) and ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]'' (1986). Critics were often unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, [[pneumonia]] and [[respiratory failure]]. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which recognized him as \"one of the key figures in the history of jazz\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described him as \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,\" while [[Gerald Early]] called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.",
