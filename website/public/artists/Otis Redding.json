  "description": "'''Otis Ray Redding Jr.''' (September 9, 1941 â€“ December 10, 1967) was an American singer and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of American [[popular music]] and a seminal artist in [[soul music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Nicknamed the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Soul]]\", Redding's style of singing drew inspiration from the [[gospel music]] that preceded the genre. His vocal style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s.\n\nRedding was born in [[Dawson, Georgia]], and his family soon moved to [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]. He dropped out of high school at age 15 to support his family, working with [[Little Richard]]'s backing band, [[The Upsetters (American band)|the Upsetters]], and performing in talent shows at Macon's historic [[Douglass Theatre]]. In 1958, Redding joined [[Johnny Jenkins]]'s band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance at a [[Stax Records]] recording session led to a contract and Redding's first hit single, \"[[These Arms of Mine (Otis Redding song)|These Arms of Mine]]\", in 1962.\n\nStax released Redding's debut album, ''[[Pain in My Heart]]'', two years later. Initially popular mainly with African Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. Redding later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club [[Whisky a Go Go]] and toured Europe, performing in [[London]], [[Paris]] and other major cities. In June 1967, he performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].\n\nShortly before his death in a [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crash]], Redding wrote and recorded \"[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]\" with [[Steve Cropper]]. Released in January 1968, the song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Billboard Hot R&B|R&B]] charts. The album ''[[The Dock of the Bay (album)|The Dock of the Bay]]'' was the first [[List of posthumous number ones on the UK Albums Chart|posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart]]. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the [[Atco Records|Atco]] division of [[Atlantic Records]] owned the rights to his entire song catalog.\n\nRedding received many posthumous accolades, including two [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame|Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame]], and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. In addition to \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\", some of his best-known songs include his self-penned \"[[Respect (song)|Respect]]\" (1965), which later became more widely associated with [[Aretha Franklin]]'s cover, and Redding's rendition of \"[[Try a Little Tenderness]]\" (1966).",
