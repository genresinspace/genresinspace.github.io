  "description": "'''Hypnotize Minds Productions''', also known as '''Hypnotize Camp Posse''' or '''HCP''', was an American [[record label]] founded by [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] of [[Three 6 Mafia]] in 1997, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The label served as the successor to Three 6 Mafia's previous label, [[Prophet Entertainment]], which was co-founded by DJ Paul and Juicy J along with Nicholas ‘Nick Scarfo’ Jackson in 1994. Hypnotize Minds was created after DJ Paul and Juicy J had a disagreement with Jackson, which led to Three 6 Mafia and several other artists previously on the Prophet label to move to the new Hypnotize Minds imprint.\n\nAs Hypnotize Camp Posse, the collective released one self-titled group album, ''[[Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize Camp Posse|Hypnotize Camp Posse]]'', in 2000. The album follows the other Three 6 Mafia-sponsored posse album, 1998's ''[[Body Parts (Prophet Posse album)|Body Parts]]'' by [[Prophet Entertainment|Prophet Posse]], which features many of the same artists. Apart from the album, the group, like its predecessor, Prophet Posse, is known for their [[posse cut|posse songs]], which are featured on nearly every album release by Hypnotize Minds up until 2006, including all [[Three 6 Mafia]] albums. The posse songs feature verses from all or most members of the posse and label at the times of recording.\n\nHypnotize Minds has been assumed defunct since 2012 in conjuncture with Three 6 Mafia's hiatus. [[Lil Wyte]]'s ''[[Still Doubted?]]'' (released on June 19, 2012) is the label's most recent release.",
