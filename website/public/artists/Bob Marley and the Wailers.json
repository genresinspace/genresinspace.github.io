  "description": "'''Bob Marley and the Wailers''' (previously known as '''the Wailers''' and prior to that '''the Wailing Rudeboys''', '''the Wailing Wailers''' and '''the Teenagers''') were a Jamaican [[ska]], [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]] band. The founding members, in 1963, were [[Bob Marley]] (Robert Nesta Marley), [[Peter Tosh]] (Winston Hubert McIntosh), and [[Bunny Wailer]] (Neville Livingston).\n\nDuring 1970 and 1971, Wailer, Marley and Tosh worked with renowned reggae producers [[Leslie Kong]] and [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]].\n\nBefore signing to [[Island Records]] in 1972, the band released four albums. Two additional albums were produced before Tosh and Wailer departed from the band in 1974, citing dissatisfaction with their treatment by the label and ideological disagreements. Marley continued with a new lineup, which included the I-Threes, and went on to release seven more albums. Marley  died from cancer in 1981, at which point the group disbanded.\n\nThe Wailers were a groundbreaking ska and reggae group, noted for songs such as \"Simmer Down\", \"Trenchtown Rock\", \"Nice Time\", \"[[War (Bob Marley song)|War]]\", \"[[Stir It Up]]\" and \"[[Get Up, Stand Up]]\".",
