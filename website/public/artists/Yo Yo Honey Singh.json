  "description": "'''Hirdesh \"Honey\" Singh''' (born 15 March 1983), known professionally as '''Yo Yo Honey Singh''', is an Indian [[singer]], [[rapper]] and [[record producer|music producer]]. Regarded as one of the most popular and influential artist/rap artist emerging from India, he is credited with popularizing [[hip-hop]] & [[rap]] with the mainstream Indian audience, taking the art pan-India. Singh commenced his career as a [[hip-hop]] [[record producer|music producer]] in 2003 with his underground album titled ''Desi By Nature'', subsequently working as a session and recording artist within the underground music scene until the release of his debut studio album, ''[[International Villager]]''. While much of his [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] work during the late 2000s and early 2010s made him a [[controversy|controversial figure]], he came to be a representation of voice of the Indian [[youth]].\n\nHirdesh's nickname growing up was \"Honey\". However, the origin of \"Yo Yo\" came from Singh picking up the slang from his African-American friends who too were hip-hop heads, which when translated, means \"aapka apna\" in [[Hindi]] or \"your very own\" in [[English language|English]]. This interpretation of the slang gave him a unique identity of \"aapka apna Honey Singh\" or \"your very own Honey Singh\". Singh stated that the idea behind the inclusion of the term was \"to establish an even deeper bond with his fans not only through his music and artistry, but also through the preface of his stage name indicating that at the end of the day, he also is one amongst the people and is the people's artist\".",
