  "name": "The Real Tuesday Weld",
  "description": "'''The Real Tuesday Weld''' is a British band formed in 2001 by lead singer and producer Stephen Coates, who studied at the [[Royal College of Art]]. They have released several albums, singles and EPs, and many tracks on compilations. Their combination of [[big-band]] [[Jazz Age|jazz era]] sounds with [[electronica]] and vintage-style animations has been influential on the current range of [[electro swing]] artists and DJs. Their live shows are usually accompanied by visuals in the form of bespoke films and animations.\n\nThe band is named after American film actress [[Tuesday Weld]]. Coates once had a dream involving Weld and 1930s vocalist [[Al Bowlly]] and cites it as inspiration for the band's particular style. (A German [[alternative rock|alternative]]/[[indie rock]] band by the name of Tuesday Weld, that released two albums and four singles in the 1990s, is not related.)\n\nCoates lives in [[Clerkenwell]], London. \"The Clerkenwell Kid\", often cited or credited as the band's producer/re-mixer, is an [[alter ego]] for Coates himself.  Their 2009 album ''The Clerkenwell Kid: Live at the End of the World'' is an imaginary live recording of a concert on the \"eve of the apocalypse\".  The Clerkenwell Kid is also the main character in a London-based mythology that Coates has developed around his love of the city's history and stories.\n\nIn early 2021 Coates announced on the band's website that the Real Tuesday Weld would be winding up \"in the next year or so\" after the release of three final albums â€“ ''Blood'' (released in May 2021), ''Dreams'' (released in September 2022) and ''Bone''.",
