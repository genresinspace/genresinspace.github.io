  "name": "Bintangs",
  "description": "The '''Bintangs''' are a Dutch rhythm and blues band. Founded in 1961 in [[Beverwijk]] as an [[indorock]] band, they soon began playing a rougher, rhythm and blues-inflected style. The band had a four-year hiatus in the 1980s but reunited and are still active. The band has gone through many members (in 1985 they were in their 33rd lineup), with Frank Kraaijeveld (bass and vocals) as a constant element. They scored one hit, in 1970, and though commercial success has eluded them nationally and internationally they remain a popular live act.",
