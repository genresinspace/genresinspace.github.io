  "description": "'''John Winston Ono Lennon'''{{refn|group=nb|Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on 22 April 1969, adding \"Ono\" as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon.{{sfn|Coleman|1984b|p=64}}}} (born '''John Winston Lennon'''; 9 October 1940{{snds}}8 December 1980) was an English singer-songwriter, musician and activist. He gained global fame as the founder, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Lennon's [[Lennonâ€“McCartney|songwriting partnership]] with [[Paul McCartney]] remains the most successful in history.\n\nBorn in [[Liverpool]], Lennon became involved in the [[Skiffle revival|skiffle craze]] as a teenager. In 1956, he formed [[the Quarrymen]], which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Lennon initially was the group's ''de facto'' leader, a role he gradually seemed to cede to McCartney, writing and co-writing songs with increasing innovation, including \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\", which he later cited as his finest work with the band. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including ''[[How I Won the War]]'', and authoring ''[[In His Own Write]]'' and ''[[A Spaniard in the Works]]'', both collections of [[literary nonsense|nonsense writings]] and line drawings. Starting with \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the [[anti-war movement]] and the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].\n\nIn 1969, he started the [[Plastic Ono Band]] with his second wife, multimedia artist [[Yoko Ono]], held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration [[bed-in]] for peace, and [[Break-up of the Beatles|left the Beatles]] to embark on a solo career. Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] albums and several more films. After the [[Break-up of the Beatles|Beatles disbanded]], Lennon released his solo debut ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]'' and the international top-10 singles \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", \"[[Instant Karma!]]\", \"[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]\", and \"[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]\". Moving to New York City in 1971, his [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|criticism of the Vietnam War]] resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the [[Nixon administration]]. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced [[Harry Nilsson]]'s album ''[[Pussy Cats]]''. He also had chart-topping collaborations with [[Elton John]] (\"[[Whatever Gets You thru the Night]]\") and [[David Bowie]] (\"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\"). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. He was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] by [[Mark David Chapman]], three weeks after the album's release.\n\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. ''Double Fantasy'', his second-best-selling non-Beatles album, won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. That year, he won the [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a [[BBC]] history poll of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]''. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th-[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|greatest artist of all time]]. He was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (in 1997) and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).",
