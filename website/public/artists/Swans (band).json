  "name": "Swans",
  "description": "'''Swans''' are an American [[experimental rock]] band formed in 1981 by singer, songwriter and [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Michael Gira]]. One of the few acts to emerge from the [[New York City]]–based [[no wave]] scene and stay intact into the next decade, Swans have become recognized for an ever-changing sound, exploring genres such as [[noise rock]], [[post-punk]], [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[post-rock]]. Initially, their music was known for its sonic brutality and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] lyrics. Following the addition of singer, songwriter and keyboardist [[Jarboe]] in 1986, Swans began to incorporate melody and intricacy into their music. Jarboe remained the band's only constant member with Gira and semi-constant guitarist [[Norman Westberg]] until their dissolution in 1997.\n\nIn 2010, Gira re-formed the band without Jarboe, establishing a stable lineup of musicians which toured worldwide and released several albums to critical acclaim. This iteration of the group performed its last shows in November 2017, ending the tour in support of its then most recent album ''[[The Glowing Man]]''. Since 2019, Gira has been touring and recording with Swans as \"a revolving cast of contributors\". The band's latest album, ''[[Birthing (album)|Birthing]]'', was released on May 30, 2025. Since 1990, all Swans records have been released through Gira's own label, [[Young God Records]].",
