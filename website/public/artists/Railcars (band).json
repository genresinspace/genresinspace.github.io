  "description": "'''Railcars''' is an American, [[San Francisco]]-based [[shitgaze]] project of Aria C Jalali. For the project's initial release, Jalali teamed up with [[Xiu Xiu]] front man [[Jamie Stewart (American musician)|Jamie Stewart]] to produce his follow up EP \"Cities vs Submarines\" in 2008 (released on Gold Robot Records). Jalali has said he will not be teaming with Stewart again to produce his next album, ''Cathedral With No Eyes'', due to logistical reasons, namely Stewart's move to North Carolina. Railcars' music is described as having \"pastel-coloured vocals suitably warped, but with a low-cut frenetic backdrop surrounding them.\"",
