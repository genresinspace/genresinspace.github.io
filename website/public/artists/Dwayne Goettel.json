He assisted bandmate [[cEvin Key]] on a number of side projects such as [[The Tear Garden]] and [[Doubting Thomas (band)|Doubting Thomas]], and helped form the experimental electronic group [[Download (band)|Download]]. He also created the independent record label [[Subconscious Communications]] with friend and colleague [[Phil Western]] as a means to release his solo work.\n\nIn 1993, Skinny Puppy moved to [[Los Angeles]] to produce their eighth studio album, ''[[The Process (Skinny Puppy album)|The Process]]'', through [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]]. The production was marred by rampant drug use and band infighting, and ultimately halted in 1995 when vocalist [[Nivek Ogre]] quit the band. Goettel and Key, in an attempt to salvage the album, returned to Canada with the [[master tapes]]. Goettel went into rehab for his drug addictions and returned to live with his parents in Edmonton. On August 23, 1995, Goettel was found dead at the age of 31 in his parents' home; he had died from a [[heroin]] overdose. ''The Process'' was eventually completed and released in his memory.",
