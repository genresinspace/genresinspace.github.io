  "description": "'''Burt Freeman Bacharach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|ər|æ|k}} {{respell|BAK|ə-rak}}; May 12, 1928&nbsp;– February 8, 2023) was an American composer, songwriter, record producer, and pianist who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures of 20th-century [[popular music]]. Starting in the 1950s, he composed hundreds of pop songs, many in collaboration with lyricist [[Hal David]]. Bacharach's music is characterized by unusual [[chord progression]]s and [[time signature]] changes, influenced by his background in [[jazz]], and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.\n\nMore than 1,000 different artists have recorded Bacharach's songs. From 1961 to 1972, most of Bacharach and David's hits were written specifically for and performed by [[Dionne Warwick]], but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]]. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach wrote hits for singers such as [[Gene Pitney]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[B. J. Thomas]].\n\nBacharach wrote fifty-two US [[Top 40]] hits. Those that topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] include \"[[This Guy's in Love with You]]\" ([[Herb Alpert]], 1968), \"[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]\" (Thomas, 1969), \"[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]\" ([[the Carpenters]], 1970), \"[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]\" ([[Christopher Cross]], 1981), \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" (Warwick, 1986), and \"[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]\" ([[Carole Bayer Sager]], 1986). His accolades include six [[Grammy Awards]], three [[Academy Awards]], and one [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]].\n\nBacharach is described by writer [[William Farina]] as \"a composer whose venerable name can be linked with just about every other prominent musical artist of his era\"; in later years, his songs were newly appropriated for the soundtracks of major feature films, by which time \"tributes, compilations, and revivals were to be found everywhere\".{{sfn|Farina|2013|p=144}} A significant figure in [[easy listening]],{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=176}} he influenced later musical movements such as [[chamber pop]] and ''[[Shibuya-kei]]''. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|\"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\"]]. In 2012, the duo received the [[Library of Congress]] [[Gershwin Prize]] for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.",
