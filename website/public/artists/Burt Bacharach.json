He composed hundreds of pop songs, many in collaboration with lyricist [[Hal David]]. His music features atypical [[chord progression]]s and [[time signature]] changes, influenced by his background in [[jazz]], and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Bacharach and David worked with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]]. From 1961 to 1972, most of the duo's hits were tailored for [[Dionne Warwick]]. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach wrote hits for singers such as [[Gene Pitney]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[B. J. Thomas]]. In total, he wrote fifty-two US [[Top 40]] hits, including chart-toppers \"[[This Guy's in Love with You]]\" ([[Herb Alpert]], 1968), \"[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]\" (Thomas, 1969), \"[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]\" ([[the Carpenters]], 1970), \"[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]\" ([[Christopher Cross]], 1981), \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" (Warwick, 1986), and \"[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]\" ([[Carole Bayer Sager]], 1986).\n\nOver 1,000 artists have recorded Bacharach's songs. A significant figure in [[orchestral pop]] and [[easy listening]],{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=176}} he influenced genres such as [[sunshine pop]]/[[soft rock]], [[chamber pop]], and ''[[Shibuya-kei]]''. Writer [[William Farina]] described him as \"linked with just about every other prominent musical artist of his era\"; later his songs were repurposed for major feature film soundtracks, by which time \"tributes, compilations, and revivals\" had proliferated.{{sfn|Farina|2013|p=144}}  He received six [[Grammy Awards]], three [[Academy Awards]], and one [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy Award]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|\"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\"]]. In 2012, the duo received the [[Library of Congress]] [[Gershwin Prize]] for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.",
