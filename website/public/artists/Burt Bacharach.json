  "description": "'''Burt Freeman Bacharach''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|k|ər|æ|k}} {{respell|BAK|ə-rak}}; May 12, 1928&nbsp;– February 8, 2023) was an American composer, songwriter, record producer, and pianist, widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures of 20th-century [[popular music]]. He composed hundreds of pop songs, many in collaboration with lyricist [[Hal David]]. His music features atypical [[chord progression]]s and [[time signature]] changes, influenced by his background in [[jazz]], and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Bacharach and David worked with [[Marty Robbins]], [[Perry Como]], [[Gene McDaniels]], and [[Jerry Butler]]. From 1961 to 1972, most of the duo's hits were tailored for [[Dionne Warwick]]. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach wrote hits for singers such as [[Gene Pitney]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and [[B. J. Thomas]]. In total, he wrote fifty-two US [[Top 40]] hits, including chart-toppers \"[[This Guy's in Love with You]]\" ([[Herb Alpert]], 1968), \"[[Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head]]\" (Thomas, 1969), \"[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]\" ([[the Carpenters]], 1970), \"[[Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)]]\" ([[Christopher Cross]], 1981), \"[[That's What Friends Are For]]\" (Warwick, 1986), and \"[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]\" ([[Carole Bayer Sager]], 1986).\n\nOver 1,000 artists have recorded Bacharach's songs. A significant figure in [[orchestral pop]] and [[easy listening]], he influenced genres such as [[sunshine pop]]/[[soft rock]], [[chamber pop]], and ''[[Shibuya-kei]]''.{{efn|Attributed to multiple references: <ref name=\"LLC2006\" />{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=176}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Stanley |first=Bob |author-link=Bob Stanley (musician) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9emZAAAAQBAJ |title=Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop |date=2013 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=978-0-571-28198-5 |pages=179–181}}</ref><ref name=\"am chamberpop\">{{cite web |title=Chamber pop |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/chamber-pop-ma0000012300 |work=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Lindsay |first=Cam |title=Return to the Planet of Cornelius |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/return-to-the-planet-of-cornelius/ |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |date=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"am shibuya\">{{cite web |title=Shibuya-Kei |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/shibuya-kei-ma0000011840 |work=AllMusic}}</ref>}} The writer [[William Farina]] said that Bacharach was connected in some way to almost every prominent musical artist of his era.

In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|\"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\"]]. In 2012, the duo received the [[Library of Congress]] [[Gershwin Prize]] for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.",
