  "name": "The Dolly Rockers",
  "description": "'''The Dolly Rockers''' were an English [[girl group]] from [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]]. The group's final line-up consisted of Lucie Kay, Sophie King and Brooke Challinor. They first became known when they competed in the [[The X Factor (British series 3)|third series]] of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2006. In 2009, their song \"Je Suis une Dolly\" received an unexpected amount of airplay, receiving coverage in British tabloids and feuding with other pop groups. They were signed with [[EMI]] [[Parlophone]], and worked with hit songwriters [[Ray Hedges]] and Nigel Butler. Their sound has been called \"[[wonky pop]]\" and \"drunk disco\", and they have described themselves as \"the pop equivalent of [[Marmite]].\"\n\nThe Dolly Rockers re-auditioned for ''The X Factor'' in 2013, but failed to get to bootcamp. On 10 October 2013, the group confirmed that after their failed ''X Factor'' audition, they had decided to go their separate ways after seven years together.",
