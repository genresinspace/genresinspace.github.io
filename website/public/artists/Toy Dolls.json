  "description": "The '''Toy Dolls''' are an English [[punk rock]] band formed in 1979. They are best known for their sole UK hit, a punk-rock cover of \"[[Nellie the Elephant]]\". The Toy Dolls' songs expressed a sense of fun, such as \"Yul Brynner Was a Skinhead\", \"My Girlfriend's Dad's a Vicar\" and \"James Bond Lives Down Our Street\", and songs titles often use [[alliteration]], such as \"Peter Practice's Practice Place\", \"Fisticuffs in Frederick Street\", \"Neville Is a Nerd\", and \"Quick to Quit the Quentin\".\n\nTheir albums usually include a [[cover version]] of a well-known hit song, usually sped up to the usual punk rock tempo. Covers have included \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\", \"[[Toccata and Fugue in D Minor|Toccata in Dm]]\", \"[[No Particular Place to Go]]\", \"[[Sabre Dance]]\", \"[[Livin' La Vida Loca]]\", \"[[Lazy Sunday (Small Faces song)|Lazy Sunday]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\", \"[[She's So Modern]]\" and \"[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]\". They have also recorded [[Parody|parodies]] of popular songs, such as \"[[Kids in America|The Kids in Tyne and Wear (Kids in America)]]\" and \"[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia|The Devil Went Down to Scunthorpe (The Devil Went Down to Georgia)]]\". Their albums often start with a short intro with a catchy guitar [[riff]], and end with an outro, which is usually a slightly longer variation of the intro riff. [[Kazoo]]s are also prominent in many of their songs.\n\nMost of the band members have nicknames, and are rarely seen without their cartoonish rectangular sunglasses (although they appeared bare-eyed on the ''One More Megabyte'' [[album cover]]).",
