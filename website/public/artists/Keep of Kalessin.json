They released two albums under this lineup: ''[[Through Times of War (album)|Through Times of War]]'' in 1997, and ''[[Agnen: A Journey Through the Dark]]'' in 1999, before splitting up.

In 2006, he reconstituted the group with a new lineup and released a third full-length, ''[[Armada (album)|Armada]]''. They toured with [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]] and [[Dimmu Borgir]] early in 2008. Their fourth album ''[[Kolossus (album)|Kolossus]]'' was released on 6 June 2008.

Keep of Kalessin was nominated for a [[Spellemannprisen]] in the [[heavy metal music|metal]] category in 2008.",
