He is known for his [[socialist]] leanings and disapproval of Bulgaria's [[prime minister]] [[Boiko Borisov]]. One of the country's top rap artists in the 1990s and the early 2000s, his career has been waning ever since his partner, Ivan Glavchev (Vanko 1), was sentenced in 2003 to 12 years in prison for running an organization that exported Bulgarian prostitutes, including minors, to France, Spain, Belgium and Italy. He openly supported Bulgaria's last socialist-led government, whose decision to appoint a media tycoon known for his links to organized crime as head of the national security agency sparked [[Protests against the Oresharski cabinet|nationwide protests against the Oresharski cabinet]]. He also provoked indignation by calling Bulgaria's former Finance Minister, [[Simeon Dyankov]], \"Jewish scum\" in 2013.
