At the age of 6, he took a cello and decided that would be the instrument he would play all his life. Like fellow band members [[Perttu Kivilaakso]] and [[Eicca Toppinen]], he attended [[Sibelius Academy]] in Helsinki.\n\n20 years later, Paavo got his \"Solist Cellist\" diploma at the Sibelius Academy, and shortly after began to work as a cello teacher in music schools. He played in the \"Finnish National Opera\" as well. He plays a Gulbrandt Enger cello (1882) with a R. [[Wainio]] bow.\n\nApart from his work with Apocalyptica, he is a cello teacher and a skiing instructor. He also enjoys [[parachuting|sky-diving]], windsurfing, and water skiing.",
