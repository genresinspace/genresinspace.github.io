  "description": "'''McKinley Morganfield''' (April 4, 1913{{snd}}April 30, 1983),{{sfn|Gordon|2002|pp=4–5}} better known as '''Muddy Waters''', was an American [[blues]] [[singer-songwriter]] and musician who was an important figure in the post-World War II blues scene, and is often cited as the \"father of modern [[Chicago blues]]\". His style of playing has been described as \"raining down [[Mississippi Delta|Delta]] beatitude\".\n\nMuddy Waters grew up on [[Stovall, Mississippi|Stovall Plantation]] near [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]], and by age 17 was playing the guitar and the [[harmonica]], copying local blues artists [[Son House]] and [[Robert Johnson]]. In 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] and Professor [[John W. Work III]] of [[Fisk University]] recorded him in Mississippi for the [[Library of Congress]]. In 1943, he moved to Chicago to become a full-time professional musician. In 1946, he recorded his first records for [[Columbia Records]] and then for [[Aristocrat Records]], a newly formed label run by brothers [[Leonard Chess|Leonard]] and [[Phil Chess]].\n\nIn the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band—[[Little Walter Jacobs]] on harmonica, [[Jimmy Rogers]] on guitar, [[Elga Edmonds]] (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and [[Otis Spann]] on piano—recorded several songs that became blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter [[Willie Dixon]]. These songs included \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]],\" \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\" and \"[[I'm Ready (Muddy Waters song)|I'm Ready]]\". In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the  blues there. His performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, ''[[At Newport 1960]]''.\n\nMuddy Waters' music has influenced various [[Music of the United States|American music]] genres, including [[rock and roll]] and subsequently [[Rock music|rock]].",
