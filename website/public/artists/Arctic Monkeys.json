  "description": "'''Arctic Monkeys''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sheffield]] in 2002. They comprise lead singer and guitarist [[Alex Turner]], drummer [[Matt Helders]], guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O'Malley, who replaced co-founder and original bassist [[Andy Nicholson]] in 2006. Though initially associated with the short-lived [[landfill indie]] movement, Arctic Monkeys were one of the earliest bands to come to public attention via the [[Internet]], during the emerging \"[[blog rock]]\" era. Commentators have suggested that this period marked a shift in how new bands were promoted and marketed.\n\nTheir debut album, ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]'' (2006), received acclaim and topped the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history at the time. It won [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|Best British Album]] at the [[2007 Brit Awards]] and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. The band's second album, ''[[Favourite Worst Nightmare]]'' (2007), was also acclaimed and won Best British Album at the [[2008 BRIT Awards|2008 Brit Awards]]. ''[[Humbug (album)|Humbug]]'' (2009) and ''[[Suck It and See]]'' (2011) received positive but weaker reviews.\n\nThe band achieved wider international fame with their acclaimed fifth album ''[[AM (Arctic Monkeys album)|AM]]'' (2013), which was supported by the global hit \"[[Do I Wanna Know?]]\". ''AM'' topped four [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts and was certified [[RIAA certification|4× Platinum]] in the US. At the [[2014 BRIT Awards|2014 Brit Awards]], it became the third Arctic Monkeys album to win [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]]. Their sixth album, ''[[Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino]]'' (2018), departed from the band's guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. Their seventh album, ''[[The Car (album)|The Car]]'' (2022), received nominations for the [[Ivor Novello Awards]] and the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2023. It was their third album nominated for a [[Best Alternative Music Album|Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album]], and their second consecutive nomination after ''Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino''.\n\nArctic Monkeys' sales in the US alone stand at over 30 million units, according to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In the United Kingdom, they became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums. They have won seven [[Brit Awards]], winning [[BRIT Award for British Group|Best British Group]] and [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]] three times, becoming the first band to ever \"do the double\"—that is, win in both categories—three times; a [[Mercury Prize]] for ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not''; an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] and 20 [[NME Awards]]. They have been nominated for nine [[Grammy Award]]s, and received Mercury Prize nominations in 2007, 2013, 2018 and 2023. Both ''Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not'' and ''AM'' are included in ''[[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|NME]]'' and different editions of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s lists of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\".",
