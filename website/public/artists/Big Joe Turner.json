  "description": "'''Joseph Vernon''' \"'''Big Joe'''\" '''Turner Jr.''' (May 18, 1911 &ndash; November 24, 1985) was an American [[blues shouter]] from [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. According to songwriter [[Doc Pomus]], \"[[Rock and roll]] would have never happened without him\". Turner's greatest fame was due to his rock and roll recordings in the 1950s, particularly \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\", but his career as a performer endured from the 1920s into the 1980s.\n\nTurner was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, with the Hall lauding him as \"the brawny voiced 'Boss of the Blues{{'\"}}. [[AllMusic]] called Turner \"the premier blues shouter of the postwar era\".",
