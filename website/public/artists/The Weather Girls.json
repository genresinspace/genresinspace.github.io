After several years of singing background for Sylvester, the duo was signed in 1979 to [[Fantasy Records]] as Two Tons O' Fun. The duo changed their name to The Weather Girls and were launched into somewhat more mainstream recognition following the release of the single, \"[[It's Raining Men]]\" (1982), which became their first number-one song on the US [[Dance Club Songs|Dance Chart]] and their biggest hit. Despite having several hit songs on the Dance Chart as Two Tons O' Fun and The Weather Girls, the duo never achieved a top 40 hit on the main US [[Hot 100]] and ultimately disbanded in 1988 after the release of their self-titled fifth album ''The Weather Girls''.\n\nIn 1991, Armstead reformed the duo with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes. Over the course of a decade, the Armstead and Rhodes released three albums: ''Double Tons of Fun'' (1993), ''Think Big!'', and ''Puttin' On the Hits'' (1999). In 2004, Armstead died due to heart failure and was replaced with singer Ingrid Arthur. Following the release of two albums ''Totally Wild!'' (2004) and ''The Woman I Am'' (2009), Arthur left the group and was replaced with singer Dorrey Lin Lyles in 2012.\n\nAs the Weather Girls with Martha Wash and Izora Armstead, the duo received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] in 1984.",
