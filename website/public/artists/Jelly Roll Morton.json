  "description": "'''Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe''' ({{ne}} '''Lemott''', later '''Morton'''; c. September 20, 1890 – July 10, 1941), known professionally as '''Jelly Roll Morton''', was an American [[blues]] and [[jazz]] pianist, bandleader, and composer of [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] descent. Morton was jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential characteristics when notated. His composition \"[[Jelly Roll Blues]]\", published in 1915, was one of the first published jazz compositions. He also claimed to have invented the genre.\n\nMorton also wrote \"[[King Porter Stomp]]\", \"[[Wolverine Blues (song)|Wolverine Blues]]\", \"[[Black Bottom Stomp]]\", and \"I Thought I Heard [[Buddy Bolden]] Say\", the last being a tribute to [[Music of New Orleans|New Orleans musicians]] from the turn of the 20th century.\n\nMorton's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 was criticized. Music critic [[Scott Yanow]] wrote, \"Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth ... Morton's accomplishments as an early innovator are so vast that he did not really need to stretch the truth.\" [[Gunther Schuller]] says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation.”",
