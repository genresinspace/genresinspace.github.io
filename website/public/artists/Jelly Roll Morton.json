  "description": "'''Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe''' ({{ne}} '''Lemott''', later '''Morton'''; c. September 20, 1890 – July 10, 1941), known professionally as '''Jelly Roll Morton''', was an American [[blues]] and [[jazz]] pianist, bandleader, and composer of [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] descent. Morton was jazz's first arranger, proving that a genre rooted in improvisation could retain its essential characteristics when notated. His composition \"[[Jelly Roll Blues]]\", published in 1915, was one of the first published jazz compositions. He also claimed to have invented the genre.\n\nMorton also wrote \"[[King Porter Stomp]]\", \"[[Wolverine Blues (song)|Wolverine Blues]]\", \"[[Black Bottom Stomp]]\", and \"I Thought I Heard [[Buddy Bolden]] Say\", the last being a tribute to [[Music of New Orleans|New Orleans musicians]] from the turn of the 20th century.\n\nMorton's claim to have invented jazz in 1902 was criticized. Music critic [[Scott Yanow]] wrote, \"Jelly Roll Morton did himself a lot of harm posthumously by exaggerating his worth ... Morton's accomplishments as an early innovator are so vast that he did not really need to stretch the truth.\" On the other hand, [[Gunther Schuller]] says of Morton's \"hyperbolic assertions\" that there is \"no proof to the contrary\" and that Morton's \"considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation.”",
