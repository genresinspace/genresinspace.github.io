Their music fuses sounds from South America and the [[Caribbean]] with [[Soul music|soul]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and pop.\n\nIn addition to public performances, LADAMA holds educational workshops in English, Spanish, and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], where they hope to provide a foundation for participants to \"use music as a basic form of personal expression to address issues pertinent to them.\" LADAMA continues to perform and offer workshops at venues and festivals around the world. LADAMA seeks to empower primarily women and youth (but everyone is welcome) through these interactive musical experiences.",
