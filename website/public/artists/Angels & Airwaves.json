  "description": "'''Angels & Airwaves''' (also written as '''Angels and Airwaves'''; stylized and abbreviated as '''ΛVΛ''') is an American rock band, comprising lead vocalist/guitarist [[Tom DeLonge]], guitarist David Kennedy, drummer [[Ilan Rubin]], and bassist Matt Rubano.\n\nThe band formed after [[Blink-182]] went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record even after Blink-182 reunited in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with the band again in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. To date, the band has released six studio albums: ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]'' (2006), ''[[I-Empire]]'' (2007), ''[[Love (Angels & Airwaves album)|Love]]'' (2010), ''[[Love: Part Two]]'' (2011), ''[[The Dream Walker]]'' (2014) and ''[[Lifeforms (Angels & Airwaves album)|Lifeforms]]'' (2021). The project also resulted in the documentary film ''[[Start the Machine (film)|Start the Machine]]'' (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two ''Love'' albums, the group scored and produced the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Love (2011 film)|Love]]'' by director [[William Eubank]] in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, [[Angels & Airwaves Presents Love Live|Love Live]]. The band released an animated short named ''[[Poet Anderson: The Dream Walker]]'' and their fifth album, ''The Dream Walker'', on December 9, 2014. Other related media, such as comic books and a live-action film, followed in 2015.\n\nThe group has been described by DeLonge as more than a band, but more accurately \"an [[Art group|art project]] [that approaches] larger [[Theme (literature)|human themes]] and tackles them in different [[means of communication|mediums]]\", or simply \"a multimedia project\". This has been seen in the group's films, live events, and novel approach to fan-artist interaction.\n\nOf the first two albums, the band says that they were mainly influenced by the music of [[Radiohead]] and [[Pink Floyd]], combining them with the grandiosity of [[U2]].",
