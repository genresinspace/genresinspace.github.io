  "description": "'''Enigma''' is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer [[Michael Cretu]]. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborating with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]], before he conceived the idea of a [[New-age music|new-age]], [[worldbeat]] project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]'' (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and [[Frank Peterson]]. The album remains Enigma's most successful, helped by the international hit single \"[[Sadeness (Part I)]]\", which sold 12 million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey \"the old rules and habits\" and presented a new form of artistic expression with a return to mysticism.\n\nEnigma followed ''MCMXC a.D.'' with a series of albums that involved different musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was ''[[The Cross of Changes]]'' (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over eight million copies worldwide, followed by ''[[Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!]]'' (1996), which blended the [[Gregorian chant]]s reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album, ''[[The Screen Behind the Mirror]]'' (2000), started a slight departure from the previous [[world music]] themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with ''[[Voyageur (Enigma album)|Voyageur]]'' (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and ''[[A Posteriori]]'' (2006), a work inspired by the future [[Andromedaâ€“Milky Way collision|collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies]], with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to ''Voyageur'' than earlier releases. ''[[Seven Lives Many Faces]]'' (2008) followed and contained a mixture of [[Classical music|classical]] and modern elements, ranging from ethnic chants to [[rap]] and [[dubstep]] influences. Enigma's eighth album, ''[[The Fall of a Rebel Angel]]'', was released in November 2016.\n\nThe project has sold over 8.5 million [[RIAA]]-certified albums in the US and an estimated 70 million worldwide, with over 100 gold and platinum certifications. It has also received two [[Grammy Award]] nominations.",
