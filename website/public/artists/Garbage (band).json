  "name": "Garbage",
  "description": "'''Garbage''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1993 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. The band's line-up consisting of Scottish musician [[Shirley Manson]] (vocals) and American musicians [[Duke Erikson]] (guitar, bass, keyboards), [[Steve Marker]] (guitar, keyboards), and [[Butch Vig]] (drums, percussion) has remained unchanged since its inception. All four members are involved in songwriting and production. Garbage has sold over 17 million albums worldwide.\n\nThe band's 1995 [[Garbage (album)|eponymous debut album]] was critically acclaimed, selling over four million copies and achieving [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] certification in the UK, the US, and Australia. It was accompanied by a string of increasingly successful [[single (music)|singles]], including \"[[Stupid Girl (Garbage song)|Stupid Girl]]\" and \"[[Only Happy When It Rains]]\". Follow-up ''[[Version 2.0]]'' (1998) was equally successful, topping the [[UK Albums Chart]] and receiving two [[Grammy Award]] nominations. The band followed this by performing and co-producing [[The World Is Not Enough (song)|the theme song]] to the 19th [[James Bond]] film ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999). Their third album ''[[Beautiful Garbage]]'' (2001) was also critically praised, but failed to match the commercial success of its predecessors, despite selling over a million copies in its first three months. \n\nGarbage quietly disbanded amidst the troubled production of their fourth album ''[[Bleed Like Me]]'' (2005), but regrouped to complete the album, which peaked at a career-high number four in the US. The band cut short their ''Bleed Like Me'' concert tour and announced an indefinite hiatus to pursue separate interests. It was briefly interrupted in 2007, when they recorded new tracks for their [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Absolute Garbage]]''. The band reunited in 2011, and self-released their fifth album, ''[[Not Your Kind of People]]'' (2012), on their own label Stunvolume to positive reviews. They followed it with ''[[Strange Little Birds]]'' (2016) and ''[[No Gods No Masters (Garbage album)|No Gods No Masters]]'' (2021). The band's eighth studio album, ''[[Let All That We Imagine Be the Light]]'', was released on May 30, 2025.",
