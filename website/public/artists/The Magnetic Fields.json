  "description": "'''The Magnetic Fields''' are an American [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] founded and led by [[Stephin Merritt]]. Merritt is the group's primary songwriter, producer, and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The band is named after the [[André Breton]]/[[Philippe Soupault]] novel ''[[Les Champs Magnétiques]]''.\n\nThe band released their debut single \"[[100,000 Fireflies]]\" in 1991. The single was typical of the band's earlier career, characterized by [[synthesizer|synthesized]] instrumentation by Merritt, with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself, from the ''[[The House of Tomorrow (album)|House of Tomorrow]]'' EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized; it is now composed of Merritt, [[Claudia Gonson]], [[Sam Davol]], and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by [[Shirley Simms]]. The band's best-known work is the 1999 three-volume concept album ''[[69 Love Songs]]''. It was followed in the succeeding years by a \"no-synth\" trilogy: ''[[i (The Magnetic Fields album)|i]]'' (2004), ''[[Distortion (The Magnetic Fields album)|Distortion]]'' (2008), and ''[[Realism (The Magnetic Fields album)|Realism]]'' (2010). The band's latest album, ''[[Quickies (album)|Quickies]]'', was released on May 29, 2020.",
