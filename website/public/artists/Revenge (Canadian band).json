  "description": "'''Revenge''' is a Canadian [[war metal]] band formed in 2000 by James Read following the collapse of his previous outfit Conqueror. Revenge's chaotic black metal sound represents a direct continuation of Read's previous band's direction. Although often referred to as war metal, the band has rejected the term, instead calling themselves black metal, chaotic black metal, or [[blackened death metal|black death metal]]. They have released seven full-length albums to date. The band's lyrics explore various militant themes of [[antireligion|anti-religion]], [[misanthropy]], self-ascension, and the collapse and rebuilding of mankind.",
