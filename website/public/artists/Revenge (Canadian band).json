  "description": "'''Revenge''' is a Canadian [[war metal]] band formed in 2000 by James Read following the collapse of his previous outfit Conqueror. Revenge's chaotic black metal sound represents a direct continuation of Read's previous band's direction. Although sometimes referred to as war metal the band has never referred to themselves as war metal and has always called themselves black metal, chaotic black metal, or [[blackened death metal|black death metal]]. They have released seven full-length albums to date. The band's lyrics explore various militant themes of [[antireligion|anti-religion]], [[misanthropy]], self-ascension, and the collapse and rebuilding of mankind.",
