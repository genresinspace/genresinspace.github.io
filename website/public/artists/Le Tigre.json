  "name": "Le Tigre",
  "description": "'''Le Tigre''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|_|ˈ|t|iː|ɡ|r|ə}}, {{IPA|fr|lə tiɡʁ}}; French for \"The Tiger\") is an American [[art punk]] and [[riot grrrl]] band formed by [[Kathleen Hanna]] (of [[Bikini Kill]]), [[Johanna Fateman]] and [[Sadie Benning]] in 1998 in New York City. Benning left in 2000 and was replaced by [[JD Samson]]. They mixed [[Punk rock|punk]]'s directness and politics with playful samples, eclectic pop, and [[lo-fi (audio)|lo-fi]] electronics. Like with many bands in and from the [[riot grrrl]] movement, many of the lyrics addressed [[Feminism|feminist]] themes and ideas. The group also added multimedia and performance art elements to their live shows, which often featured support from like-minded acts such as [[the Need]].\n\nThe band released three full-length albums and toured extensively until 2007, when they announced a hiatus due to exhaustion. After a series of brief reunions to work with artists like [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Pussy Riot]], the band reunited in 2023 for a largely sold out tour of Europe and North America. They have been the subject of several controversies, including criticism for their participation in the trans-exclusionary [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] in the early 2000s, and a 2021 copyright infringement lawsuit targeting their most popular song, \"Deceptacon\" (1999).",
