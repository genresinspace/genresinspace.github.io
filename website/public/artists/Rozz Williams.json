  "name": "Rozz Williams",
  "description": "'''Rozz Williams''' (born '''Roger Alan Painter'''; November 6, 1963 â€“ April 1, 1998) was an American singer and songwriter known for his work with the bands [[Christian Death]], [[Shadow Project]] (with musician [[Eva O]]), and the [[Industrial music|industrial]] project [[Premature Ejaculation (band)|Premature Ejaculation]]. Christian Death is cited by some as a pioneer of the American [[gothic rock]] scene as well as [[deathrock]], and is considered to be one of the most influential figures of the scene. However, Williams disliked the \"[[Goth subculture|goth]]\" label and actively worked to shed it during the 1980s and 1990s by focusing on [[punk rock]], [[hard rock]], [[cabaret]], and [[spoken word]] music. Williams was also involved with his groups Daucus Karota, Heltir, EXP, Bloodflag, and his own version of Christian Death (Christian Death featuring Rozz Williams), along with recording a handful of solo albums. In addition to music, Williams was also an avid painter, poet, and collage artist.\n\nWilliams died by suicide on April 1, 1998. He was 34 years old.",
