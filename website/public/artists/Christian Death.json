  "name": "Christian Death",
  "description": "'''Christian Death''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles County, California]], in 1979 by [[Rozz Williams]]. With major line-up changes over the years, Christian Death has retained \"a relentlessly confrontational stand against [[organized religion]] and conventional morality\".\n\nWilliams was eventually joined by guitarist [[Rikk Agnew]] of the band [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]], James McGearty on bass guitar and George Belanger on drums. This line-up was responsible for producing the band's best known work, their 1982 debut studio album ''[[Only Theatre of Pain]]'', which was highly influential in the development of the style of music known as [[deathrock]], as well as on the American [[Gothic rock|gothic]] scene which also produced bands such as [[Kommunity FK]] and [[45 Grave]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''Only Theatre of Pain'', Christian Death's line-up fell apart, and by the time of the band's second studio album, ''[[Catastrophe Ballet]]'' (1984), Rozz had been joined by [[Valor Kand]] of tour mates [[Pompeii 99]] on vocals and guitar. Following the release of the band's third studio album, ''Ashes'', in 1985, Williams left the band and Kand became frontperson, with no original members of the band remaining. This resulted in a divide in the band's fanbase and created controversy that has continued to this day.",
