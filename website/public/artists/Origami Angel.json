  "description": "'''Origami Angel''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Washington D.C.]], consisting of singer and guitarist Ryland Heagy and drummer Pat Doherty. The duo formed the band in 2016 after the demise of a common prior band, and released a series of EPs leading up to their debut studio album, ''[[Somewhere City]]'' in 2019. The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] limited the ability to tour in support of the album, so they instead focused on recording material written during the prior sessions to release their second studio album, ''[[Gami Gang]]'' in 2021, and wrote and recorded further material for a series of smaller releases, including a [[mixtape]], ''[[The Brightest Days]]'', released in 2023. A third studio album, ''[[Feeling Not Found]]'', was released on September 27, 2024.",
