[[Sigurd Wongraven|Satyr]] and [[Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad|Frost]] have been the band's core members since 1993, and its only official members since 1997. The band's first three albums typify the [[early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]] style. Since its fourth album in 1999, the band has strayed from this style and included elements of [[heavy metal music|traditional heavy metal]] in their sound. Satyricon was the first Norwegian black metal band to join a multi-national record label ([[EMI]]).",
