''[[Sheer Heart Attack]]'' later that year and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", which topped the [[UK singles chart]] for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format. The band's 1977 album ''[[News of the World (album)|News of the World]]'' contained \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", which have become [[Stadium anthem|anthem]]s at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" from ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'' (1980) became their best-selling single, and their 1981 compilation album ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK]] and is certified [[RIAA certification|9x Platinum]] in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).

One more album was released featuring Mercury's vocals, 1995's ''[[Made in Heaven]]''. Deacon retired in 1997, while May and Taylor continued to make sporadic appearances together. Since 2004, they have toured as \"Queen +\", with vocalists [[Paul Rodgers]] and [[Adam Lambert]].\n\nQueen have been a global presence in popular culture for more than half a century.
