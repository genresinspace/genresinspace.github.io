  "description": "'''The Fireman''' was an English experimental music duo of [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Youth (musician and producer)|Youth]] formed in 1993. Their music catalogue ranges from [[Rock music|rock]] to [[electronica]], evolving over more than two decades and three albums. Although officially anonymous until 2008 with the release of the album ''[[Electric Arguments]]'', the group members' names had been known to the public since soon after the release of their first album.\n\nIn 1993, the Fireman released its first album, ''[[Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest]]'', and followed that with ''[[Rushes (album)|Rushes]]'' in 1998. In 2000, Youth also took part in McCartney's similarly styled ''[[Liverpool Sound Collage]]''. Their most recent album is ''[[Electric Arguments]]'' (2008).\n\nIn June 2008, McCartney's official website announced that a track called \"Lifelong Passion (Sail Away)\", from the album ''Electric Arguments'', would be issued as a limited-edition download to fans who donated to the charity [[Adopt-A-Minefield]]. The album was released on the label [[One Little Indian|One Little Independent]] on 24 November 2008. The new album features more traditional songs, in which there are vocals (the first time on any of their albums). The majority of the album's vocals come from McCartney. In February 2009, [[Sirius XM]] launched Fireman Radio, a limited-run channel dedicated to the music of the group.",
