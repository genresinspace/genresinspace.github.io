  "description": "'''The Gathering''' are a Dutch [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Oss]], [[North Brabant]] in 1989. The band's lineup currently consists of founding brothers [[René Rutten]] (guitars) and Hans Rutten (drums), [[Hugo Prinsen Geerligs]] (bass) and Frank Boeijen (keyboards), with former lead vocalist [[Anneke van Giersbergen]] currently a touring member.\n\nThe band's earliest releases were categorized as atmospheric [[doom metal]] with influences from [[extreme metal]] acts like [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Hellhammer]], undergoing numerous vocalist changes before breaking out in 1995 with [[Mandylion (album)|''Mandylion'']]. It was The Gathering's first album to feature lead singer [[Anneke van Giersbergen]] and the band's first to chart in the Netherlands. With van Giersbergen, the band's sound shifted from [[gothic metal]] to one influenced by [[shoegaze]], [[post-rock]] and [[trip hop]], starting with their fifth studio album ''[[How to Measure a Planet?]]'' in 1998.\n\nIn 2007, van Giersbergen left the group to focus on her new project [[Agua de Annique]]. Norwegian singer [[Silje Wergeland]] of the band [[Octavia Sperati]] was named her replacement in 2009, and their first album with her, [[The West Pole|''The West Pole'']], was released later that year. The band released three albums with Wergeland. Van Giersbergen toured with The Gathering in 2025 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ''Mandylion'', and Wergeland left the band at the end of the year.",
