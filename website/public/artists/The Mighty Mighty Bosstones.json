  "description": "'''The Mighty Mighty Bosstones''' (informally referred to as '''The Bosstones''' and often stylized as '''The Mighty Mighty BossToneS''') were an American [[ska punk]] band from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], formed in 1983. From the band's inception, lead vocalist [[Dicky Barrett]], bassist [[Joe Gittleman]], tenor saxophonist [[Tim Burton (musician)|Tim \"Johnny Vegas\" Burton]] and dancer (\"Bosstone\") Ben Carr remained constant members. The band's final line-up also included drummer [[Joe Sirois]], saxophonist Leon Silva, guitarist Lawrence Katz, keyboardist [[John Goetchius]], and trombonist [[Chris Rhodes]].\n\nThe Bosstones are often credited as one of the progenitors of the genre of [[ska punk]] and the creators of its subgenre ska-core, which mixes elements of [[ska]] with [[hardcore punk]]. Starting with the release of their 1989 debut ''[[Devil's Night Out]]'', the band toured and recorded extensively throughout the 1990s, becoming influential in the development of the American [[third-wave ska]] scene and was one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream. They reached their commercial peak with their [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling 1997 album ''[[Let's Face It]]'' and its hit single \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\". The band was also notable for being featured in the 1995 film ''[[Clueless]]'' as the frat party house band. The band had released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a hiatus in December 2003. In 2007, the Bosstones reunited to resume recording and touring, and  released four more studio albums between 2009 and 2021. From 1994 to 2002, and again from 2007 to 2019, they hosted the annual [[Hometown Throwdown]] music festival, held annually around Christmas time in Cambridge and later Boston.\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the band announced its disbandment.",
