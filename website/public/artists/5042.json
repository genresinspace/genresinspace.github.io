  "description": "'''Bastard Noise''' is an American [[noise (music)|noise]] band founded in 1991 by musicians Eric Wood, Henry Barnes, and W. T. Nelson. The project started as a type of sister band \nto the trio's previous group [[Man Is The Bastard]]. While Man Is the Bastard broke-up in late 1997, the Bastard Noise project continued and acts as Wood's current project.\n\nEarly recordings from the group's extensive discography were mostly self-released and predominantly featured only electronics and vocals. Since its formation, however, Bastard Noise have made releases with underground labels such as [[Three One G]], [[Relapse Records]], [[Gravity Records]], Deep Six, [[Vermiform Records]], [[Robotic Empire]], among others.\n\nDuring live performances, Wood often recruits other musicians to perform with him, the likes of which have included [[Merzbow]], [[Justin Pearson (musician)|Justin Pearson]], [[Keiji Haino]] and most recently Saira Huff. Instruments such as the [[bass guitar]] and the [[drum kit]] were later incorporated down the band's history. Wood has expressed distaste for digital distribution and prefers to release his music elusively on physical formats, although he has made few digital-only releases in the past.",
