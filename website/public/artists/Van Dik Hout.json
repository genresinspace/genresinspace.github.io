  "description": "'''Van Dik Hout''' are a Dutch [[pop music|pop group]] from [[Den Helder]] in the north of the Netherlands. They formed in the late 1980s as a school band, but moved later to [[Amsterdam]] where they rechristened themselves into Van Dik Hout.\n \nThe band's biggest hit was 'Stil in mij' (''Silent inside of me'') in 1994 from their first album 'Van Dik Hout', which became platinum in The Netherlands. With this hit, the band also won a [[MTV]] [[Local Hero Award]] and a [[Zilveren Harp]], a Dutch musical award. \n\nIn the early 2000s, they partnered with Dutch duo [[Acda en de Munnik]] to form the band ''De Poema's'', under which name they had a number one hit in 2001 with ''Zij maakt het verschil'' (''She makes the difference'').\n\nThe band's name (literally \"Of thick wood\") is a play on the Dutch saying \"Van dik hout zaagt men planken\", literally \"Planks get sawn from thick wood\". In Dutch it translates to \"The hard work has been done, albeit not very neatly\". It can also mean \"without much nuance\".",
