  "description": "'''Dion Francis DiMucci''' (born July 18, 1939), better known [[mononym]]ously as '''Dion''', is an American singer and songwriter. His music incorporates elements of [[doo-wop]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]]. Initially the lead singer of the vocal group [[Dion and the Belmonts]], Dion embarked on a solo career, and was one of the most prominent [[rock and roll]] performers of the pre-[[British Invasion]] era. He had 39 Top 40 hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a solo performer, or with [[the Belmonts]] and [[the Del-Satins]]. He is best remembered for his signature hit songs \"[[Runaround Sue]]\", \"[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]\", \"[[Ruby Baby]]\" and \"[[Lovers Who Wander (song)|Lovers Who Wander]]\", among others.\n\nDion continued making music after his popularity waned in 1964, and for the rest of the decade he diversified his style, fervently exploring country and urban blues, and recording electric folk rock. After a religious transformation in 1968, he resuscitated his commercial career with the major hit  \"[[Abraham, Martin and John]]\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, Dion produced [[#Mature and Christian music period (1969â€“1986)|several Christian albums]], winning a [[GMA Dove Award]] in 1984 for the album ''I Put Away My Idols''. He returned to [[secular music]] in the late 1980s with ''[[Yo Frankie (album)|Yo Frankie]]'' (1989). Between the mid-2000s and 2024, Dion released [[Dion DiMucci discography#Dion|seven chart-topping blues albums]] (three at No. 1). Critics who had dismissed his early work, labeling him as a [[teen idol]], praised his later work and noted the influence he has had on other musicians.\n\nA [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]]-nominated artist, Dion has released over 40 albums, and [[Dion DiMucci discography#Singles|scored eleven Top 10 hits]] (including with the Belmonts) on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.
