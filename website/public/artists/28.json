Taking their name from the [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]] and the \"state of mind\" the members shared, they released their debut album ''[[Newbuild (album)|Newbuild]]'' in September 1988. They secured commercial success in 1989, when their song \"[[Pacific State (song)|Pacific State]]\" was picked up by [[BBC Radio 1]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Gary Davies]] and charted for 11 weeks in the UK.\n\nThe group's early work influenced the UK's burgeoning [[acid house]] scene. [[AllMusic]] called them \"one of the most important [[dance music]] acts of all time,\" and noted their influence on subsequent [[techno]], [[intelligent dance music|IDM]], and [[alternative dance]] artists.",
