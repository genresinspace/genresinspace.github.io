  "name": "Muslimgauze",
  "description": "'''Muslimgauze''' was the main musical project of '''Bryn Jones''' (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British [[ethnic electronica]] and [[experimental music]]ian who was influenced by conflicts and history in the [[Muslim world]], often with an emphasis on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music has been described by one critic as \"among the most startling and unique in the [[noise music|noise]] underground.\"\n\nDespite his project name, Jones never converted to [[Islam]]. The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word ''[[muslin]]'' (a type of gauze) combined with ''Muslim'', referring to Jones' preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world.",
