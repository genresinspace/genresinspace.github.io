  "name": "Muslimgauze",
  "description": "'''Muslimgauze''' was the main musical project of '''Bryn Jones''' (17 June 1961 – 14 January 1999), a British [[experimental music]]ian who was influenced by conflicts and history in the [[Muslim world]], often with an emphasis on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. With dozens of albums released under the Muslimgauze name, Jones was prolific, but he never achieved mainstream success. His music, categorized as an example of [[ethnic electronica]], has been described by one critic as \"among the most startling and unique in the [[noise music|noise]] underground\".\n\nDespite his project name, Jones was not a [[Muslim]]. The name Muslimgauze is a play on the word ''[[muslin]]'' (a type of gauze) combined with ''Muslim'', referring to Jones' preoccupation with conflicts throughout the Muslim world.",
