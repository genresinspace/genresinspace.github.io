The project was founded in 1996 and ended in 2003, with a short reunion following in 2007 and revivals in 2019 and 2020-22.

Elverum is the principal songwriter and producer behind the band's albums, but a rotating cast of several other musicians feature on his recordings and tours. Many of Elverum's recordings from the project's initial period were released by the label [[K Records]].\n\nSince 2003, Elverum has recorded and performed primarily under the name [[Mount Eerie]]. He played a one-off concert in Anacortes, WA under the name the Microphones in June 2019 and announced the release of the fifth and final Microphones album, ''[[Microphones in 2020]]'', in August 2020. This was followed by a limited run of tour dates in 2021 and 2022 to play the album live before disbanding again.",
