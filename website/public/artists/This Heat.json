  "description": "'''This Heat''' were an English [[experimental rock]] band, formed in early 1976 in [[Camberwell]], London by multi-instrumentalists Charles Bullen (guitar, clarinet, viola, vocals, tapes), [[Charles Hayward (musician)|Charles Hayward]] (drums, keyboards, vocals, tapes) and [[Gareth Williams (English musician)|Gareth Williams]] (keyboard, guitar, bass, vocals, tapes).\n\nThis Heat were active during the ascendancy of British [[punk rock|punk]], but stood apart from that scene due to an experimental and confrontational approach. This Heat's commercial success was limited and, during the groupâ€™s existence, their discography consisted of only two albums and an EP. The band would influence genres such as [[post-punk]], [[industrial music]], and [[post-rock]].\n\nWilliams died of cancer in 2001. From 2016 until 2019, Bullen and Hayward reunited, playing under the name '''This Is Not This Heat'''.",
