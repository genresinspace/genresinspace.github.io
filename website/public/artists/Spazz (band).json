  "description": "'''Spazz''' was an American [[powerviolence]] band active between 1992 and 2000. The trio released numerous records within this time, many of which are now highly collectible due to their relative rarity. The band's releases often showcased their unusual sense of humour: absurdly long and nonsensical song titles, audio samples from [[B movie]]s and [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] films between songs and the occasional use of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] beats as well as saxophones, banjos and other instruments rarely associated with [[hardcore punk]]. All three of the members shared vocal duties, usually changing in sequence from line to line. The group would typically play at all ages venues. 2015 saw the release of a tribute LP to Spazz by Scottish record label Mind Ripper Collective titled \"Spazzin' To The Oldies - A Tribute To Spazz\". In 2016, it was announced that [[Tankcrimes]] will reissue the out-of-print Spazz albums ''Sweatin' To The Oldies'' and ''Sweatin' 3: Skatin', Satan & Katon''.",
