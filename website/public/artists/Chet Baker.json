  "description": "'''Chesney Henry''' \"'''Chet'''\" '''Baker Jr.''' (December 23, 1929 â€“ May 13, 1988) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter and vocalist. He is known for major innovations in [[cool jazz]] that led him to be nicknamed the \"Prince of Cool\".\n\nBaker earned much attention and critical praise through the 1950s, particularly for albums featuring his vocals: ''[[Chet Baker Sings]]'' (1954) and ''[[(Chet Baker Sings) It Could Happen to You|It Could Happen to You]]'' (1958). Jazz historian [[Dave Gelly]] described the promise of Baker's early career as \"[[James Dean]], [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]], and [[Bix Beiderbecke|Bix]], rolled into one\". His well-publicized [[Substance dependence|drug habit]] also drove his notoriety and fame. Baker was in and out of jail frequently before enjoying a career resurgence in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
