  "description": "'''Wilson, Keppel and Betty''' formed a popular British [[music hall]] and [[vaudeville]] act in the middle decades of the 20th century. They capitalised on the fashion for [[Ancient Egypt]]ian imagery following the discovery of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]]. The \"[[Sanding (dance)|sand dance]]\" that formed the highlight of their act was a parody of postures from Egyptian tomb paintings, combined with references to [[Arabs|Arabic]] costume. The lithe and extremely lanky Wilson and Keppel, who wore long moustaches and make-up to emphasise the sharp angularity of their features and make them appear almost identical, demonstrated their impressive suppleness in [[eccentric dance|adopting wild gestures]] and dancing in identical \"stereo\" movements, while Betty joined their antics. The act included a soft-shoe routine performed on a layer of sand spread on the stage to create a rhythmic scratching with their shuffling feet and was usually performed to the familiar ''[[Ballet Ã©gyptien|Egyptian Ballet]]'' (1875), by [[Alexandre Luigini]].",
