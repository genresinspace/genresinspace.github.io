  "name": "Public Image Ltd",
  "description": "'''Public Image Ltd''' (abbreviated and stylised as '''PiL''') are an English [[post-punk]] band formed by lead vocalist [[John Lydon]] (previously, as Johnny Rotten, lead vocalist of the [[Sex Pistols]]), guitarist [[Keith Levene]] (a founding member of [[the Clash]]), bassist [[Jah Wobble]], and drummer [[Jim Walker (drummer)|Jim Walker]] in May 1978. The group's line-up has changed frequently over the years; Lydon has been the sole constant member.\n\nFollowing Lydon's departure from the [[Sex Pistols]] in January 1978, he sought a more experimental \"anti-[[rock music|rock]]\" project and formed PiL in June of that year. PiL released their debut studio album ''[[Public Image: First Issue|First Issue]]'' (1978), creating an abrasive, bass-heavy sound that drew on [[dub reggae|dub]], [[noise music|noise]], [[progressive rock]] and [[disco]]. PiL's second studio album ''[[Metal Box]]'' (1979) pushed their sound further into the [[avant-garde]], and is often regarded as one of the most important albums of the post-punk era.\n\nBy 1984, Levene, Wobble and Walker had departed and the group was effectively a solo vehicle for Lydon, who moved toward a more accessible sound with the commercially successful studio albums ''[[This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get]]'' (1984) and ''[[Album (Public Image Ltd album)|Album]]'' (1986). After a late 1990s hiatus, Lydon reformed the group in 2009 and has released several further albums, including ''[[What the World Needs Now...]]'' (2015).",
