Growing up he would listen to [[techno]] and [[House music|house]] stations on the radio, such as [[the Electrifying Mojo]] on [[WMXD]], which would highly influence his sound. He started DJing at age 12 at local high school parties. He later moved for college to [[Atlanta]], he was a member of rap duo Assault-n-Battery that pulled from Atlanta's bass scene. His love for hip hop and songwriting would be incorporated into his later electronic work.\n\nUpon returning to Detroit in the '90s, Adams released a series of singles under the name DJ Assault with producer Mr. De' on Electrofunk Records and Assault Rifle Records. The success of the tracks \"Sex on the Beach\" and \"Ass and Titties\" in the mid-'90s lifted him to fame. In the mid-2000s, he founded the label Jefferson Ave.\n\nIn 2023, Berlin club {{Interlanguage link|Kater Blau|de|Kater Blau}} and radio station HÖR Berlin cancelled DJ Assault performances due to unspecified social media posts of the artist. This was met with push back from some music goers.\n\nAdams is known for his comedic and explicit lyrics. He has rejected the categorization of his music as \"ghettotech.\" Adams has cited [[Jeff Mills|the Wizard]], [[Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk|Farley Jackmaster Funk]], [[Bad Boy Bill]], [[Mike \"Hitman\" Wilson|Mike Hitman Wilson]], and Julian “Jumpin” Perez as influences.",
