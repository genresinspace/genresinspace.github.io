  "description": "'''The Specials''', also known as '''the Special AKA''', were an English [[Two-tone (music genre)|2 tone]] and [[ska]] revival band formed in 1977 in [[Coventry]]. After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]] and [[Neville Staple]] on vocals, [[Jerry Dammers]] on keyboards, [[Lynval Golding]] and [[Roddy Radiation]] on guitars, [[Horace Panter]] on bass, [[John Bradbury (drummer)|John Bradbury]] on drums, and [[Dick Cuthell]] and [[Rico Rodriguez (musician)|Rico Rodriguez]] on horns. The band wore [[mod (subculture)|mod]]-style \"1960s period [[rude boy]] outfits ([[pork pie hat]]s, tonic and [[mohair]] suits and loafers)\". Their music combines the danceable rhythms of ska and [[rocksteady]] with the energy and attitude of [[punk rock|punk]]. Lyrically, their work (often written by primary songwriter Dammers) presented overt political and social commentary.\n\nIn 1980, their ''[[The Special AKA Live!]]'' EP, featuring lead track \"Too Much Too Young\", reached No. 1 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 1981, the recession-themed single \"[[Ghost Town (The Specials song)|Ghost Town]]\" also hit No. 1 in the UK.\n\nAfter seven consecutive UK [[Top 40|top 10]] singles between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form [[Fun Boy Three]]. Continuing as \"the Special AKA\" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material until 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single \"[[Free Nelson Mandela]]\". After this, founder Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism.\n\nThe group re-formed in 1993, and continued to perform and record with varying line-ups – none of them involving Dammers – until the  death of Terry Hall in December 2022.",
