  "description": "'''Stereolab''' are an [[English people|Anglo]]-French [[avant-pop]] band formed in London in 1990. Led by the songwriting team of [[Tim Gane]] and [[Lætitia Sadier]], the group's sound incorporates repetitive [[motorik]] beats with the use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French, drawing influences from [[krautrock]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], 1960s [[Yé-yé|French pop]] and [[Brazilian music]]. Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the [[Surrealist]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist]] art movements.\n\nStereolab were formed by Gane (guitar and keyboards) and Sadier (vocals, keyboards and guitar) after the break-up of [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]]. The two were romantically involved for fourteen years and are the group's only consistent members. Other longtime members included 1992 addition [[Mary Hansen]] (backing vocals, keyboards and guitar), who died in 2002, and 1993 addition Andy Ramsay (drums). [[The High Llamas]]' leader [[Sean O'Hagan]] (guitar and keyboards) was a member from 1993 to 1994 and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances.\n\nThroughout their career, Stereolab have achieved moderate commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with [[Elektra Records]], and their self-owned label [[Duophonic Records|Duophonic]] signed a distribution deal with [[Too Pure]] and later [[Warp Records]]. After a ten-year hiatus, the band reunited for live performances in 2019, with a brand new studio album, ''[[Instant Holograms on Metal Film]]'', released in 2025.",
