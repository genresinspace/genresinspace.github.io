  "description": "'''Máxima Alerta''' is a [[Cuban-American]] fusion music band known for its merging of Cuban [[reggaeton]], or [[Cubaton]], with traditional [[Cuban music]] and other Latin musical genres.\n\nThe band, founded in 1999 by Ray Machado in [[Santa Clara, Cuba]], is credited, along with the band [[Cubanito 20.02]], for popularizing Cubaton. Stylistically, it is known for its incorporating [[son Cubano]], [[Conga (music)|conga]], [[cumbia]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[merengue music|merengue]], and [[Cuban rumba]], as well as styles and forms such as [[rap]] and [[ballads]]. After the band was banned from performing in Cuba, Machado emigrated to [[Hudson County, New Jersey]] in the [[United States]], where it resumed performing in 2011, playing in local venues such as the [[Park Performing Arts Center]] and [[Maxwell's|Maxwell]]'s, and at New York City locations such as [[The Bitter End]].",
