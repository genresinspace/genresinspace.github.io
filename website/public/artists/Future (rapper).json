  "description": "'''Nayvadius DeMun Cash''' ([[Birth name|né]] '''Wilburn'''; born November 20, 1983), known professionally as '''Future''', is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer. Known for his [[mumble rap|mumble]]-styled vocals and prolific output, Future is credited with having pioneered the use of [[Auto-Tune]]d melodies in [[hip-hop]] and [[trap music]]. Due to the sustained popularity of this musical style, he is commonly regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], Future signed a recording contract with [[Rocko (rapper)|Rocko]]'s [[A1 Recordings]] in 2011, which entered a joint venture with [[Epic Records]] shortly after. His first two studio albums, ''[[Pluto (Future album)|Pluto]]'' (2012) and ''[[Honest (Future album)|Honest]]'' (2014), were both met with critical and commercial success, spawning the [[RIAA certification|platinum]]-certified singles \"[[Turn On the Lights (song)|Turn On the Lights]]\", \"[[Honest (Future song)|Honest]]\", \"[[Move That Dope]]\" (featuring [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Pusha T]]), and \"[[I Won]]\" (featuring [[Kanye West]]). His subsequent albums have each debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; his third and fourth, ''[[DS2 (album)|DS2]]'' (2015) and ''[[Evol (Future album)|Evol]]'' (2016), were supported by the singles \"[[Where Ya At]]\" (featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]) and \"[[Low Life (song)|Low Life]]\" (featuring [[the Weeknd]]), respectively. Future's [[Future (Future album)|eponymous fifth album]] and its follow-up, ''[[Hndrxx]]'' (both 2017) made him the first musical act to release two chart-topping projects on the ''Billboard'' 200 in consecutive weeks—the former spawned his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top ten single, \"[[Mask Off]].\"\n\nAfter departing A1, Future released the albums ''[[The Wizrd]]'' (2019) and ''[[High Off Life]]'' (2020)—the latter spawned the [[RIAA certification|diamond]]-certified single \"[[Life Is Good (song)|Life Is Good]]\" (featuring Drake). Future guest appeared alongside [[Young Thug]] on Drake's 2021 single \"[[Way 2 Sexy]],\" which became his first number-one song on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 after a record-breaking 125 entries. His ninth album, ''[[I Never Liked You (album)|I Never Liked You]]'' (2022) spawned the single \"[[Wait for U]]\" (featuring Drake and [[Tems]]), which became his second to peak the chart and first to do so as a lead artist. At the [[65th Annual Grammy Awards]], the song won [[Best Melodic Rap Performance]], while its parent album received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]]. His two collaborative albums with record producer [[Metro Boomin]]—''[[We Don't Trust You]]'' and ''[[We Still Don't Trust You]]'' (both 2024)—continued his string of number-one projects on the ''Billboard'' 200; the former spawned his third ''Billboard'' Hot 100-number one single, \"[[Like That (Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar song)|Like That]]\" (with Metro Boomin and [[Kendrick Lamar]]); which became his first Hot-100 leader to lead for multiple weeks. Future then released ''[[Mixtape Pluto]]'' (2024), his seventeenth mixtape which caused him to become the first hip-hop artist to have three number one albums in the same year, and in less than six months.\n\nFuture has released the [[mixtape]]s ''[[Beast Mode (Future album)|Beast Mode]]'' (with [[Zaytoven]]), ''[[56 Nights]]'' (with [[Southside (record producer)|Southside]]), and ''[[What a Time to Be Alive]]'' (with Drake) in 2015—the latter spawned the single \"[[Jumpman (song)|Jumpman]]\".
