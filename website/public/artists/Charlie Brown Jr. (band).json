  "name": "Charlie Brown Jr.",
  "description": "'''Charlie Brown Jr.''' was a Brazilian [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Santos, São Paulo]]. The group was popular with disadvantaged youth because of their relatable commentary about social issues and the frequent use of [[skate punk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] slang in their songs. The band won two [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and was one of the most-popular Brazilian bands of the late 1990s to mid-2000s.\n\nVocalist [[Chorão]]'s drug [[addiction]] and disagreements with other musicians frequently overshadowed the band. Chorão was the only founding member to remain through several lineup changes. After Chorão died of a [[cocaine]] overdose on 6 March 2013, the band disbanded.\n\nIn 2015, the streaming platform [[Deezer]] reported that Charlie Brown Jr. was the second most-listened-to Brazilian band outside Brazil. In a [[Spotify]] survey also from 2015, the band placed 31st out of the 47 most-popular bands and artists.",
