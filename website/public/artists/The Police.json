  "description": "'''The Police''' were an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1977. Within a few months of their first gig, the line-up settled as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), [[Andy Summers]] (guitar) and [[Stewart Copeland]] (drums, percussion), and this remained unchanged for the rest of the band's history. The Police became globally popular from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Emerging in the British [[New wave music|new wave]] scene, they played a style of rock influenced by [[punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], and [[jazz]].\n\nTheir 1978 debut album, ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', reached No. 6 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and contains the singles \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" and \"[[Can't Stand Losing You]]\". Their second album, ''[[Reggatta de Blanc]]'' (1979), became the first of four consecutive No. 1 studio albums in the UK and Australia; its first two singles, \"[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]\" and \"[[Walking on the Moon]]\", became their first UK number-one singles. Their next two albums, ''[[Zenyatta Mondatta]]'' (1980) and ''[[Ghost in the Machine (album)|Ghost in the Machine]]'' (1981), led to further critical and commercial success, with two songs, \"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\" and \"[[Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic]]\", becoming UK number-one singles and Top 5 hits in other countries. The former album was their breakthrough into the US, reaching number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nTheir final studio album, ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' (1983), was No. 1 in the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy and the US, selling over 8 million copies in the US. Its lead single, \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\", became their fifth UK number one, and only US number one. During this time, the band were considered one of the leaders of the [[Second British Invasion]] of the US: in 1983 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' labelled them \"the first British New Wave act to break through in America on a grand scale, and possibly the biggest band in the world\". However, at the height of their fame the Police disbanded in 1984, periodically reuniting for one-off performances before fully reuniting in early 2007 for a [[The Police Reunion Tour|world tour]] ending in August 2008. They were the world's highest-earning musicians in 2008 due to their reunion tour, which was the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours#Highest-grossing tours by year|highest-grossing tour]] of 2007.\n\nThe Police have sold over 75 million records, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling bands of all time]]. The band won a number of music awards, including six&nbsp;[[Grammy Awards]], two&nbsp;[[Brit&nbsp;Awards]] (winning [[BRIT Award for British Group|Best British Group]] once), and an [[MTV Video Music Award]]. In 2003, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Four of their five studio albums appeared on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\". The band were included among both ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s and [[VH1]]'s lists of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".",
