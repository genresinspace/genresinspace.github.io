  "description": "'''The Shadows''' (originally known as '''the Drifters''' between 1958 and 1959) were an English [[instrumental rock]] group, who dominated the British popular music charts in the pre-[[Beatles]] era from the late 1950s to the early 1960s. They served as the [[backing band]] for [[Cliff Richard]] from 1958 to 1968, and have joined him for several reunion tours.\n\nThe Shadows had 69 UK chart singles from the 1950s to the 2000s, 35 as the Shadows and 34 as '''Cliff Richard and the Shadows''', ranging from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[surf rock]] and [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]] with a [[jazz]] influence. The group, who were in the forefront of the UK [[beat-group]] boom, were the first backing band to emerge as stars.\n\nAs pioneers of the four-member instrumental format, the band consisted of lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums. The Shadows built their signature sound on [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] guitars and [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] amplifiers, but around 1964, they replaced their Fenders with [[Burns London|Burns]] guitars, with Bruce Welch citing tuning issues as the main reason.\n\nThe core members from 1958 to the present are guitarists [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]] and drummer [[Brian Bennett]] (who has been with the group since 1961) with various bassists and occasionally keyboardists through the years.",
