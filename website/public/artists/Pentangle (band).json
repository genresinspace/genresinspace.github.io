  "name": "Pentangle",
  "description": "'''Pentangle''' are a British [[folk rock]] band, formed in London in 1967. The original band was active in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and a later version has been active since the early 1980s. The original line-up, which was unchanged throughout the band's first incarnation (1967â€“1973), was [[Jacqui McShee]] (vocals); [[John Renbourn]] (vocals and guitar); [[Bert Jansch]] (vocals and guitar); [[Danny Thompson]] ([[double bass]]); and [[Terry Cox]] (drums).\n\nThe name ''Pentangle'' was chosen to represent the five members of the band. It was also the device on {{nowrap|Sir Gawain's}} shield in the [[Middle English]] poem ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', which held a fascination for Renbourn.\n\nIn 2007, the original members of the band were reunited to receive a Lifetime Achievement award at the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] and to record a short concert that was broadcast on [[BBC]] radio. The following June, all five original members began a twelve-date UK tour.",
