They began their careers by producing [[trance music]], before venturing into [[big room house]] and other forms of [[Electronic dance music|EDM]].\n\nAfter producing trance for five years, W&W founded their own record label called [[Mainstage Music]], and became active in the [[big room house]] scene. This was followed by the release of their commercial breakthrough \"Bigfoot\" in 2014. In 2017, they returned to their original trance style with the '''NWYR''' (pronounced \"new year\") project. Their record label Mainstage changed its name to Rave Culture at the end of 2018, focusing on a wider variety of genres.",
