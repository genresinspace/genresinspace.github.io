  "description": "'''The Postal Service''' was an American [[indie pop]] group from [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], consisting of singer [[Ben Gibbard]], producer [[Dntel|Jimmy Tamborello]] (also known by his stage name, Dntel), and [[Jenny Lewis]] on background vocals.\n\nThe band released their sole studio album, ''[[Give Up]]'', in 2003 on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]], to mostly positive reviews. The album reached number 45 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and received platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The group decided to disband two years later, viewing attempts at a follow-up as unnecessary.\n\nThe band has regrouped twice for the anniversaries of ''Give Up'', in both 2013 and 2023; each time they were accompanied by a rotating cast of support musicians, including Laura Burhenn, [[Jen Wood]], [[Dave Depper]] and [[Jason McGerr]].\n\nThe band announced that their last performance would be on September 21, 2024 at [[HFStival]] in Washington D.C.",
