  "name": "Fear Factory",
  "description": "'''Fear Factory''' is an American [[industrial<!-- encompasses their whole discography; don't change to heavy metal --> metal]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1989. It has released ten full-length albums and evolved through a succession of sounds, all in its main style of industrial metal. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen frequent changes in its lineup, with lead vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] the only consistent member for 31 years until his departure in 2020. Guitarist [[Dino Cazares]] is the only original member still in the band. \n\nThe band went on hiatus in March 2002 after internal disputes, but resumed activity a year later without Cazares. Former bassist [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] replaced him on guitar, while [[Byron Stroud]] handled bass duties. After a second hiatus in 2006, Fear Factory reunited in 2009 with a new lineup that featured Cazares, [[Gene Hoglan]] as the replacement of original drummer [[Raymond Herrera]], and Bell and Stroud reprising their respective roles; this lineup recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Mechanize]]'' (2010). Wolbers and Herrera—together comprising 50% of the band's legal ownership—disputed the reunited band's legitimacy, and a legal battle began. Despite this, Fear Factory has since released ''[[The Industrialist]]'' (2012), ''[[Genexus (album)|Genexus]]'' (2015), and ''[[Aggression Continuum]]'' (2021).\n\nFear Factory has performed at [[Ozzfest]] four times and the inaugural [[Gigantour]]. Its singles have charted on the US [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] Top 40 and albums on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40, 100, and 200. It has sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.",
