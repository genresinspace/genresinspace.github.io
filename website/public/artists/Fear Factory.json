  "description": "'''Fear Factory''' is an American [[industrial<!-- encompasses their whole discography; don't change to heavy metal --> metal]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1989. Throughout the band's career, they have released ten full-length albums and have evolved through a succession of sounds, all in their main style of industrial metal. Over the years, Fear Factory has seen frequent changes in its lineup, with lead vocalist [[Burton C. Bell]] being the only consistent member for 31 years until his departure in 2020. Guitarist [[Dino Cazares]] is the only original member still in the band. \n\nThe band went on hiatus in March 2002 following some internal disputes, but resumed activity a year later without founding member Cazares. Previous bassist [[Christian Olde Wolbers]] replaced him on guitar, while [[Byron Stroud]] handled bass duties. After a second hiatus in 2006, Fear Factory reunited in April 2009 with a new lineup that featured a returning Cazares, [[Gene Hoglan]] as the replacement of original drummer [[Raymond Herrera]], and Bell and Stroud reprising their respective roles; this lineup recorded the band's seventh studio album titled ''[[Mechanize]]'' (2010). Wolbers and Herrera — together comprising 50% of the band's legal ownership — disputed the legitimacy of the reunited band, and a legal battle from both parties had begun. Despite this, Fear Factory has since released three more albums: ''[[The Industrialist]]'' (2012), ''[[Genexus (album)|Genexus]]'' (2015) and ''[[Aggression Continuum]]'' (2021).\n\nThe band has performed at [[Ozzfest]] four times and the inaugural [[Gigantour]]. Their singles have charted on the US Mainstream Rock Top 40 and albums on the Billboard Top 40, 100, and 200, and they have sold more than a million albums in the U.S. alone.",
