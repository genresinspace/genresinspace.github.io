  "name": "Nadja",
  "description": "'''Nadja''' is a Canadian duo of [[Aidan Baker]] (guitars, vocals, piano, woodwinds, drums) and Leah Buckareff (bass, vocals). Nadja began in 2003 as a solo project for Baker to explore the heavier and noisier side of his [[experimental music|experimental]] [[ambient music]] performed mainly on the [[electric guitar]]. In 2005 Buckareff joined in order to make the project more than just a studio endeavour and to allow Nadja to perform live.\n\nThe band's name comes from Aidan's name spelled backwards in order to match the concept of a musical style different from his own work. The J replacing the I is, according to Aidan, a reference to the Nadja character from [[André Breton]]'s [[Nadja (novel)|book of the same name]] and [[Elina Löwensohn]]'s character from the [[Nadja (film)|1994 vampire movie]]. The duo are a married couple and are based in [[Berlin]].",
