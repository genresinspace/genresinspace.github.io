  "description": "'''Judas Priest''' are an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1969. They have sold over 50 million albums and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Judas Priest have also been referred to as one of the pioneers of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) movement, and are cited as a formative influence on various metal subgenres, including [[speed metal]], [[thrash metal]], and [[power metal]], as well as the [[hard rock]]/[[glam metal]] scene of the 1980s. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with poor record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when their sixth studio album ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' brought them notable mainstream attention.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the core of bassist [[Ian Hill]], lead singer [[Rob Halford]] and guitarists [[Glenn Tipton]] and [[K. K. Downing]] saw a revolving cast of drummers (with [[Les Binks]] being the only one who played on more than one album), before [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]] joined them for ten years from 1979 to 1989. Since Holland's departure, [[Scott Travis]] has been the band's drummer. Halford left Judas Priest in 1992, and after a four-year hiatus, they regrouped in 1996 with [[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]] (formerly of [[Winter's Bane]]) replacing him. After two albums with Owens, Halford returned to the band in 2003. Downing left Judas Priest in 2011, replaced by [[Richie Faulkner]]. The current line-up consists of Hill, Tipton, Travis, Halford and Faulkner; although Tipton remains as an official member of the band, he has limited his touring activities since 2018 due to [[Parkinson's disease]], with [[Andy Sneap]] filling in for him. Hill and Tipton are the only two members of the band to appear on every album.\n\nHalford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing was widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. ''[[The Guardian]]'' referred to ''British Steel'' as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid-1990s, the band have once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the [[VH1 Rock Honors]] in 2006, receiving a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series. In 2022, the band were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] via the Award for Musical Excellence.",
