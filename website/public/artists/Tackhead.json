  "description": "'''Tackhead''' (styled '''TACK>>HEAD''', sometimes known as '''Fats Comet''') is an [[industrial hip-hop]] group that was most active during the 1980s and early 1990s, and briefly reformed in 2004 for a tour. Their music occupies the territory where [[funk music|funk]], [[dub music|dub]], [[industrial music]] and [[electronica]] intersect. The core members were [[Doug Wimbish]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]), [[Keith LeBlanc]] ([[percussion instrument|percussion]]) and [[Skip McDonald]] ([[guitar]]) and [[Record producer|producer]] (sometimes credited as \"mixologist\") [[Adrian Sherwood]]. Despite being short-lived as a band proper, the legacy and output of these groups of musicians has been prodigious.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}",
