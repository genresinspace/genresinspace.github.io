  "description": "'''David Ryan Adams''' (born November 5, 1974) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter. He has released 30 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].\n\nIn 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Universal Music Group Nashville#Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\n\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[Ménière's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music. However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift]]'s album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]].
