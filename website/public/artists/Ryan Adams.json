The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[Rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his [[Universal Music Group Nashville#Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] label. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\n\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|the Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[Ménière's disease]], Adams disbanded the Cardinals and took a break from music.

Adams released his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift]]'s album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums.
