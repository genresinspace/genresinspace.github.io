  "description": "'''In Flames''' is a Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Gothenburg]], formed in 1990. They are considered one of the pioneering acts of the [[Gothenburg scene|Gothenburg metal scene]], which also includes bands such as [[At the Gates]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]]. Their lineup has changed several times, with vocalist [[Anders Fridén]] and lead guitarist [[Björn Gelotte]] being the only consistent members since 1995. Since the departure of Strömblad in 2010, no original members remain with the band. The band has sold over two million records worldwide.\n\nDuring the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many [[session musician]]s. By the release of ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]'' (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to [[alternative metal]]. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.\n\nSince the band's inception, In Flames have released fourteen [[studio album]]s, three [[Extended play|EPs]], and two live DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album ''[[Foregone]]'' in 2023. In Flames has been nominated for ten Swedish [[Grammis Awards]] winning seven of them; including “Hard Rock/Metal Album of the Year” category in 2005 for ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'', 2007 for ''[[Come Clarity]]'', 2009 for ''[[A Sense of Purpose]]'', and most recently in 2024 for ''Foregone''.",
