  "name": "In Flames",
  "description": "'''In Flames''' is a Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, formed by guitarist [[Jesper Strömblad]] in [[Gothenburg]] in 1990 out of the [[Swedish death metal|Swedish death metal scene]]. Their lineup has changed several times, with vocalist [[Anders Fridén]] and lead guitarist [[Björn Gelotte]] being the only consistent members since 1995. Since the departure of Strömblad in 2010, no original members remain with the band. In Flames helped pioneer [[melodic death metal]] along with fellow Swedish bands [[At the Gates]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]]. The band has sold over two million records worldwide.\n\nDuring the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many [[session musician]]s. By the release of ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]'' (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'' (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to [[alternative metal]]. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.\n\nSince the band's inception, In Flames have released fourteen [[studio album]]s, three [[Extended play|EPs]], and two live DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album ''[[Foregone]]'' in 2023. In Flames has been nominated for ten Swedish [[Grammis Awards]] winning seven of them; including “Hard Rock/Metal Album of the Year” category in 2005 for ''[[Soundtrack to Your Escape]]'', 2007 for ''[[Come Clarity]]'', 2009 for ''[[A Sense of Purpose]]'', and most recently in 2024 for Foregone.",
