  "description": "'''Best Fwends''' are a [[musical group]] from [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. All but unknown in the United States, the duo have attracted much more notice in [[Europe]], having been featured in a [[Bacardi]] commercial in the [[United Kingdom]] and performing at [[Iceland Airwaves]] in [[Reykjavík]] and [[Øyafestivalen]] in [[Norway]]. The song featured in the Bacardi ad is \"Bedroom Music\" and was the first song the group ever recorded. They have also been featured at [[SXSW]]. They have released one full-length album and two EPs on [[Moshi Moshi Records]].\n\nWhen performing live, they use only their voices and an [[iPod]]. Difficult to categorize, their music is often compared to early [[Beastie Boys]], and has been called [[punk rock|punk]]. The band, however, claim to not be talented enough to have a \"sound.\" They are reported to use [[FL Studio]] in studio.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nRecently, they recorded musical scores for several cartoons produced by [[Frederator Studios]], including [[Bravest Warriors]], [[SuperF*ckers]] and [[Our New Electrical Morals]].",
