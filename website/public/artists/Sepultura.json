They were a major force in the [[groove metal]], [[thrash metal]], and [[death metal]] genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and their style has changed over the years, with the band merging its sound with influences and textures of [[alternative metal]], [[world music]], [[nu metal]], [[progressive rock]], [[hardcore punk]], and [[industrial metal]]. Sepultura is also considered part of the second wave of thrash metal acts from the late 1980s to early-to-mid-1990s.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/thrash-metal-book-due-in-september/|title='Thrash Metal' Book Due In September|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 24, 2007|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/07/16/thrash-flashback-kreators-pleasure-to-kill|title=Thrash Flashback: Kreator's 'Pleasure To Kill'|website=Geeksofdoom.com|date=July 16, 2012|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/120418-overkill-ironbound-2496162729.html|title=Overkill: Ironbound|website=Popmatters.com|date=February 11, 2010 |access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockencadena.home.blog/2019/06/05/programa-no8|title=Programa Nº8 – Rock en Cadena|website=Rockencadena.home.blog|date=June 5, 2019 |access-date=September 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/30-essential-thrash-metal-bands-that-arent-the-big-four|title=30 Essential thrash metal bands that aren't the big four|work=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|loudersound.com]]|access-date=October 22, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/flotsam_and_jetsam_writing_new_album.html|title=Flotsam and Jetsam Writing New Album|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|access-date=June 23, 2022|date=June 23, 2022}}</ref>}}\n\nSepultura has released fifteen studio albums to date. The band released its debut album ''[[Morbid Visions]]'' in 1986, followed a year later by their second album ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]''; the latter caught the attention of several record labels, including [[Roadrunner Records]], with whom Sepultura signed in 1988. Their third album, and Roadrunner debut, ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'' (1989) garnered the band its first breakthrough outside of Brazil. The next three albums – ''[[Arise (Sepultura album)|Arise]]'' (1991), ''[[Chaos A.D.]]'' (1993) and ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'' (1996) – cemented Sepultura's reputation as one of the most successful heavy metal bands of the 1990s. The band has sold over three million units in the United States and almost 20 million worldwide, gaining multiple [[Music recording certification|gold and platinum]] records around the globe, including in countries as diverse as France, Australia, Indonesia, the United States, Cyprus, and their native Brazil.\n\nSepultura has undergone several membership changes throughout its {{Age|1984|1|1}}-year career, with Max and Igor Cavalera departing in 1997 and 2006, respectively. Their \"classic\" lineup, which lasted for nearly a decade, consisted of Max, Igor, bassist [[Paulo Jr.]] and guitarist [[Andreas Kisser]]. Since Igor's departure in 2006, there have been no original members left in the band.
