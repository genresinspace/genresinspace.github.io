  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''The Gerogerigegege'''|ザ・ゲロゲリゲゲゲ}} ({{IPA|ja|za ɡeɾo ɡeɾi ɡeɡeɡe}}) (derived from Japanese terms for [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]] and [[onomatopoeia]] for an expression of [[disgust]]) is a Japanese [[experimental music]] project, founded in 1985 by {{Nihongo|Juntaro Yamanouchi|山ノ内純太郎|Yamanouchi Juntarō}}. \n\nThough they are often categorized with [[Japanoise|Japanese harsh noise]] acts such as [[Merzbow]] and [[Masonna]], The Gerogerigegege has also released albums of more straightforward [[punk rock]] (''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male''), [[noise music|noise]] (''45 RPM Performance''), and [[ambient music]] (''None Friendly'', ''Endless Humiliation'' and ''>(decrescendo)''), in addition to several [[Extended play|seven inch records]] mixing these styles with found recordings. The group is known for their 1990 album ''Tokyo Anal Dynamite'', a 75-track [[Album#Live|live album]] drawing from [[noisecore]], [[noise music|noise]] and [[hardcore punk]].\n\nDespite limited coverage during their initial run, due in part to the material's extreme sound and vulgar subject matter, their music has since garnered a [[cult following]]. Juntaro Yamanouchi also ran the Vis a Vis [[record label]].",
