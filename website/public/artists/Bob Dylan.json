Dylan added increasingly sophisticated lyrical techniques to the [[folk music]] of the early 1960s, infusing it \"with the intellectualism of classic literature and poetry\".

He moved to New York City in 1961 to pursue a career in music. Following his 1962 debut album, ''[[Bob Dylan (album)|Bob Dylan]]'', featuring traditional folk and blues material, he released his breakthrough album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963), which included \"[[Girl from the North Country]]\" and \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\", adapting older folk songs. His songs \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" (1963) and \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]{{-\"}} (1964) became anthems for the [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|antiwar]] movements.
