  "description": "'''The Budos Band''' is an North American instrumental band from [[Staten Island|Staten Island, New York]], formed in 2005. [[AllMusic]] describes the group as a \"doom rock [[Afro-soul]] big band with a '70s touch\" that joins \"musical universes from trippy [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and Afro-funk to '70s [[hard rock]] and late-'60s soul.\" They have described themselves as \"70's Psychedelic Instrumental Music,\" and \"Afro-soul inspired by [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian music]] with a soul undercurrent\" and \"sprinkled a little bit of sweet 60's stuff on top.\" One press release described the band as “sounding as if Quentin Tarantino was the music supervisor for a Bond film\". Their more recent albums have incorporated sounds from 1970s [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[Afrobeat|Afro-Beat]], underground rock, and [[Heavy metal music|proto-metal]]. They have been signed to [[Daptone Records]] throughout their career.",
