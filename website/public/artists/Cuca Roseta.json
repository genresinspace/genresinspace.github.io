  "description": "'''Maria Isabel Rebelo Couto da Cruz Roseta''' (born 2 December 1981), known professionally as '''Cuca Roseta''', is a Portuguese [[fado]] singer, composer, and model. Roseta is considered one of the most important fado representatives of her generation, appearing early in her career in the movie ''[[Fados (film)|Fados]]'' by Spanish director Carlos Saura. Fado, a musical genre that originated in [[Lisbon]] in the early 19th century, is traditionally characterized by feelings of resignation and melancholia, but Roseta's style also incorporates more upbeat influences from [[world music]]. She has released seven studio albums with producers including [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] and [[Nelson Motta]], has toured extensively, and collaborated with different artists including David Bisbal, Karl Jenkins, and Stewart Sukuma. Roseta has appeared on the television shows ''[[Got Talent Portugal]]'', ''Rising Star'', and ''[[The Voice Kids (Portuguese TV series)|The Voice Kids Portugal]]'' as a judge, and as a competitor in ''Dancing with the Stars''. She has worked toward causes such as road safety and environmental sustainability, and in 2021 gave a series of hospital concerts to the health professionals fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic.",
