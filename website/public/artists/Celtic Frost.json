  "description": "'''Celtic Frost''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k|_|f|r|ɒ|s|t}}) was a Swiss [[extreme metal]] band from [[Zürich]]. They are remembered for their strong influence on the development of extreme styles such as [[Death metal|death]], [[Black metal|black]] and [[doom metal]], and for their [[avant-garde metal|avant-garde]] approach to music in general.\n\nGuitarist and vocalist [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] and bassist [[Martin Eric Ain]] formed Celtic Frost in June 1984 after disbanding their previous band, [[Hellhammer]]. Celtic Frost's debut record, ''[[Morbid Tales]]'', was released later that year. It was followed by the albums ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'' (1985) and ''[[Into the Pandemonium]]'' (1987). All three records were highly influential. While each contains elements of avant-garde composition, ''Into the Pandemonium'' was particularly noted for its unique style and experimentation with musical boundaries beyond the heavy metal genre.\n\nCeltic Frost's next album, ''[[Cold Lake (album)|Cold Lake]]'' (1988), featured a new lineup and a dramatic change of style, which was widely criticized for its commercial and flamboyant tone. After releasing ''[[Vanity/Nemesis]]'' (1990), the group temporarily disbanded. Celtic Frost re-formed in 2001 and released the critically acclaimed ''[[Monotheist (album)|Monotheist]]'' (2006). They disbanded permanently in 2008, when Fischer left to form [[Triptykon]].\n\nThe band's music included elements of various extreme metal styles. Their early work is often classified as [[thrash metal|thrash]], black or death metal with experimental tendencies, while their last album is described as doom metal. Celtic Frost drew inspiration from early heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], and [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[gothic rock]] acts like [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Christian Death]], and [[Joy Division]], as well as [[hardcore punk]] groups like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[GBH (band)|GBH]].",
