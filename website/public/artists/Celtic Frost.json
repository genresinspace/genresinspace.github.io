  "description": "'''Celtic Frost''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|t|ɪ|k|_|f|r|ɒ|s|t}}) was a Swiss [[metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Zürich]]. They are remembered for their strong influence on the development of [[extreme metal]] and [[avant-garde metal]].\n\nGuitarist and vocalist [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] and bassist [[Martin Eric Ain]] formed Celtic Frost in June 1984 after disbanding their previous band, [[Hellhammer]]. Celtic Frost's debut record, ''[[Morbid Tales]]'', was released that year. It was followed by ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'' (1985) and the more experimental ''[[Into the Pandemonium]]'' (1987). All three records were influential.\n\nCeltic Frost's next album, ''[[Cold Lake (album)|Cold Lake]]'' (1988), featured a new lineup and a dramatic change of style, which was widely criticized for its commercial and flamboyant tone. After releasing ''[[Vanity/Nemesis]]'' (1990), the group disbanded. Celtic Frost re-formed in 2001 and released the critically acclaimed ''[[Monotheist (album)|Monotheist]]'' (2006). They disbanded permanently in 2008, when Fischer left to form [[Triptykon]]\n\nTheir music included elements of various extreme metal styles. Their early work is often classified as [[thrash metal]] or [[black metal]] with experimental tendencies, while their last album is described as [[doom metal]]. Celtic Frost drew inspiration from early heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], and [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[gothic rock]] acts like [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Christian Death]], and [[Joy Division]], as well as [[hardcore punk]] groups like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[GBH (band)|GBH]].",
