  "description": "'''Helloween''' is a German [[power metal]] band founded in 1984 in [[Hamburg]] by members of bands Iron Fist, Gentry, Second Hell and Powerfool. The band has at times been called one of the most influential European heavy metal bands of the 1980s. Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]] and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. By the time Hansen left Helloween in 1989 to form [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], the band had evolved into a five-piece, with [[Michael Kiske]] taking over as lead vocalist. Schwichtenberg and Kiske both parted ways with Helloween in 1993; Schwichtenberg died two years later as the result of suicide.

As a septet, their current lineup features all of the surviving members of the ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys]]'' lineup (Hansen, Weikath, Kiske, Grosskopf), in addition to the remaining members from the ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]''-era (singer [[Andi Deris]], guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] and drummer [[Daniel Loble]]).\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released 16 studio albums, five live albums, three EPs and 31 singles, was honored with 14 gold and six platinum awards and has sold more than 10 million records worldwide.
