  "description": "'''Pearl Jam''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]], Washington, in 1990. One of the key bands in the [[grunge|grunge movement]] of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam has outsold and outlasted many of its contemporaries from the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands from that decade, dubbed \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\". Since 1998, the band's lineup has comprised bassist [[Jeff Ament]], guitarists [[Stone Gossard]] and [[Mike McCready]], vocalist/guitarist [[Eddie Vedder]] and drummer [[Matt Cameron]]; keyboardist [[Boom Gaspar]] has also been a session and touring member with the band since 2002. Drummers [[Dave Krusen]], [[Matt Chamberlain]], [[Dave Abbruzzese]], and [[Jack Irons]] are former members of the band.\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous bands, [[Green River (band)|Green River]] and [[Mother Love Bone]], Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album - ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'' - in 1991. ''Ten'' stayed on the US ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock albums ever, being certified [[RIAA certification|13Ã— platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'', sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'' (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n \nPearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band sued [[Ticketmaster]] in 1994, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, ''Rolling Stone'' described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame\".\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 100{{nbsp}}million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32{{nbsp}}million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling bands of all time]]. Pearl Jam was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has promoted wider social and political issues, such as [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] sentiments and opposition to [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush's presidency]], with Vedder acting as its spokesman on these issues.",
