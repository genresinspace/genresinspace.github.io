  "description": "The '''Misfits''' are an American [[punk rock]] band, often recognized as pioneers of the [[horror punk]] subgenre, blending punk and other musical influences with [[horror film]] themes and imagery. The group was formed in 1977 in [[Lodi, New Jersey]], by vocalist, songwriter, and keyboardist [[Glenn Danzig]]. Shortly after, bassist [[Jerry Only]] joined, and the pair remained the core members through numerous personnel changes over the next six years. During this period, they released several [[extended play|EPs]] and [[single (music)|singles]], and with Only's brother [[Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein|Doyle]] on guitar, the albums ''[[Walk Among Us]]'' (1982) and ''[[Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood]]'' (1983) were released—both considered touchstones of the early-1980s [[hardcore punk]] movement. Over the years, the band has undergone many lineup changes, with [[Jerry Only]] serving as the group’s only constant member.\n\nThe Misfits disbanded in 1983, and Glenn Danzig went on to form [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] and then [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]]. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music later became influential to punk rock, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], and [[alternative rock]], including high-profile acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[NOFX]], [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Cradle of Filth]]. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer [[Michale Graves]] and drummer [[Dr. Chud]]. This incarnation of Misfits had more of a heavy metal sound, and released the albums ''[[American Psycho (album)|American Psycho]]'' (1997) and ''[[Famous Monsters]]'' (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] guitarist [[Dez Cadena]] and former [[Ramones]] drummer [[Marky Ramone]] for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour.\n\nThis lineup released an album of [[cover version|cover songs]] in 2003, titled ''[[Project 1950]]'', and toured for several years. In 2005, Marky was replaced by [[Robo (musician)|Robo]], who had previously drummed for the Misfits (1982–1983) and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. This lineup released a single titled \"[[Land of the Dead (Misfits song)|Land of the Dead]]\" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce released a new album, ''[[The Devil's Rain (album)|The Devil's Rain]]'', in October 2011. In 2015, Cadena announced he would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis and was replaced by Only's son, Jerry Caiafa III (stage name Jerry Other). That same year, [[Soulfly]]'s [[Marc Rizzo]] joined the band on guitar, temporarily filling in for Cadena before Caiafa became the sole guitarist.\n\nIn September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only, and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows as the Original Misfits at that year's edition of [[Riot Fest]], along with drummer [[Dave Lombardo]] and second guitarist [[Acey Slade]]. The Original Misfits lineup has continued performing sporadically.",
