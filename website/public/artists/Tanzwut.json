  "name": "Tanzwut",
  "description": "'''Tanzwut''' ({{IPA|de|ˈtantsvuːt}}) is a German [[Medieval metal]] and [[Neue Deutsche Härte]] band that originated as a side project of [[Corvus Corax (band)|Corvus Corax]] members. The band uses a [[Medieval]] theme during their live performances which are expressed through their [[stagecraft]], costumes and [[choreography]].\n\nTheir name is the German term for \"[[dancing mania]]\", but is directly translated with \"dance rage\". Tanzwut are known for their heavy use of [[bagpipes]], an unusual instrument for a metal band. The group has achieved international success, filling concert halls as far away from their home country as Mexico.\n\nSince ''Ihr wolltet Spass'', the band gravitated towards a more [[industrial metal]] approach, incorporating the use of more [[down-tuned guitar]]s, harsher vocals and darker atmospheres. On ''Weiße Nächte'' (\"White Nights\") though, Tanzwut completely removed its industrial sound for a more refined classical approach centered around bagpipes with a heavy metal sound. However, some of the industrial influence returned with ''Höllenfahrt'' (\"Hell Ride\") and the band have written material in a more traditional style similar to that of [[Corvus Corax (band)|Corvus Corax]] (''Morus et Diabolus'' and ''Eselsmesse'').",
