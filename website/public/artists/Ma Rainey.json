  "description": "'''Gertrude''' \"'''Ma'''\" '''Rainey''' ({{nee}} '''Pridgett'''; April 26, 1886 â€“ December 22, 1939) was an American [[blues]] singer and influential early-blues recording artist. Dubbed the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Mother of the Blues]]\", she bridged earlier [[vaudeville]] and the authentic expression of southern blues, influencing a generation of blues singers. Rainey was known for her powerful vocal abilities, energetic disposition, majestic phrasing, and a \"moaning\" style of singing. Her qualities are present and most evident in her early recordings \"Bo-Weevil Blues\" and \"Moonshine Blues\".\n\nGertrude Pridgett began performing as a teenager and became known as \"Ma\" Rainey after her marriage to Will \"Pa\" Rainey in 1904. They toured with the [[The Rabbit's Foot Company|Rabbit Foot Minstrels]] and later formed their own group, ''Rainey and Rainey, Assassinators of the Blues''. Her first recording was made in 1923. In the following five years, she made over 100 recordings, including \"[[Boll Weevil (song)|Bo-Weevil Blues]]\" (1923), \"Moonshine Blues\" (1923), \"[[See See Rider|See See Rider Blues]]\" (1925), the [[List of blues standards|blues standard]] \"Ma Rainey's [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]]\" (1927), and \"Soon This Morning\" (1927).\n\nRainey also collaborated with [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Thomas Dorsey]], [[Tampa Red]], and [[Louis Armstrong]], and toured and recorded with the Georgia Jazz Band. Touring until 1935, she then largely retired from performing and continued as a theater impresario in her hometown of [[Columbus, Georgia]], until her death four years later. She has been posthumously inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]], as well as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Rainey has been portrayed in several films including the 2020 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning film [[Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (film)|''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom'']]. In 2023, she was honored with the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].",
