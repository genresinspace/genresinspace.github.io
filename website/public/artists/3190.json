  "description": "'''Ithaka Darin Pappas''' (born July 8, 1966), known professionally as '''Ithaka''', is an American-born multidisciplinary artist of Greek ancestry who creates using music, writing, sculpture and photography (both as separate entities or using them in combination with each other). He has authored a collection of short stories, entitled ''Ravenshark Chronicles'' published in international magazines and periodicals, which have sometimes been the basis for his travel-oriented lyrical content. In a 2005 article for the magazine ''Waves'', journalist Ricardo Macario described Ithaka as \"The Miscellaneous Man\". In a 2008 review of Ithaka's sixth album ''Saltwater Nomad'', the online surf-culture platform [[Surfline]] stated that \"the artist effortlessly traverses at ease between all of his choses mediums of expression [music, sculpture, writing and photography]\", and that \"his life's journey is a soulful balancing act somewhere between the worlds of euphoric creation and aquatic diversion.\"",
