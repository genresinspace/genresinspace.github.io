The band were formed in 1966 by [[Mike Ratledge]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Kevin Ayers]], [[Daevid Allen]] and Larry Nowlin. Soft Machine were central in the [[Canterbury scene]]; they became one of the first British [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] acts, and later helped pioneer [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[jazz rock]]. Soft Machine's lineup has undergone many changes, and has included [[Andy Summers]], [[Hugh Hopper]], [[Elton Dean]], [[John Stanley Marshall|John Marshall]], [[Karl Jenkins]], [[Roy Babbington]] and [[Allan Holdsworth]]. {{As of|2025}}, the current lineup consists of [[John Etheridge]], [[Theo Travis]], [[Fred Thelonious Baker]] and [[Asaf Sirkis]]. The band's name originates from [[William S. Burroughs]]'s novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]''.\n\nThe band originated with its predecessor, [[The Wilde Flowers]]. After forming, Soft Machine originally dabbled with [[psychedelic pop]], releasing their debut studio album, [[The Soft Machine (Soft Machine album)|''The Soft Machine'']], in 1968, alongside the single \"[[Joy of a Toy (song)|Joy of a Toy]]\". The band's progressive roots stemmed from their second studio album, [[Volume Two (The Soft Machine album)|''Volume Two'']] (1969). The band fully established their signature sound with the album's [[Third (Soft Machine album)|''Third'']] (1970) and [[Fourth (album)|''Fourth'']] (1971). By 1971, Soft Machine became a purely instrumental band. This transition was followed by the 1972 album [[Fifth (Soft Machine album)|''Fifth'']], and the 1973 albums [[Six (Soft Machine album)|''Six'']] and [[Seven (Soft Machine album)|''Seven'']]. In 1975, the band released their eight studio album, [[Bundles (album)|''Bundles'']], followed by their then-final studio album, [[Softs (album)|''Softs'']] (1976). In 1978, the group broke up. \n\nIn 1980, the band briefly reunited and released their tenth studio album, [[Land of Cockayne (album)|''Land of Cockayne'']], in 1981. After breaking up again, and briefly reuniting in 1984, the group Soft Machine Legacy was formed in 2004, and released three studio albums, including their self-titled debut (2006), [[Steam (Soft Machine Legacy album)|''Steam'']] (2007), and [[Burden of Proof (Soft Machine Legacy album)|''Burden of Proof'']] (2013). The \"Legacy\" suffix was dropped in 2015, and they released two studio albums, [[Hidden Details|''Hidden Details'']] (2018) and ''Other Doors'' (2023). Though they have achieved little commercial success, critics consider Soft Machine to have been influential in rock music. Dave Lynch at [[AllMusic]] called them \"one of the most influential underground bands of their era\".{{toclimit|3}}",
