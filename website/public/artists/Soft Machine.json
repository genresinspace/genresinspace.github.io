  "description": "'''Soft Machine''' are  an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Canterbury]], Kent. The band were formed in 1966 by [[Mike Ratledge]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Kevin Ayers]], [[Daevid Allen]] and Larry Nowlin. Soft Machine were central in the [[Canterbury scene]]; they became one of the first British [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] acts, and later helped pioneer [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[jazz rock]]. Soft Machine's lineup has undergone many changes, and has included [[Andy Summers]], [[Hugh Hopper]], [[Elton Dean]], [[John Stanley Marshall|John Marshall]], [[Karl Jenkins]], [[Roy Babbington]] and [[Allan Holdsworth]]. {{As of|2025}}, the current lineup consists of [[John Etheridge]], [[Theo Travis]], [[Fred Thelonious Baker]] and [[Asaf Sirkis]]. The band's name originates from [[William S. Burroughs]]'s novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]''.\n\nOriginating from the band [[The Wilde Flowers]], Soft Machine began as a [[psychedelic rock]] band, releasing their [[The Soft Machine (Soft Machine album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1968. Their second album, [[Volume Two (The Soft Machine album)|''Volume Two'']] (1969), marked their move towards progressive rock and jazz rock, which was fully realised with the subsequent two albums, [[Third (Soft Machine album)|''Third'']] (1970) and [[Fourth (album)|''Fourth'']] (1971). By 1971, Soft Machine became a purely instrumental jazz rock band, continuing this direction across their subsequent albums, [[Fifth (Soft Machine album)|''Fifth'']] (1972), [[Six (Soft Machine album)|''Six'']], [[Seven (Soft Machine album)|''Seven'']] (both 1973), [[Bundles (album)|''Bundles'']] (1975), [[Softs (album)|''Softs'']] (1976), and [[Alive & Well: Recorded in Paris|''Alive & Well'']] (1978). \n\nThe band split in 1978, though two brief reunions occurred during the 1980s, first for the recording of the album [[Land of Cockayne (album)|''Land of Cockayne'']] (1981), and then for a few live shows in 1984. The group Soft Machine Legacy was formed in 2004, and released three studio albums, including their self-titled debut (2006), [[Steam (Soft Machine Legacy album)|''Steam'']] (2007), and [[Burden of Proof (Soft Machine Legacy album)|''Burden of Proof'']] (2013). The \"Legacy\" suffix was dropped in 2015, and they have since released two studio albums, [[Hidden Details|''Hidden Details'']] (2018) and ''Other Doors'' (2023). Though they have achieved little commercial success, critics consider Soft Machine to have been influential in rock music. Dave Lynch at [[AllMusic]] called them \"one of the most influential underground bands of their era\".{{toclimit|3}}",
