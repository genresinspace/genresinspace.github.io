  "name": "Benny Moré",
  "description": "'''Bartolomé Maximiliano Moré Gutiérrez''' (24 August 1919 – 19 February 1963), better known as '''Benny Moré''' (also spelled '''Beny Moré'''), was a Cuban singer, bandleader and songwriter. Due to his fluid [[tenor]] voice and his great expressivity, he was known variously as \"El Bárbaro del Ritmo\" and \"El Sonero Mayor\". Moré was a master of the {{lang|es|soneo}} &ndash; the art of vocal improvisation in [[son cubano]] &ndash; and many of his tunes developed this way. He often took part in ''controversias'' (vocal duels) with other singers, including [[Cheo Marquetti]] and [[Joseíto Fernández]]. Apart from ''son cubano'', Moré was a popular singer of [[guaracha]]s, [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|cha cha cha]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[son montuno]], and [[bolero]]s.\n\nMoré started his career with the [[Conjunto Matamoros|Trío Matamoros]] in the 1940s and after a tour in Mexico he decided to stay in the country. Both Moré and dancer [[Ninón Sevilla]] made their cinematic debut in 1946's ''Carita de cielo'', but Moré focused on his music career. In the late 1940s, he sang guaracha-mambos with [[Pérez Prado]], achieving great success. Moré returned to Cuba in 1952 and worked with [[Bebo Valdés]] and [[Ernesto Duarte Brito|Ernesto Duarte]]. In 1953, he formed the Banda Gigante, which became one of the leading Cuban big bands of the 1950s. He suffered from [[alcoholism]] and died of [[cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]] in 1963 at the age of 43.",
