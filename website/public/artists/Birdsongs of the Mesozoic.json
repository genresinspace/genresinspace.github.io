  "description": "'''Birdsongs of the Mesozoic''' is an American musical group founded in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, in 1980.\n\nThe music of Birdsongs of the Mesozoic is almost entirely [[instrumental rock|instrumental]], and incorporates many different musical elements; critic Rick Anderson writes, \"Very few bands have ever managed to straddle the worlds of [[contemporary music|modern classical]] music and [[rock music|rock]] as successfully as this one did.\" In his liner notes for their ''Beat of the Mesozoic'' EP, Boston rock critic [[Eric Van]] dubbed them \"the world's hardest-rocking [[chamber music]] quartet.\" Another memorable description came from Jim Sullivan of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'': \"classical-punk-jazz-car-wreck music.\"",
