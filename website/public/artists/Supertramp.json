  "description": "'''Supertramp''' were a British [[rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1970. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders [[Roger Hodgson]] (vocals, keyboards and guitars) and [[Rick Davies]] (vocals and keyboards), the group were distinguished for blending [[progressive rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] styles. The classic lineup, which lasted ten years from 1973 to 1983, consisted of Davies, Hodgson, [[Dougie Thomson]] (bass), [[Bob Siebenberg]] (drums) and [[John Helliwell]] (saxophone), after which the group's lineup changed numerous times, with Davies being the only constant member throughout its history.\n\nSupertramp found no success with their first two albums, but after a lineup change into what became their classic lineup, their third album, ''[[Crime of the Century (album)|Crime of the Century]]'' (1974), was their breakthrough. Initially a more experimental prog-rock group, they began moving towards a more pop-oriented sound with the album. The band reached their commercial peak with 1979's ''[[Breakfast in America]]'', which yielded the international top 10 singles \"[[The Logical Song]]\", \"[[Breakfast in America (song)|Breakfast in America]]\", \"[[Goodbye Stranger]]\" and \"[[Take the Long Way Home (Supertramp song)|Take the Long Way Home]]\". Their other top 40 hits included \"[[Dreamer (Supertramp song)|Dreamer]]\" (1974), \"[[Give a Little Bit]]\" (1977) and \"[[It's Raining Again]]\" (1982).\n\nIn 1982 Supertramp released ''[[...Famous Last Words...]]'', the last album to feature Hodgson, who left in 1983 to pursue a solo career. The band continued with Davies as the sole leader and released two more albums until 1988. After this, they disbanded for a time and periodically reformed in various configurations (always with Davies, and without Hodgson), recording and touring two further albums, ''[[Some Things Never Change]]'' (1997) and ''[[Slow Motion (Supertramp album)|Slow Motion]]'' (2002). Davies died in 2025.\n\nSupertramp attained significant popularity in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Australia. Their highest sales levels were in Canada, where they had two diamond-certified (ten-times platinum) albums (''Crime of the Century'' and ''Breakfast in America''), and their only number one singles anywhere (\"The Logical Song\" and \"Dreamer\") aside from \"[[It's Raining Again]]\" which reached number one in France. As of 2007, Supertramp album sales exceeded 60 million.",
