  "description": "'''Supertramp''' were a British [[rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1970. Marked by the individual songwriting of founders [[Roger Hodgson]] (vocals, keyboards and guitars) and [[Rick Davies]] (vocals and keyboards), the group were distinguished for blending [[progressive rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] styles. The classic lineup, which lasted ten years from 1973 to 1983, consisted of Davies, Hodgson, [[Dougie Thomson]] (bass), [[Bob Siebenberg]] (drums) and [[John Helliwell]] (saxophone), after which the group's lineup changed numerous times, with Davies eventually becoming the only constant member throughout its history.\n\nSupertramp found no success with their first two albums, but after a lineup change into what became their classic lineup, their third album, ''[[Crime of the Century (album)|Crime of the Century]]'' (1974), was their breakthrough. Initially a more experimental prog-rock group, they began moving towards a more pop-oriented sound with the album. The band reached their commercial peak with 1979's ''[[Breakfast in America]]'', which yielded the international top 10 singles \"[[The Logical Song]]\", \"[[Breakfast in America (song)|Breakfast in America]]\", \"[[Goodbye Stranger]]\" and \"[[Take the Long Way Home (Supertramp song)|Take the Long Way Home]]\". Their other top 40 hits included \"[[Dreamer (Supertramp song)|Dreamer]]\" (1974), \"[[Give a Little Bit]]\" (1977) and \"[[It's Raining Again]]\" (1982).\n\nIn 1982 Supertramp released ''[[...Famous Last Words...]]'', the last album to feature Hodgson, who left in 1983 to pursue a solo career. The band continued with Davies as the sole leader and released two more albums until 1988, after which they disbanded and periodically reformed in various configurations, recording and touring two further albums, ''[[Some Things Never Change]]'' (1997) and ''[[Slow Motion (Supertramp album)|Slow Motion]]'' (2002).\n\nSupertramp attained significant popularity in North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Their highest sales levels were in Canada, where they had two diamond-certified (ten-times platinum) albums (''Crime of the Century'' and ''Breakfast in America''), and their only number one singles anywhere (\"The Logical Song\" and \"Dreamer\"). As of 2007, Supertramp album sales exceeded 60 million.",
