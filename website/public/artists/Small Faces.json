  "description": "'''The Small Faces''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[London]], founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of singer/guitarist [[Steve Marriott]], bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], drummer [[Kenney Jones]] and keyboardist [[Jimmy Winston]], with [[Ian McLagan]] replacing Winston in 1966. The band were initially one of the most acclaimed and influential [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] groups of the mid-1960s, with hit singles such as \"[[Whatcha Gonna Do About It]]\" (1965), \"[[Sha-La-La-La-Lee]]\" and \"[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All or Nothing]]\" (both 1966). From 1967, they evolved into one of the UK's most successful [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands, achieving further hit singles including \"[[Here Come the Nice]]\", \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\", \"[[Tin Soldier (song)|Tin Soldier]]\" (all 1967) and \"[[Lazy Sunday (Small Faces song)|Lazy Sunday]]\" (1968), the latter taken from their critically-acclaimed [[concept album]] ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]'' (1968), which reached No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\nIn 1969, Marriott left to form [[Humble Pie]], while Lane, Jones and McLagan continued under the shortened name [[Faces (band)|the Faces]] with [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Ronnie Wood]]. Following the breakup of both the Faces and Humble Pie in 1975, the classic Marriott/Lane/McLagan/Jones line-up of the Small Faces re-formed after a re-release of \"Itchycoo Park\" became a top-ten hit. Lane left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by [[Rick Wills]] (later of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]). This line-up (dubbed Mk-II by Marriott) recorded one album, ''[[Playmates (album)|Playmates]]'' (1977), before adding former [[Wings (band)|Wings]] guitarist [[Jimmy McCulloch]] for a second reunion album, ''[[78 in the Shade]]'' (1978). The band split for a second and final time in 1978.\n\nThe Small Faces have been considered one of the early inspirations for{{spnd}}and even an early root of{{spnd}}the [[Britpop]] movement. English music journalist [[Jon Savage]] has called them \"the one Brit group that prefigures the early [[Sex Pistols]]\" (who themselves covered \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\"). In 2012, the Small Faces and their successor band the Faces were jointly inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].",
