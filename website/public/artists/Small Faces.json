  "description": "'''Small Faces''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[London]], founded in 1965. The group originally consisted of [[Steve Marriott]], [[Ronnie Lane]], [[Kenney Jones]] and [[Jimmy Winston]], with [[Ian McLagan]] replacing Winston as the band's [[keyboardist]] in 1966. The band were one of the most acclaimed and influential [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] groups of the 1960s, recording [[Chart-topper|hit songs]] such as \"[[Itchycoo Park]]\", \"[[Lazy Sunday (Small Faces song)|Lazy Sunday]]\", \"[[All or Nothing (Small Faces song)|All or Nothing]]\" and \"[[Tin Soldier (song)|Tin Soldier]]\", as well as their [[concept album]] ''[[Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake]]''. They evolved into one of the UK's most successful [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands until 1969.\n\nWhen Marriott left to form [[Humble Pie]], the remaining three members collaborated with [[Ronnie Wood]], Wood's older brother [[Art Wood]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Kim Gardner]], briefly continuing under the name Quiet Melon, and then, with the departure of Art Wood and Gardner, as the [[Faces (band)|Faces]]. In North America, the Faces' debut album was credited to Small Faces.\n\nFollowing the breakup of both the Faces and Humble Pie in 1975, the classic line-up of Small Faces, consisting of Marriott, Lane, McLagan and Jones, re-formed after a re-release of \"Itchycoo Park\" became a top-ten hit. Lane left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by [[Rick Wills]] (later of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]). This line-up (dubbed Mk-II by Marriott) recorded one album [[Playmates (album)|''Playmates'']] before recruiting [[Jimmy McCulloch]]. This five-piece line-up released only ''[[78 in the Shade]]'' before breaking up.\n\nSmall Faces have been considered one of the early inspirations for{{spnd}}and even an early root of{{spnd}}the later [[Britpop]] movement. English music journalist [[Jon Savage]] has called them \"the one Brit group that prefigures the early [[Sex Pistols]]\". The Sex Pistols covered Small Faces' \"[[Whatcha Gonna Do About It]]\", and their member [[Glen Matlock]] performed with a reformed version of successor band [[Faces (band)|Faces]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012.",
