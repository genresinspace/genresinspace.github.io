  "description": "'''The Rolling Stones''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1962. Active for over six decades, they are one of the most popular, influential, and enduring bands of the [[Album era|rock era]]. In the early 1960s, the band pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define [[hard rock]]. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist [[Mick Jagger]], guitarist [[Keith Richards]], multi-instrumentalist [[Brian Jones]], bassist [[Bill Wyman]], and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. During their early years, Jones was the primary leader. [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became their manager in 1963 and encouraged them to write their own songs. The [[Jagger–Richards|Jagger–Richards partnership]] soon became the band's primary songwriting and creative force.\n\nRooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the Rolling Stones started out playing [[Cover version|covers]] and were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. They then found greater success with their own material, as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\", \"[[Get Off of My Cloud]]\" (both 1965), and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" (1966) became international number-one [[Hit song|hits]]. ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966), their first entirely original album, is often considered to be the most important of their early albums. In 1967, they had the [[A-side and B-side|double-sided]] hit \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\"/\"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" and experimented with [[psychedelic rock]] on ''[[Their Satanic Majesties Request]]''. By the end of the 1960s, they had returned to their [[rhythm and blues]]-based rock sound, with hit singles \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]\" (1968) and \"[[Honky Tonk Women]]\" (1969), and albums ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), featuring \"[[Sympathy for the Devil]]\" and \"[[Street Fighting Man]]\", and ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), featuring \"[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]\" and \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\".\n\nJones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, and was replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. That year they were first introduced on stage as \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|the greatest rock and roll band in the world]]\". ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), which yielded \"[[Brown Sugar (Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" and \"[[Wild Horses (Rolling Stones song)|Wild Horses]]\" and included the first usage of their [[tongue and lips logo]], was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. It was followed by ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972), featuring \"[[Tumbling Dice]]\" and \"[[Happy (Rolling Stones song)|Happy]]\", and ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' (1973), featuring \"[[Angie (song)|Angie]]\". Taylor left the band at the end of 1974 and was replaced by [[Ronnie Wood]]. The band released ''[[Some Girls]]'' in 1978, featuring \"[[Miss You (Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]\" and \"[[Beast of Burden (song)|Beast of Burden]]\", and ''[[Tattoo You]]'' in 1981, featuring \"[[Start Me Up]]\". ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989) was widely considered a [[Comeback (publicity)|comeback album]] and was followed by ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'' (1994). Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007, they had broken the record for the all-time [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]] three times, and they were the highest-earning live act of 2021. Following Wyman's departure in 1993, the band continued as a four-piece core, with [[Darryl Jones]] becoming their regular bassist, and then as a three-piece core following Watts' death in 2021, with [[Steve Jordan (drummer)|Steve Jordan]] becoming their regular drummer. ''[[Hackney Diamonds]]'', the band's first new album of original material in 18 years, was released in October 2023, becoming their [[List of artists by number of UK Albums Chart number ones|fourteenth UK number-one album]].\n\nThe Rolling Stones have estimated album sales of more than 250&nbsp;million. They have won three [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' have ranked them as one of the greatest artists of all time.",
