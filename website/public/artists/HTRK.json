  "description": "'''HTRK''' (pronounced \"hate rock\", formerly '''Hate Rock Trio''') is an Australian band formed in 2003. The band is currently a duo of vocalist Jonnine Standish and guitarist Nigel Yang; bassist Sean Stewart was a member until his death in 2010. \n\nThe band's debut album was produced by [[Rowland S. Howard]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' described their early work as \"defined by aggressive, guitar-driven noise, which was matched in spirit by Standishâ€™s haunted, brazenly sexual lyrics.\" [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] noted how since Stewart's death, the band \"shed the cold, industrial leanings of their earlier releases for a more overtly sensual approach, something that could soundtrack moments of intimacy or ennui, or both.\"",
