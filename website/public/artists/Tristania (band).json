  "description": "'''Tristania''' was a Norwegian [[gothic metal]] band formed in 1996 by [[Morten Veland]], Einar Moen and Kenneth Olsson. Tristania's music is usually classified as [[gothic metal]] with [[death/doom|death]] influences, due to its strong tie and legacy within the [[gothic metal]] history. Their songs largely dealt with dark and sentimental topics, including depression, sadness, suicide, love, absence, and anger.\n\nThe band had not had any known activity from 2016 to October 2018, when they announced that they would perform at [[70000 Tons of Metal]] in early 2019. In 2022, they announced they had disbanded.",
