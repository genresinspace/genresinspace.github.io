  "description": "'''Yoruba Andabo''' is a [[Cuban rumba]] ensemble founded in 1981 by [[conga]] drummer [[Pancho Quinto]]. It evolved from an amateur group known as '''Guaguancó Marítimo Portuario''', established in 1961 in the docks of [[Havana]]. Together with Los Chinitos, Yoruba Andabo is one of the leading exponents of the [[guarapachangueo]] style of Cuban rumba, which incorporated Quinto's rhythmic ideas for [[batá]] and [[cajón de rumba|cajón]] (wooden box).\n\nYoruba Andabo's popularity increased throughout the 1980s, gaining exposure with the 1986 documentary ''El país de los oricha''. The band gained international attention after their involvement in [[Jane Bunnett]]'s album ''Spirits of Havana'' (recorded in 1991 and released in 1993), which was followed by the release of their 1993 album ''El callejón de los rumberos'' in North America in 1996. In 1995 they recorded ''Aché IV'' with [[Merceditas Valdés]].\n\nAround 1997 Quinto left Yoruba Andabo to record his first solo album ''En el solar la cueva del humo'' and continued collaborating with Jane Bunnett and other artists until his death in 2005. Meanwhile, Yoruba Andabo continued performing and making recordings. In 2005, they released ''Rumba en la Habana''. Their latest albums are ''El espíritu de la rumba'' (2013), ''Soy de la tierra brava'' (2016) and ''Seguimos sonando'' (2021).",
