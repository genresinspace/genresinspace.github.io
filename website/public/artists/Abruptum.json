It is run by Evil (Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson) of [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], but the band was formed in 1989 by IT (a.k.a. [[Tony Särkkä]]). All (a.k.a. Jim Berger), Ext and Evil joined the band later.  IT was one of the leaders of the True Satanist Horde, part of the Swedish Black metal scene. [[Euronymous]], co-founder of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and founder of [[Deathlike Silence Productions]], described Abruptum as \"the audial essence of pure black evil\". Conversely, Joe DaVita of ''[[Loudwire]]'' described the cover artwork to the band's 1995 release ''Evil Genius'' as \"look[ing] like when the mainstream spoofs black metal.\"",
