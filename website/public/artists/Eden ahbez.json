  "description": "'''George Alexander Aberle''' (April 15, 1908 â€“ March 4, 1995), known as '''eden ahbez''', was an American songwriter and recording artist of the 1940s to 1960s, whose lifestyle in California was influential in the [[hippie]] movement.  He was known to friends simply as '''ahbe'''.\n\nAhbez composed the song \"[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]\", which became a No. 1 hit for eight weeks in 1948 for [[Nat \"King\" Cole]]. Living a [[pastoral|bucolic]] life from at least the 1940s, he traveled in sandals and wore shoulder-length hair and beard, and white robes. He camped out below the first L in the [[Hollywood Sign]] above Los Angeles and studied Asian  [[mysticism]]. He slept outdoors with his family and ate vegetables, fruit, and nuts. He claimed to live on $3 per week.",
