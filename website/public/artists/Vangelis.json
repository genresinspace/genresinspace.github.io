He composed the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning score to ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981), as well as for the films ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' (1982), ''[[Antarctica (1983 film)|Antarctica]]'' (1983), ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984), ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992), and ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'' (2004), and the 1980 [[PBS]] documentary series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' by [[Carl Sagan]].\n\nBorn in [[Agria]] and raised in [[Athens]], Vangelis began his career in the 1960s as a member of the rock bands the Forminx and [[Aphrodite's Child]]; the latter's album ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' (1972) is recognised as a [[progressive rock|progressive]]-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] rock classic. Vangelis settled in Paris, and gained initial recognition for his scores to the [[Frédéric Rossif]] animal documentaries ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des Animaux]]}}'', ''{{lang|fr|[[La Fête sauvage]]}}'', and ''{{lang|fr|[[Opéra sauvage]]}}''. He released his first solo albums during this time, and performed as a solo artist. In 1975, Vangelis relocated to London where he built his home recording facility named [[Nemo Studios]] and released a series of successful and influential albums for [[RCA Records]], including ''[[Heaven and Hell (Vangelis album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1975), ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'' (1976), ''[[Spiral (Vangelis album)|Spiral]]'' (1977), and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]'' (1979). From 1979 to 1986, Vangelis performed in a duo with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] vocalist [[Jon Anderson]], releasing several albums as [[Jon and Vangelis]]. He collaborated with [[Irene Papas]] on two albums of Greek traditional and religious songs.\n\nVangelis reached his commercial peak in the 1980s and 1990s. His [[Chariots of Fire (album)|score]] for ''Chariots of Fire'' (1981) won him an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and the film's main theme, \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire – Titles]]\" went to number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, while his score for ''1492: Conquest of Paradise'' (1992) was nominated for a [[50th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]] and the film's [[1492: Conquest of Paradise (album)|soundtrack]] and [[Conquest of Paradise (song)|main theme]] topped the European charts selling millions of copies. His compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'' (1989), ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)]]'' (1996), and studio album ''[[Voices (Vangelis album)|Voices]]'' (1995) sold well. Vangelis composed [[Anthem (Vangelis song)|the official anthem]] of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] held in Korea and Japan. In his last twenty years, Vangelis collaborated with [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] on music projects ''[[Mythodea]]'' (1993), ''[[Rosetta (album)|Rosetta]]'' (2016), and ''[[Juno to Jupiter]]'' (2021), his 23rd and final studio album.\n\nHaving had a career in music spanning over 50 years and having composed and performed more than 50 albums, Vangelis is one of the most important figures in the history of [[electronic music]], and modern film music. He used many electronic instruments in a fashion of a \"one-man quasi-classical orchestra\" composing and performing on the first take.\n\nHe died May 17, 2022, at age 79, of heart failure at a hospital in Paris.",
