  "description": "'''INXS''' (a [[word play|phonetic play]] on \"in excess\") were an Australian rock band, formed as '''the Farriss Brothers''' in 1977 in Sydney. The founding members were bassist [[Garry Gary Beers]], main composer and keyboardist [[Andrew Farriss]], drummer [[Jon Farriss]], guitarist [[Tim Farriss]], lead singer and main lyricist [[Michael Hutchence]], and guitarist and saxophonist [[Kirk Pengilly]]. For 20&nbsp;years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their [[New wave music|new wave]]/pop style, the band later developed a harder [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] style that included [[funk]] and dance elements.\n\nIn 1984, INXS had their first number-one hit in Australia with \"[[Original Sin (INXS song)|Original Sin]]\". The band achieved international success in the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s with the hit albums ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]'', ''[[Kick (INXS album)|Kick]]'', and ''[[X (INXS album)|X]]'', and the singles \"[[What You Need (INXS song)|What You Need]]\", \"[[Need You Tonight]]\" (the band's only US number-one single), \"[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]\", \"[[Never Tear Us Apart]]\", \"[[Suicide Blonde]]\" and \"[[New Sensation]]\".\n\nAfter Hutchence's death on 22 November 1997, INXS made appearances with several guest singers, and toured and recorded with [[Jon Stevens]] as lead singer, beginning in 2000. In 2005, members of INXS participated in ''[[Rock Star: INXS]]'', a reality television series that culminated in the selection of Canadian [[J.D. Fortune]] as their new lead singer. Irish singer-songwriter [[Ciaran Gribbin]] replaced Fortune as lead singer in 2011. During a concert on 11 November 2012, INXS stated that the performance would be their last, although they did not announce the band's permanent retirement.\n\nINXS has won six [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) awards, including three for \"Best Group\" in 1987, 1989 and 1992; the band was inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] in 2001. INXS has sold over 75&nbsp;million albums worldwide, making them one of Australia's highest selling music acts of all time.",
