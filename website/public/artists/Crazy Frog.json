  "description": "'''Crazy Frog''' (originally known as '''The Annoying Thing''') is a Swedish CGI-animated character and [[Eurodance]] musician created in 2003 by actor and playwright Erik Wernquist. Marketed by the [[ringtone]] provider [[Jamba!]], the character was originally created to accompany a sound effect produced by Daniel Malmedahl while attempting to imitate the sound of a [[two-stroke engine]].\n\nThe Crazy Frog spawned a worldwide hit single with a cover version of the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' theme tune \"[[Axel F]]\", which reached the number one spot in Turkey, New Zealand, Australia and most of Europe. The subsequent album ''[[Crazy Hits|Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits]]'' and second single \"[[Popcorn (instrumental)#Crazy Frog version|Popcorn]]\" also enjoyed worldwide chart success, and a second album entitled ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits]]'' was released in 2006, as well as a third album, ''[[Everybody Dance Now (album)|Everybody Dance Now]]'', released in 2009. The Crazy Frog also spawned many singles, a range of merchandise and toys, as well as two video games before going on hiatus in 2009.\n\nOn 22 April 2020, a Twitter account for the character was created, and the account is listed on the official website, Facebook profile and YouTube channel. A new album was announced later that same day. On 10 December 2021, a new single, \"Tricky\", was released after a 12-year hiatus.",
