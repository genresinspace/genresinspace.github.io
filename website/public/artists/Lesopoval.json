  "description": "'''Lesopoval''' ({{langx|ru|Лесопова́л}} {{IPA|ru|lʲɪsəpɐˈvaɫ|pron}}, translated as \"tree felling\" or \"logging camp\", a symbol of Siberian labor camps and also of the forced labor within the camps) is a Russian band formed in 1990 by [[Mikhail Tanich]] and [[Sergey Korzhukov]]. Their music is in the style of [[Russian chanson]], which is music from the perspective of the criminal underworld. The hero of many of their songs is often a criminal or ex-[[convict]], and their songs contain many references to the way such \"marginalized\" persons live. The songs in many way romanticize the life of criminals, many of them taking place in and concerning labor camps and prison.\n\nMikhail Tanich wrote the lyrics to every song the group performed until his death on April 17, 2008. In writing the lyrics to the songs Lesopoval performed, Mikhail Tanich drew on the six years he spent in a Soviet labor camp, during which time he came to empathize with criminals from all walks of life. In total, the group released at least 19 albums, including one after Mikhail Tanich's death. Until his death in 1994, Sergey Korzhukov wrote the musical melodies and performed most of the songs; after his death, other artists wrote and performed the melodies. Musically, most songs feature a [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], [[accordion]]s, and are often performed with strong vocals.",
