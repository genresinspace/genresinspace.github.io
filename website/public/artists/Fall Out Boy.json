  "description": "'''Fall Out Boy''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Wilmette, Illinois]], a suburb of [[Chicago]], in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist [[Patrick Stump]], bassist [[Pete Wentz]], lead guitarist [[Joe Trohman]], and drummer [[Andy Hurley]]. The band originated from Chicago's [[hardcore punk]] scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a [[pop-punk]] side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, ''[[Take This to Your Grave]]'' (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fan base through heavy touring.\n\nWith Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'', produced two hit singles, \"[[Sugar, We're Goin Down]]\" and \"[[Dance, Dance (Fall Out Boy song)|Dance, Dance]]\". It went [[RIAA certification|double platinum]], transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] nomination at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards|2006 Grammy Awards]]. ''[[Infinity on High]]'' (2007) debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 260,000 first week sales.

Their following album, ''[[Folie à Deux (album)|Folie à Deux]]'' (2008), was a commercial disappointment and received a mixed response. Following the release of ''[[Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits]]'' in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the members worked on side projects.\n\nThe band reunited with ''[[Save Rock and Roll]]'' (2013), which became Fall Out Boy's second number-one album, and included the top 20 single \"[[My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)]]\". The same year, the band released the EP ''[[PAX AM Days]]'', consisting of eight punk-influenced tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer [[Ryan Adams]]. The band's sixth studio album, ''[[American Beauty/American Psycho]]'' (2015) peaked at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and spawned the top-10 hit \"[[Centuries (song)|Centuries]]\" and the single \"[[Uma Thurman (song)|Uma Thurman]]\" which reached No.&nbsp;22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This was followed by their first remix album ''[[Make America Psycho Again]]'', which featured remixes of all original tracks from ''American Beauty/American Psycho'' by a different artist on each song, including [[Migos]] and [[Wiz Khalifa]].\n\nThe band's seventh studio album ''[[Mania (Fall Out Boy album)|Mania]]'' (2018), also peaked at No.&nbsp;1, making it the band's fourth No.&nbsp;1 album and sixth consecutive Top 10 album.
