  "description": "'''Jacula''' was an Italian [[rock music|rock]] band founded in the late 1960s{{when|date=May 2025}} in [[Milan]] as an experiment by [[Antonio Bartoccetti]], [[Doris Norton]], [[organist]] Charles Tiring and [[Mediumship|medium]] Franz Porthenzy.\n\nJacula's music was considered innovative for the time in progressive circles but considered dark and strange by most fans and analysts of the genre, especially in an era that included the development of groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Gentle Giant]], bands which were the basis of the then new progressive rock scene.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nBecause the band was experimental, and had been labeled by founder Antonio Bartoccetti as a ''youth mistake''{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, Jacula's discography is relatively small.\n\nThe group completed three albums, ''[[Tardo Pede In Magiam Versus]]'' in 1972, [[Pre Viam]] in May, 2011 and ''[[In Cauda Semper Stat Venenum]]'', which release date is still debated.\n\nTardo Pede In Magiam Versus featured Fiamma Dello Spirito's vocals, with a sound influenced by bands of the Italian underground scene such as [[Le Orme]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}. In the 1970s, Jacula changed their name to [[Antonius Rex]], maintaining the same lineup, until the release of Pre Viam.",
