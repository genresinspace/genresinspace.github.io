  "description": "'''Benjamin Hammond Haggerty''' (born June 19, 1983), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Macklemore''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|k|l|ə|m|ɔr}} {{respell|MAK|lə|mor}}; formerly '''Professor Macklemore'''), is an American rapper. A native of [[Seattle, Washington]], he started his career in 2000 as an independent artist releasing: ''Open Your Eyes'' (2000), ''The Language of My World'' (2005), and ''The Unplanned Mixtape'' (2009). He rose to international success collaborating with producer [[Ryan Lewis]] as the duo [[Macklemore & Ryan Lewis]] (2009–2016).\n\nMacklemore's and Lewis's single \"[[Thrift Shop]]\" (featuring [[Wanz]]) reached number one on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2013. The single was dubbed by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the first song since 1994 to top the Hot 100 chart without the support of a major record label; however, Macklemore, in a slightly unusual [[recording contract]], pays a nominal percentage of sales to use [[Warner Bros. Records]]'s radio promotion department to push his singles. Their second single, \"[[Can't Hold Us]]\", also peaked at number one on the Hot 100 chart, making Macklemore and Lewis the first duo in the chart's history to have their first two singles both reach the peak position. Their debut studio album ''[[The Heist (album)|The Heist]]'' was released on October 9, 2012, and charted at number 2 on the [[U.S. Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]]. The duo won four [[Grammy Awards]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards|2014 ceremony]], including [[Best New Artist]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] (''The Heist''), [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] (\"Thrift Shop\"). The pair's second album, ''[[This Unruly Mess I've Made]]'', was released on February 26, 2016.\n\nIn June 2017, Macklemore released \"[[Glorious (Macklemore song)|Glorious]]\", a single featuring [[Skylar Grey]], which marked his return to the music industry as well as his first major single produced without Lewis since his mainstream breakthrough. Macklemore released a second solo studio album, ''[[Gemini (Macklemore album)|Gemini]]'', in September of that year. On February 24, 2023, he released a follow-up album entitled ''[[Ben (Macklemore album)|Ben]]''.",
