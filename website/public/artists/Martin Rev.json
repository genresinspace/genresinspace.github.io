  "description": "'''Martin Reverby''', better known by his stage name '''Martin Rev''', (born December 18, 1947) is an American musician who was one half of the influential [[synth-punk]] band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]]. Rev has also released several solo albums for a number of record labels, including [[ROIR]] and Puu.  His style varies widely from release to release, from harsh and abrasive [[no wave]] (''Martin Rev'') to light [[bubblegum pop]] (''Strangeworld'') to heavy [[electronic rock|synthesizer rock]] (''To Live'').\n\nHe was a student of [[Lennie Tristano]]. \n\nRev also works with [[Stefan Roloff]], doing soundtracks for Roloff's video work. He contributed to [[the Raveonettes]]' 2005 album, ''[[Pretty in Black]]''.\n\nIn 2008, while Rev was working on the album ''Stigmata'', his wife Mari died. The album, dedicated to her, is strong in religious imagery with most songs being titled in [[Latin]]. [[Kris Needs]] called the album a \"brilliantly executed excursion into modern electronic classical music\".",
