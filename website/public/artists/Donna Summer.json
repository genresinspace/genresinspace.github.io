  "name": "Donna Summer",
  "description": "'''Donna Adrian Gaines''' (December 31, 1948{{spaced ndash}}May 17, 2012), known professionally as '''Donna Summer''', was an American singer and songwriter. She gained prominence during the [[disco]] era of the 1970s and became known as the \"[[Queen of Disco]]\", while her music gained a global following.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Boston]], Summer dropped out of high school before graduating and began her career as the lead singer of a [[blues rock]] band named Crow and moved to New York City. In 1968, she joined the German adaptation of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in Munich, where she spent several years living, acting, and singing. There, she met music producers [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Pete Bellotte]], and released her first album, the European market-only ''[[Lady of the Night (album)|Lady of the Night]]'' in 1974. Following the recording and European release of the groundbreaking [[disco]] anthem, \"[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]\", she signed with [[Casablanca Records]] in 1975, where it was released in North America. In the US, the single became her first top five hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 2 in 1976. Summer's first three Casablanca albums — ''[[Love to Love You Baby (album)|Love to Love You Baby]]'', ''[[A Love Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Four Seasons of Love]]'' — all went gold in the US and established her as the \"First Lady of Love\". Her fourth Casablanca release, ''[[I Remember Yesterday]]'' (1977), boosted the top ten US and number one UK hit, \"[[I Feel Love]]\", which has since been hailed as one of the most important records in [[pop music]] history. After recording much of her first six albums in Munich with Moroder and Belotte, Summer and the producers relocated to the United States, where Summer would continue to record successful singles such as \"[[Last Dance (Donna Summer song)|Last Dance]]\", [[MacArthur Park (song)#Donna Summer version|MacArthur Park]]\", \"[[Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)|Heaven Knows]]\", \"[[Hot Stuff (Donna Summer song)|Hot Stuff]]\", \"[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer song)|Bad Girls]]\", \"[[Dim All the Lights]]\", \"[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]\" with [[Barbra Streisand]], and \"[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]\".\n\nStarting in 1978, Summer first topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with the [[live album]], ''[[Live and More]]'', thus beginning a streak of three consecutive number one albums, including ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' (1979) and the compilation album, ''[[On the Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes I & II]]'' (1980). In achieving this, Summer became the first and only artist to have three number one [[double albums]]. All three albums was certified platinum or higher in the United States, with ''Bad Girls'' selling over two million copies. Summer was the first female artist to record three number one singles in one calendar year, doing so in 1979. Summer's success was interrupted by the [[disco backlash|fallout of disco music]] and in 1980, she left Casablanca Records for [[Geffen Records]]. As a response, her next album, ''[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|The Wanderer]]'', found Summer recording mostly [[rock music|rock]] and [[new wave music]], as well as [[inspirational music]], inspired by her [[born again|newfound faith in Christianity]]. However, her Geffen Records recordings were not as successful as predicted. Summer returned to the top of the pop charts in 1983 with the single, \"[[She Works Hard for the Money]]\", off the [[She Works Hard for the Money (album)|album of the same name]], which was released off of [[Mercury Records]] after it was found she owed Casablanca one more album. Despite this success, Summer's recordings began floundering not too long afterwards. Rumors of alleged [[homophobia|homophobic]] comments made during and after a concert in 1983 led to a fallout with Summer's [[LGBTQ community|gay fanbase]]. In 1989, Summer worked with the team of [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] and scored her first top ten US hit in six years with \"[[This Time I Know It's for Real]]\", which would be her fourteenth and final top ten hit of her career. Summer would make the Hot 100 one last time in 1999 with her rendition of \"I Will Go with You ([[Con te partirò]])\".\n\nSummer continued to record music up until her death in 2012 from lung cancer at her home in [[Naples, Florida]]. In her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', she was described as the \"undisputed queen of the Seventies disco boom\" who reached the status of \"one of the world's leading female singers.\" Moroder described Summer's work on the song \"I Feel Love\" as \"really the start of [[electronic dance]]\" music. Summer has been inducted into several musical institutions during her lifetime and posthumously, including the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]] and the [[National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]]. In 2013, a year after her death, Summer was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked her sixth on its list of the \"Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists\".",
