  "description": "'''Simon & Garfunkel''' were an American [[folk rock]] duo comprising the singer-songwriter [[Paul Simon]] and the singer [[Art Garfunkel]]. They were one of the best-selling music acts of the 1960s. Their most famous recordings include three US number-one singles — \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" and the two [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] winners \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\" and \"[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]\"— as well as \"[[Homeward Bound (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Homeward Bound]]\", \"[[I Am a Rock]]\", \"[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)#Simon & Garfunkel version|Scarborough Fair/Canticle]]\", \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", \"[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]\", \"[[The Boxer]]\" and \"[[Cecilia (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]\".\n\nSimon and Garfunkel met in elementary school in [[Queens]], New York City, in 1953, where they learned to [[harmonize]] and Simon began writing songs. As teenagers, under the name Tom & Jerry, they had minor success with \"Hey Schoolgirl\" (1957), a song imitating their idols, the [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]]. In 1963, they regrouped and were signed to [[Columbia Records]] as Simon & Garfunkel. Their debut album, ''[[Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.]]'' (1964), sold poorly; Simon returned to a solo career, this time in England. In 1965, a remixed version of \"The Sound of Silence\", became a US [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] hit, reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They released their second album, ''[[Sounds of Silence]]'', in 1966, and toured colleges nationwide. They assumed more creative control on their ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', released in 1966. Their music featured prominently in [[Mike Nichols]]'s 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'', and in 1968 the [[The Graduate (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] and the duo's fourth album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]],'' featuring the hit version of \"Mrs. Robinson\", alternated at number one on the [[List of Billboard 200 number-one albums of 1968|''Billboard'' Top 200]].\n\nSimon and Garfunkel had a troubled relationship, leading to artistic disagreements and their breakup in 1970. Their final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'', released that January, became [[List of best-selling albums|one of the world's best-selling albums]]. Following their split, Simon had a successful solo career, releasing albums including the acclaimed ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' (1986). Garfunkel released successful singles such as \"[[All I Know]]\" (1973) and \"[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]\" (1975) and \"[[Bright Eyes (Art Garfunkel song)|Bright Eyes]]\" ([[1979 in British music|Britain's top single of 1979]]), and pursued acting, with leading roles in the Mike Nichols films ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970) and ''[[Carnal Knowledge (film)|Carnal Knowledge]]'' (1971) and in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s ''[[Bad Timing]]'' (1980). The duo have reunited several times; their 1981 [[The Concert in Central Park|concert in Central Park]] may have attracted more than 500,000 people, one of the [[List of most-attended concerts|largest concert attendances in history]].\n\nSimon & Garfunkel won seven [[Grammy Awards]]—plus four [[Grammy Hall of Fame|Grammy Hall of Fame Awards]]—and in 1990 were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].
