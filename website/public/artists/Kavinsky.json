  "description": "'''Vincent Belorgey''' (born 31 July 1975), known professionally as '''Kavinsky''', is a French musician, producer, DJ, and actor. His production style is reminiscent of the [[electropop]] film soundtracks of the 1980s. Kavinsky says that his music is inspired by thousands of movies he watched as a young boy and that he has cherry-picked the best parts from them, consolidating them into one concept. Kavinsky has been compared to many similar [[French house]] artists, including [[Danger (musician)|Danger]] and French duo [[Daft Punk]]. He achieved greater mainstream recognition after his song \"[[Nightcall (song)|Nightcall]]\" was featured in the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''. His debut studio album, ''[[OutRun (album)|OutRun]]'', was released in 2013.",
