  "description": "'''Callen Radcliffe Tjader Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|d|ər}} {{Respell|JAY|dər}}; July 16, 1925 – May 5, 1982) was an American [[Latin Jazz]] musician, often described as the most successful non-Latino [[Latin music (genre)|Latin musician]]. He explored other jazz idioms, especially small group [[modern jazz]], even as he continued to perform music of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America.\n\nAlthough his main instrument was the [[vibraphone]], Tjader was also accomplished on the [[Drum kit|drums]], [[bongo drum|bongos]], [[conga]]s, [[timbales]], and the [[piano]]. He worked with many musicians from several cultures. He is often linked to the development of [[Latin rock]] and [[acid jazz]]. Although the fusion of Jazz with Latin music is often pigeonholed as \"Latin Jazz\", Tjader's works swung freely between both styles. His [[Grammy]] award in 1980 for his album ''La Onda Va Bien'' capped off a career that spanned over 40 years.",
