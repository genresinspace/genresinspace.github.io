  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''Casiopea''' |カシオペア|Kashiopea}} is a Japanese [[jazz fusion]] band formed in 1976 by guitarist [[Issei Noro]] and bassist [[Tetsuo Sakurai]]. After lineup changes the following year that added keyboardist [[Minoru Mukaiya]], Casiopea made their major‑label debut with their self‑titled album in 1979, and drummer [[Akira Jimbo]] joined in 1980.\n\nDuring this period, they released more than a dozen albums before Sakurai and Jimbo left the band amid disputes over concurrent band memberships. In 1990, bassist {{Ill|Yoshihiro Naruse|ja|鳴瀬喜博}} and drummer {{ill|Masaaki Hiyama|ja|日山正明}} joined, resulting in a second era marked by multiple drummer changes, with Jimbo returning as a supporting member in 1997. Noro suspended all band activities in 2006, leading to a six-year hiatus.\n\nIn 2012, the band resumed activities without Mukaiya rejoining and {{Ill|Kiyomi Otaka|ja|大髙清美}} replacing him on keyboards. Renamed '''Casiopea 3rd''' for its third period, the group recorded its first album in eight years. After Jimbo left again in 2022, he was replaced by drummer Yoshinori Imai and the band entered its fourth period as '''Casiopea‑P4'''. Otaka left in 2025 and was replaced by keyboardist {{Ill|Jun Abe (pianist)|lt=Jun Abe|ja|安部潤}}, and the band reverted to its original name.",
