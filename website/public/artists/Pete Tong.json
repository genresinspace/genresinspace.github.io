  "description": "'''Peter Michael Tong''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 30 July 1960) is an English DJ who works for [[BBC Radio 1]]. He is the host of programmes such as ''[[Essential Mix]]'' and ''[[Essential Selection]]'' on the radio service, which can be heard through [[Internet radio]] streams, for his record label [[FFRR Records]] and for his own performances at [[nightclub]]s and music festivals. Tong has also worked as a record producer and is regarded as the \"global ambassador for electronic music.\"\n\nThe phrase \"It's all gone Pete Tong\", where the name is used as [[rhyming slang]] for \"it's all gone wrong\", was reputedly coined by [[Paul Oakenfold]] in late 1987 in an article about [[acid house]] called \"Bermondsey Goes Balearic\" for [[Terry Farley]] and [[Pete Heller]]'s ''Boys Own'' fanzine. ''[[It's All Gone Pete Tong]]'' is also the title of a 2004 film which portrays a fictional DJ's experiences as he realizes he is becoming deaf. Tong appears briefly in the film. It is also the name Tong has adopted for his club night at the nightclub [[Pacha Group|Pacha]] in Ibiza and his nightly radio programme in the United States on [[iHeartRadio]]'s \"[[Evolution (HD radio)|Evolution]]\" EDM format platform.\n\nIn 2008, Tong was involved with organizing the [[International Music Summit]] in [[Ibiza]], an event that has become an annual fixture (the 2016 Summit was held during 25â€“27 May). In 2017, Tong won Radio Show of the Year at the [[Electronic Music Awards]] for \"The Essential Collection\".",
