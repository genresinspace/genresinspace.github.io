He is the founder of the former [[Musicland Studios]] in Munich, a recording studio used by many artists including [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Elton John]].

During this period, he also released many albums, including the synthesizer-driven ''[[From Here to Eternity (Giorgio Moroder album)|From Here to Eternity]]'' (1977) and ''[[E=MC² (Giorgio Moroder album)|E=MC<sup>2</sup>]]'' (1979).\n\nHe began to compose film soundtracks and scores, including ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'', ''[[American Gigolo (soundtrack)|American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Superman III (soundtrack)|Superman III]]'', ''[[Scarface (soundtrack)|Scarface]]'', ''[[The NeverEnding Story (song)|The NeverEnding Story]]'', and the 1984 restoration of ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)#Giorgio Moroder version (1984)|Metropolis]]''. Moroder's work on the film ''Midnight Express'' (1978), which contained the international hit \"[[Chase (instrumental)|Chase]]\", won him the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]]. He also produced a number of electronic disco songs for [[the Three Degrees]] and two albums for [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]]. In 1990, he composed \"[[Un'estate italiana]]\", the official theme song of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nMoroder has created songs for many performers including [[David Bowie]], [[Falco (musician)|Falco]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Irene Cara]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Madleen Kane]], [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[France Joli]].
