  "description": "'''Deftones''' is an American [[alternative metal]] band formed in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1988. They were formed by frontman [[Chino Moreno]], lead guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]] and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]], with bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] and keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] joining the line-up in 1990 and 1999, respectively. The band's [[experimental rock|experimental]] nature has led some critics to describe them as \"the [[Radiohead]] of metal\".\n\nAfter the line-up settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Extensive touring and [[word-of-mouth]] promotion of the album helped Deftones garner a dedicated fan base. Their second album, ''[[Around the Fur]]'' (1997), brought the band fame among the alternative metal scene and reached chart positions along with its singles. It became the band's first record to receive certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\nThe band found further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which marked a transition from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single \"[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]\" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track \"[[Elite (song)|Elite]]\" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to ''White Pony''. Deftones' fifth studio effort, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'' (2006), received similar praise, although the album's production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material.\n\nIn 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a [[minimally conscious state]] until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros'' and recruited [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]] until his departure in early 2021.{{efn|Despite appearing in promotional material during his tenure, Vega disputes his status as a full time member of the band, claiming that he was a member of the band only under contract.<ref name=\"Sergio Vega1\">{{ Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/deftones-sergio-vega-quit-1318765/|title=Why Deftones Bassist Sergio Vega Quit: 'There Was No Opportunity for Growth'|first=Kory|last=Grow|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=February 13, 2024}}</ref><ref name=\"Sergio Vega2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deftones-part-ways-with-longtime-bassist-sergio-vega/|title=Deftones Part Ways With Longtime Bassist Sergio Vega|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=March 9, 2022|language=en-US}}</ref>}} The band released the critically celebrated ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' in 2010 and embarked on a [[Blackdiamondskye|triple-headline tour]] with [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' (2012) and ''[[Gore (Deftones album)|Gore]]'' (2016) respectively, saw the band continue to move in an increasingly experimental direction and were released to critical acclaim. Their latest album, ''[[Ohms (album)|Ohms]]'' (2020), received significant critical praise for its return to the band's heavier sound.",
