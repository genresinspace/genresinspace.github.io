  "description": "'''Deftones''' is an American [[alternative metal]] band formed in [[Sacramento, California]], in 1988. They were formed by frontman [[Chino Moreno]], lead guitarist [[Stephen Carpenter]] and drummer [[Abe Cunningham]], with bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] and keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] joining the lineup in 1990 and 1999, respectively. \n\nAfter the lineup settled in 1993, Deftones secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Extensive touring and [[word-of-mouth]] promotion of the album helped Deftones garner a dedicated fan base. Their second album, ''[[Around the Fur]]'' (1997), was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in the US. The band found further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which marked a transition from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction; its track \"[[Elite (song)|Elite]]\" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]. Their [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003 and debuted at number 2 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Deftones' fifth studio album, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'' (2006) was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material.\n\nIn 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a [[minimally conscious state]] until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros'' and recruited [[Quicksand (American band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]] until his departure in early 2021.{{efn|Despite appearing in promotional material during his tenure, Vega disputes his status as a full time member of the band, claiming that he was a member of the band only under contract.<ref name=\"Sergio Vega1\">{{ Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/deftones-sergio-vega-quit-1318765/|title=Why Deftones Bassist Sergio Vega Quit: 'There Was No Opportunity for Growth'|first=Kory|last=Grow|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=February 13, 2024}}</ref><ref name=\"Sergio Vega2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/deftones-part-ways-with-longtime-bassist-sergio-vega/|title=Deftones Part Ways With Longtime Bassist Sergio Vega|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=March 9, 2022|access-date=March 9, 2022|language=en-US}}</ref>}} The band returned with ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' in 2010, and their next three albums, ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' (2012), ''[[Gore (Deftones album)|Gore]]'' (2016) and ''[[Ohms (album)|Ohms]]'' (2020), all received widespread critical acclaim.
