Aznavour was known for his distinctive [[vibrato]] [[tenor]] voice: clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly and profound low notes. In a career as a [[singer and songwriter]], spanning over 70 years, he recorded more than 1,200 songs, in various languages.  Moreover, he wrote or co-wrote more than 1,000 songs for himself and others. Aznavour is regarded as one of the greatest songwriters in history and an icon of 20th-century pop culture.\n\nAznavour sang for presidents, popes and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events. In response to the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]], he founded the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend, impresario [[Lévon Sayan]]. In 2008, he was granted Armenian citizenship and was appointed [[Armenia–Switzerland relations|ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland]] the following year, as well as Armenia's [[permanent delegate]] to the [[United Nations at Geneva]].\n \nOne of France's most popular and enduring singers, he was dubbed France's [[Frank Sinatra]], while music critic [[Stephen Holden]] described Aznavour as a \"French pop deity\". Several media outlets described him as the most famous Armenian of all time. [[Jean Cocteau]], who cast him in his 1960 ''[[Testament of Orpheus|Le Testament d'Orphée]]'', joked \"Before Aznavour despair was unpopular\". Between 1974 and 2016, Aznavour received around sixty gold and platinum records around the world. According to his record company, the total sales of Aznavour's recordings were over 180 million units.\n\nHe started his last world tour in 2014. In 2017, Aznavour was awarded the 2,618th star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Later that year, he and his sister, {{ill|Aida Aznavourian|hy|Աիդա Ազնավուրյան}}, were awarded the [[Raoul Wallenberg Award]] for sheltering [[Jews during World War II]].
