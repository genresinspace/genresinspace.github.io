  "description": "'''Sławomir Skręta''' is the owner of the [[Poland|Polish]] record label [[Blue Star (Polish record label)|Blue Star]], known for releasing domestic dance music known as [[disco polo]]. He, his label and its artists are featured in the Polish documentary on disco polo, Bara Bara, by filmmaker [[Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz]].\n\nThe original name of the genre, muzyka chodnikowa (“sidewalk music”), that referred to cassettes sales from temporary stands on the sidewalks, was changed to the “nobler-sounding” disco polo as a reference to Italo-disco. The changing of the name was an inspiration from Sławomir Skręta, the owner of Blue Star, the first label established to record such music.",
