  "name": "Tamikrest",
  "description": "'''Tamikrest''' is a Malian rock band formed in 2006 in [[Tinzaouaten|Tinzawaten]], a town on the border between [[Algeria]] and [[Mali]], by Ousmane Ag Mossa, Cheikh Ag Tiglia, and Aghaly Ag Mohamedine. Influenced by the musical heritage of [[Tinariwen]] and motivated by the desire to give a stronger voice to the Kel Tamasheq ([[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]) people, the group quickly gained recognition.\n\nTheir first two albums, \"Adagh\" (2010) and \"Toumastin\" (2011), displayed a strong sense of melody and songwriting. The addition of Paul Salvagnac for their third album, \"Chatma,\" contributed to a shift toward a more powerful rock sound. Dedicated to the struggles of women in the [[Sahara]], \"Chatma\" was acclaimed by music critics as a significant work in the Ishumar music genre and won the Songlines Award for Best Album of the Year in 2013.\n\nWith \"Kidal\" (2017) and \"Tamotait\" (2020), Tamikrest further emphasized its deep connection to [[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]] traditions while embracing the energy of rock. The band's music, blending hypnotic trance and melody, is especially impactful in live performances.\n\nThrough numerous tours across Europe, Africa, North and South America, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, Tamikrest has established itself as an important figure in African music and on the international rock stage.",
