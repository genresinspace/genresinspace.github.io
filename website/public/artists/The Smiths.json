  "name": "The Smiths",
  "description": "'''The Smiths''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1982, composed of [[Morrissey]] (vocals), [[Johnny Marr]] (guitar), [[Andy Rourke]] (bass) and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] (drums). Morrissey and Marr formed the band's songwriting partnership. The Smiths are regarded as one of the most important British bands and one of the pioneers of 1980s [[independent music]].\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent label [[Rough Trade Records]] in 1983 and released their debut album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]]'', in 1984. Their focus on a guitar, bass and drum sound, fusing art rock and [[post-punk]], was a rejection of the [[synth-pop]] sound predominant at the time. Several of the band's singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK singles chart]], and all their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985). The band achieved mainstream success in Europe with ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' (1986) and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (1987), which both entered the top 20 of the [[European Albums Chart]]. \n\nIn 1986, the Smiths briefly expanded to a five-piece with the addition of guitarist [[Craig Gannon]], but internal tensions eventually led to their breakup the following year. The split was followed by heavily publicised lawsuits over royalties, and the band members have consistently rejected numerous offers to reunite in the years since. The bassist Andy Rourke died in 2023.",
