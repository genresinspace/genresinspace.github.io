  "name": "The Smiths",
  "description": "'''The Smiths''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1982, composed of [[Morrissey]] (vocals), [[Johnny Marr]] (guitar), [[Andy Rourke]] (bass) and [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] (drums). Morrissey and Marr formed the band's songwriting partnership. The Smiths are regarded as one of the most important acts to emerge from 1980s British [[independent music]].\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent label [[Rough Trade Records]] in 1983 and released their debut album, ''[[The Smiths (album)|The Smiths]]'', in 1984. Their focus on a guitar, bass and drum sound, fusing 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], was a rejection of the [[synth-pop]] sound predominant at the time. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK singles chart]], and all their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985). The band achieved mainstream success in Europe with ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' (1986) and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (1987), which both entered the top 20 of the [[European Albums Chart]]. In 1986, the band briefly became a five-piece with the addition of guitarist [[Craig Gannon]].\n\nInternal tensions led to the Smiths' breakup in 1987, followed by public lawsuits over royalties. Members of the group have rejected numerous offers to reunite. Rourke died in 2023.",
