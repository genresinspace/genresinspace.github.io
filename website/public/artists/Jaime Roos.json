  "description": "Jaime Roos (born 12 November 1953 in Montevideo, Uruguay) is an Uruguayan singer-songwriter, composer, and producer, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Uruguayan music. His work blends traditional local genres—such as [[candombe]], [[murga]], and [[Milonga (music)|milonga]]—with [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Pop music|pop]] elements, creating a distinctive sound often described as a musical expression of [[Montevideo]]’s identity.\n\nRoos began his career in the early 1970s and spent several years living and performing in Europe before returning to Uruguay in the 1980s, where he gained widespread recognition. Albums such as ''Mediocampo'' (1984) and ''Brindis por Pierrot'' (1985) became landmarks in the country’s musical history. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, Roos’s fame also reached [[Argentina]], where he came to be regarded as an influential and important musician.\n\nRoos has also composed music for theater and film in both Uruguay and Argentina, produced albums for other artists, and earned numerous awards in both countries.",
