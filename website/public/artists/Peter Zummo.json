  "description": "'''Peter Zummo''' is an American composer and [[trombonist]]. He has been described as \"an important exponent of the American contemporary classical tradition.\" He has called his own work \"minimalism plus a whole lot more.\"\n\nSince 1967, Zummo's compositions exploring [[rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[new Music (music industry)|new]] music, [[electronic music]], [[disco]], [[punk rock|punk]], and [[world-music|world music]] have been presented in venues including [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], [[New York City Center]], Experimental Intermedia Foundation, [[Roulette Intermedium|Roulette]], The Kitchen, [[Dance Theater Workshop]], and [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], among many others in New York City. He has appeared in additional venues across the country and worldwide, including Café Oto and King's Place in London, KRAAK Festival in Brussels, and Rewire Festival in The Hague.\n\nThe website of the music magazine ''Pitchfork'' called Zummo's music “the sound of sublimity…that sends shivers down the nervous system,” and in an interview with ''The Quietus'', Scottish deejay JD Twitch (Keith McIvor) characterized Zummo's work as “sheer bliss.”",
