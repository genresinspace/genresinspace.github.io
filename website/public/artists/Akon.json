  "description": "'''Aliaune Damala Bouga Time Puru Nacka Lu Lu Lu Badara Akon Thiam''' (born April 16, 1973), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Akon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|k|ɒ|n}}), is a [[Senegalese Americans|Senegalese-American]] singer, songwriter, record producer, businessman and philanthropist. An influential figure in [[world music]], he rose to prominence in 2004 following the release of his single \"[[Locked Up (song)|Locked Up]]\" (featuring [[Styles P]]). Styled in [[hip-hop]], it preceded the release of his debut studio album ''[[Trouble (Akon album)|Trouble]]'' (2004), which became his commercial breakthrough and spawned the [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-styled follow-up, \"[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]\", the following year.\n\nHis second album, ''[[Konvicted]]'' (2006), peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was nominated for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]] at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]], while its lead singles — \"[[I Wanna Love You (Akon song)|I Wanna Love You]]\" (featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]) and \"[[Smack That]]\" (featuring [[Eminem]]) — both received nominations for [[Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]]. The songs simultaneously peaked at numbers one and two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], respectively, along with two of his singles released the following year: \"[[Don't Matter]]\" and his guest performance on [[Gwen Stefani]]'s \"[[The Sweet Escape (song)|The Sweet Escape]]\"; this made Akon the first solo artist to concurrently hold the top two positions on the chart twice. His third album, ''[[Freedom (Akon album)|Freedom]]'' (2008), was supported by the top ten single, \"[[Right Now (Na Na Na)]]\", as well as the top 40 singles \"[[I'm So Paid]]\" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Jeezy]]) and \"[[Beautiful (Akon song)|Beautiful]]\" (featuring [[Colby O'Donis]] and [[Kardinal Offishall]]). His fourth album, ''[[El Negreeto]]'' (2019), explored [[reggaeton]] and [[Latin music]], while his fifth album, ''Akonda'' (also 2019), explored [[Afrobeats]]; both of which failed to chart.\n\nAlong with his solo career, Akon has guest performed on 23 ''Billboard'' Hot 100 entries for other artists—such activity earned him two additional Grammy Award nominations. Akon founded the record labels [[Konvict Muzik]] in 2004 and [[KonLive Distribution]] in 2007, through which he has signed commercially successful acts including [[Lady Gaga]], [[T-Pain]], [[R. City]], [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[Jeffree Star]] and [[French Montana]], among others. In addition, he holds a [[Akon production discography|separate career in production and songwriting]] predominantly for artists on the labels, but also for other artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Leona Lewis]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]], and [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]], among others.\n\nAkon has since been prolific in charitable and philanthropic endeavors. He launched the non-profit [[Akon Lighting Africa]] in 2014 and has begun development on [[Akon City]] in Senegal. ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Akon 80th (Power Rank) in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] in 2010 and 5th in the 40 Most Powerful Celebrities in Africa list, in 2011. ''Billboard'' ranked Akon number 6 on the list of Top Digital Songs Artists of the decade. He was listed by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the number-one selling artist for master ringtones in the world, with 11 million sold by December 2007.",
