  "description": "'''Os Mutantes''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|uz muˈtɐ̃tʃis|lang}}, ''The Mutants'') is a Brazilian rock band that were linked with the [[Tropicalismo|Tropicália]] movement of the late 1960s.  Heavily influenced by Anglo-American [[psychedelic pop]], they bridged Brazilian sensibilities together with studio trickery, [[guitar feedback|feedback]], [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], and [[musique concrète]]. They released their now-acclaimed [[Os Mutantes (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1968.\n\nOs Mutantes formed as a trio in 1966. They backed [[Gilberto Gil]] on his [[Gilberto Gil (1968 album)|1968 self-titled album]] and were featured on the famous ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'' collective album that year. The group quickly became one of the main figures of the \"new MPB\" (popular Brazilian music) and [[Brazilian rock]]. Their 1970s work eventually moved toward [[progressive rock]], with Lee leaving the group in 1972. They broke up in 1978. Throughout these twelve years, nine albums were recorded, although two of them – ''[[O A e o Z]]'' and ''[[Tecnicolor]]'' – were only released in the 1990s. It was during this later decade that Os Mutantes was recognized, by both national and international press, as an important act of the [[psychedelic era]].\n\nAlthough best known for its original line-up of [[Rita Lee]], [[Arnaldo Baptista]] and [[Sérgio Dias]], the band has gone through numerous personnel changes throughout its existence, with Dias being the band's sole consistent member; [[Liminha (musician)|Liminha]] and Dinho Leme also joined the group later on. After a hiatus from the late 1970s to the early 2000s, the band reunited in 2006 without Lee, touring and recording new material.",
