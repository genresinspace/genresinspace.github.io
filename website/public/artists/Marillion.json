  "description": "'''Marillion''' {{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|i|ə|n}} are  a British [[neo-prog]] band, formed in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, in 1979. They emerged from the [[post-punk]] music scene in Britain and existed as a bridge between the styles of [[punk rock]] and classic [[progressive rock]], becoming the most commercially successful neo-prog band of the 1980s.\n\nMarillion released their debut single \"[[Market Square Heroes]]\" in 1982, followed by their first album ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]'' in 1983. They have released 20 studio albums in total. The band achieved eight Top 10 UK albums between 1983 and 1994, including a [[List of UK Albums Chart number ones of the 1980s|No. 1]] album in 1985 with ''[[Misplaced Childhood]]''. The album also produced two UK Top 10 singles in \"[[Kayleigh]]\" (No. 2) and \"[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]\" (No. 5), while the follow-up album, 1987's ''[[Clutching at Straws]]'', included another UK Top 10 single \"[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]\" (No. 6). ''Clutching at Straws'' was the band's last studio album with original lead singer [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], who left for a solo career in late 1988. Altogether, during the Fish era, Marillion scored 11 Top 40 hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. \"Kayleigh\" also entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States.\n\nIn early 1989, Marillion announced [[Steve Hogarth]] as their new lead singer. The first album with him, ''[[Seasons End]]'', was another Top 10 hit, and albums continued to chart well until their departure from [[EMI Records]], following the release of their 1996 live album ''[[Made Again]]'', and the dissipation of the band's mainstream popularity in the late 1990s; save for a resurgence in the mid- to late-2000s, they have essentially been a [[cult following|cult act]] since then. Since the arrival of Hogarth, Marillion have achieved a further 12 Top 40 hit singles in the UK, including 2004's \"[[You're Gone (Marillion song)|You're Gone]]\" from the album ''[[Marbles (album)|Marbles]]'', which charted at No.&nbsp;7 and is the biggest hit of the Hogarth era. In 2016, the album ''[[Fuck Everyone and Run (F E A R)]]'' returned them to the [[UK Albums Chart]] Top 10 for the first time since 1994's ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]''. Their most recent album, 2022's ''[[An Hour Before It's Dark]]'', entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 2, their highest chart position since ''Clutching at Straws'' in 1987. Marillion continue to tour internationally, becoming ranked 38th in [[Classic Rock (magazine)|''Classic Rock'']]'s \"50 Best Live Acts of All Time\" in 2008. \n\nDespite unpopularity in the mainstream media and a consistently unfashionable status within the British music industry, Marillion have maintained a loyal international fanbase, becoming widely acknowledged as playing a pioneering role in the development of [[crowdfunding]] and [[fan-funded music]]. They have sold over 15 million albums worldwide.",
