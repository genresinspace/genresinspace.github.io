  "name": "Creedence Clearwater Revival",
  "description": "'''Creedence Clearwater Revival''', commonly abbreviated as '''CCR''' or simply '''Creedence''', was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[El Cerrito, California]], in 1959. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter [[John Fogerty]], his brother, rhythm guitarist [[Tom Fogerty]], bassist [[Stu Cook]], and drummer [[Doug Clifford]]. These members had played together since 1959, first as the Blue Velvets and later as the Golliwogs, before settling on Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1967. The band's most prolific and successful period between 1969 and 1971 produced 14 consecutive top-10 singles (many of which were [[double A-side]]s) and five consecutive top-10 albums in the United States, two of which—''[[Green River (album)|Green River]]'' (1969) and ''[[Cosmo's Factory]]'' (1970)—topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. The band performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock]] festival in [[upstate New York]], and was the first major act signed to appear there.\n\nCCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom had quit the band the previous year, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates. John's disagreements with [[Fantasy Records]] owner [[Saul Zaentz]] led to more court cases and John refused to perform with the two other surviving members of the band—Tom had died in 1990—at Creedence's 1993 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Though the band has never publicly reunited, John continues to perform CCR songs as part of his solo act, while Cook and Clifford performed as [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]] from 1995 to 2020.\n\nCCR's music remains popular and is a staple of U.S. [[classic rock]] radio airplay; 45 million CCR records have been sold in the U.S. alone. The compilation album ''[[Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits]]'', originally released in 1976, is still on the ''Billboard'' 200 and reached the 600-week mark in August 2022. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|12-times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for at least 12 million copies sold in the U.S.",
