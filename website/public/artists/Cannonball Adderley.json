A cover version by [[the Buckinghams]], who added lyrics, also reached No. 5 on the charts. Adderley worked with [[Miles Davis]], first as a member of the Davis sextet, appearing on the seminal records ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959), and then on his own 1958 album ''[[Somethin' Else (Cannonball Adderley album)|Somethin' Else]]''. He was the elder brother of jazz trumpeter [[Nat Adderley]], who was a longtime member of his band.",
