  "description": "'''Lawrence''' '''Parker''' (born August 20, 1965), known professionally as '''KRS-One''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|eɪ|_|ɑr|_|ɛ|s|_|ˈ|w|ʌ|n}}; an abbreviation of \"Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone\") and '''Teacha''', is an American rapper from [[the Bronx]]. He rose to prominence as part of the hip-hop group [[Boogie Down Productions]], which he formed with DJ [[Scott La Rock]] in the mid-1980s. KRS-One is known for his songs \"[[Sound of da Police]]\", \"Love's Gonna Get'cha (Material Love)\", and \"My Philosophy\". Boogie Down Productions received numerous awards and critical acclaim in their early years. Following the release of the group's debut album, ''[[Criminal Minded]]'', fellow artist Scott La Rock was shot and killed, but KRS-One continued the group, effectively as a solo project. He began releasing records under his own name in 1993. He is politically active, having started the \"Stop the Violence Movement\" after La Rock's death. He is also a [[vegan activist]], expressed in songs such as \"Beef\". He is widely considered an influence on many hip-hop artists.",
