  "description": "'''One Voice Children's Choir''' (originally known as the '''2002 Winter Olympic Children's Choir''' and '''Studio A Children's Choir''') is an American children's [[choir]] in [[Utah]].\n\nThe group was founded by children and [[Masa Fukuda]] in 2001 after he composed the song \"It Just Takes Love\" for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. Fukuda asked students to participate in a commemorative CD for the Olympics. Some of the students also were \"children of light\" performers for the Olympics, whom he volunteered to help train. After the Olympics, 25 students wanted to continue singing together, and Fukuda formed the choir as a [[nonprofit organization]] to continue working with them.\n\nOne Voice Children's Choir is led by choir director Masa Fukuda and Artistic Directors Michelle Boothe and Tanner DeWaal and has 180 members ages 5–18. Every year, the choir performs around 50 to 70 times. The group meets year-round for once-a-week practices. They perform a vast selection of music such as [[pop music|pop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[classical music|classical]], [[Broadway musical|Broadway]], and patriotic.\n\nIn 2003, the choir sang the [[Christmas]] song \"Innocence of Youth\" and won the [[John Lennon]] International Music Award after singing in a competition for [[Yoko Ono]]. In 2014, One Voice received national attention for their rendition of the [[Disney]] song \"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\", starring Lexi Walker and [[Alex Boyé]]. Their video received 1 million views in one day, 18 million in 10 days, and over 60 million by July 2015. They were invited to compete in the [[America's Got Talent (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' (AGT) in 2014 and reached the quarterfinals.",
