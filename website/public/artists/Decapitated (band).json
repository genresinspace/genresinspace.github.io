The band's fourth album, ''[[Organic Hallucinosis]]'' was released in 2006 with vocalist [[Adrian Kowanek|Adrian \"Covan\" Kowanek]], who had replaced Wąsowicz the year before.\n\nIn late 2007, the band was involved in an automobile accident. Vitek died at the age of 23 on November 2, 2007, from the injuries he suffered from the accident; Covan survived, but he slipped into a coma as a result. After a period of disbandment, Vogg reformed Decapitated in 2009 and the band has released four more studio albums since then: ''[[Carnival Is Forever]]'' (2011), ''[[Blood Mantra]]'' (2014), ''[[Anticult (album)|Anticult]]'' (2017) and ''[[Cancer Culture]]'' (2022).
