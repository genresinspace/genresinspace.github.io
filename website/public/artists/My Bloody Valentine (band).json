  "name": "My Bloody Valentine",
  "description": "'''My Bloody Valentine''' are an Irish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Dublin]] in 1983 and consisting of founding members [[Kevin Shields]] (vocals, guitar, [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]) and [[Colm Ó Cíosóig]] (drums, sampler), with [[Bilinda Butcher]] (vocals, guitar) and [[Debbie Googe]] (bass).  Their work is characterized by distorted guitar textures, subdued [[androgynous]] vocals, and unorthodox [[music production|production]] techniques. They are widely cited as a pioneering act in the [[shoegaze]] genre.\n\nFollowing several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to [[Creation Records]] in 1988. The band released several successful [[Extended play|EP]]s and the albums ''[[Isn't Anything]]'' (1988) and ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]'' (1991) on the label; the latter is often described as their [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]. However, My Bloody Valentine were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to [[Island Records]] and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive.\n\nGooge and Ó Cíosóig left the band in 1995; they were followed by Butcher in 1997. Unable to complete a follow-up to ''Loveless'', Shields isolated himself and, in his own words, \"went crazy\". In 2007, My Bloody Valentine reunited and subsequently embarked on a world tour. They released the compilation ''[[EP's 1988–1991]]'' in 2012. Their long-delayed third studio album, {{nowrap|''[[m b v]]''}}, was released in 2013 to critical acclaim and was supported by further touring.",
