  "name": "My Bloody Valentine",
  "description": "'''My Bloody Valentine''' (often abbreviated as '''MBV''') are an Irish-English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Dublin in 1983. The lineup of the band comprises [[Kevin Shields]] (vocals, guitar), [[Colm Ó Cíosóig]] (drums), [[Debbie Googe]] (bass) and [[Bilinda Butcher]] (vocals, guitar). They are widely regarded as pioneers of the [[shoegaze]] genre. Their work is characterised by distorted guitar textures, subdued [[androgynous]] vocals, and unorthodox [[music production|production]] techniques.\n\nFollowing several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to [[Creation Records]] in 1988. The band released several successful [[extended play]]s (EPs) on the label, and the albums ''[[Isn't Anything]]'' (1988) and ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]'' (1991). The latter is often deemed their [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], though My Bloody Valentine were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to [[Island Records]] and recorded several albums' worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive.\n\nGooge and Ó Cíosóig left My Bloody Valentine in 1995, and were followed by Butcher in 1997; Shields left the band that same year after he, in his own words, \"went crazy\". They reunited in 2007 for a world tour and released the compilation album ''[[EP's 1988–1991]]'' in 2012. Their third studio album, {{nowrap|''[[m b v]]''}} (2013), received critical acclaim and was supported by further touring.",
