It consisted of vocalist-guitarist [[David Byrne]], drummer [[Chris Frantz]], bassist [[Tina Weymouth]], and guitarist-keyboardist [[Jerry Harrison]]. Described as \"one of the most critically acclaimed groups of the '80s,\" Talking Heads helped to pioneer [[New wave music|new wave]] music by combining elements of [[punk rock|punk]], [[art rock]], [[funk]], and [[world music]] with \"an anxious yet clean-cut image\".\n\nByrne, Frantz, and Weymouth met as freshmen at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], where Byrne and Frantz were part of a band called the Artistics.{{r|Gans_198512|page=[https://archive.org/details/talkingheads0000gans/page/24/ 24]}} The trio moved to New York City in 1975, adopted the name Talking Heads, joined the [[Music of New York City|New York punk scene]], and recruited Harrison to round out the band; this lineup remained the same for the rest of Talking Heads' career. Signing to [[Sire Records]] in 1976, the band's debut album, ''[[Talking Heads: 77]]'', was released in the following year to positive reviews. They collaborated with the British producer [[Brian Eno]] on the acclaimed albums ''[[More Songs About Buildings and Food]]'' (1978), ''[[Fear of Music]]'' (1979), and ''[[Remain in Light]]'' (1980), which blended their [[art school]] sensibilities with influence from artists such as [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and [[Fela Kuti]]. From the early 1980s, they included additional musicians in their recording sessions and shows, including guitarist [[Adrian Belew]], keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], singer [[Nona Hendryx]], and bassist [[Busta Jones]].\n\nTalking Heads reached their commercial peak in 1983 with the [[Pop 100|U.S. Top 10]] hit \"[[Burning Down the House]]\" from the album ''[[Speaking in Tongues (Talking Heads album)|Speaking in Tongues]]''. In 1984, they released the concert film ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'', which was directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]. For these performances, they were joined by Worrell, guitarist [[Alex Weir (musician)|Alex Weir]], percussionist Steve Scales, and singers [[Lynn Mabry]] and Ednah Holt.

Without Byrne, the other band members performed under the name '''Shrunken Heads''', and released an album, ''[[No Talking, Just Head]]'', as '''the Heads''' in 1996, featuring various singers in place of Byrne.\n\nIn 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].
