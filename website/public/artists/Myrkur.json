  "name": "Myrkur",
  "description": "'''Myrkur''' is a musical project led by Danish singer [[Amalie Bruun]] which combines [[folk rock]] and [[black metal]]. Initially, the real-life identity of the person behind the project was not disclosed but Bruun’s name has since been revealed. Myrkur has released four full-length studio albums to significant critical acclaim, as well as a live album and two [[Extended play|EP]]. Her most recent album,'' Spine'', was released on 20 October 2023 through [[Relapse Records]].\n\nThe name of the project comes from an [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]) word meaning \"darkness.\" The musical influences of Myrkur range from traditional Scandinavian folk to the black metal genre. New releases from Myrkur have tended towards embracing folk music traditions, with Bruun's 2020 album ''[[Folkesange]]'' being overwhelming folk-inspired and lacking the black metal sound that characterized the artist's earlier releases. ''[[Folkesange]]'' contains narrative \"story-songs\" performed on instruments appropriate to the ancient pagan folk music that Bruun included within the album, alongside modern original compositions as well.",
