  "description": "'''Jodeci''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|d|ə|s|i}} {{respell|JOH|də|see}}) is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[quartet]] consisting of members [[DeVanté Swing]], [[Dalvin DeGrate|Mr. Dalvin]], [[K-Ci]], and [[K-Ci & JoJo|JoJo]].  Formed in 1988 in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Jodeci began as a duo of DeVanté Swing and JoJo but later each added their brothers.  After signing with [[Uptown Records]] in 1990, the group finished work on their debut album, ''[[Forever My Lady]]'' (1991), which brought them mainstream success with three straight [[R&B/Hip-Hop songs|''Billboard'' R&B]] No. 1 hit singles: [[Forever My Lady (song)|the album's titular track]], \"[[Stay (Jodeci song)|Stay]]\" and \"[[Come and Talk to Me]]\".\n\nThe group's critical and commercial success continued with the releases of ''[[Diary of a Mad Band]]'' (1993), which includes the ''Billboard'' hit singles \"[[Cry for You (Jodeci song)|Cry for You]]\" and \"[[Feenin']]\", and ''[[The Show, the After Party, the Hotel]]'' (1995), which includes the additional ''Billboard'' hit singles \"[[Freek'n You]]\", \"[[Love U 4 Life]]\", and \"[[Get On Up (Jodeci song)|Get On Up]]\". The group experimented with various musical styles typically not associated with traditional R&B. Jodeci would incorporate [[hip hop soul]], [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[new jack swing]] into their music, which led to the group featured prominently with [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists during the 1990s. Each album released by the group during this period attained [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and helped to redefine the genre, allowing for developments in thematic and musical content within R&B.\n\nIn 1996, they announced a hiatus – though continuing to work on music as a group – which prompted [[K-Ci & JoJo]] to branch off as a duo, releasing five albums until 2013, when the group re-united for their fourth studio album, ''[[The Past, the Present, the Future (Jodeci album)|The Past, the Present, the Future]]'' (2015). Jodeci has sold more than 20 million records worldwide to date. ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' magazine ranks the group 1st on their \"1990s Male R&B Group Pyramid of Excellence\" list in 2014, one of the most influential groups of the 1990s, and the best R&B group of all time.",
