  "description": "'''Richard Christopher Wakeman''' (born 18 May 1949) is an English keyboardist and composer best known as a member of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] across five tenures between 1971 and 2004, and for his prolific solo career. [[AllMusic]] describes Wakeman as a \"classically trained keyboardist extraordinaire who plied his trade with Yes and developed his own brand of live spectacular in a solo act.\"\n\nBorn and raised in [[West London (sub region)|West London]], Wakeman quit his studies at the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1969 to become a full-time [[session musician]]. His early sessions included \"[[Space Oddity]]\", among other tracks, for [[David Bowie]], and songs by [[Elton John]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Cat Stevens]], and [[Lou Reed]]. In 1970, Wakeman joined the folk rock group [[Strawbs|the Strawbs]], during which his virtuosity gained national press coverage. He left in 1971 to join Yes, with whom he played on some of their most influential albums across two stints until 1980. During this time Wakeman began a solo career in 1973 and became an iconic and prominent figure in progressive rock. His highest-selling and most acclaimed albums were ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (album)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1973), the UK number-one ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'' (1974), and ''[[The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table]]'' (1975), all [[concept albums]]. In 1974, he formed his band the English Rock Ensemble, with which he toured worldwide and continues to perform, and went on to score his first major film, ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975).\n\nWakeman had uneven success in the next two decades following a change in musical fashion and financial issues from two divorces. His most popular album was the conceptual rocker [[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|''1984'']] (1981), which was followed by the minor pop hit single \"Glory Boys\" from ''[[Silent Nights]]'' (1985). He expanded into other areas such as hosting the television show ''[[GasTank]]'', composing for television and film, forming record labels, and producing his first [[New-age music|new-age]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[Christian music]] with ''[[Country Airs]]'' (1986) and ''The Gospels'' (1987), respectively. In 1988, he reunited with former Yes bandmates for [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]], which led to his third period in the group until 1992. Wakeman's most significant album of the 1990s was ''[[Return to the Centre of the Earth]]'' (1999), his first UK top 40 album in 18 years, and his piano album ''[[Piano Portraits]]'' (2017) produced his first UK top 10 album since 1975. Starting in 2009, Wakeman revisited his three hit albums of the 1970s by performing them live with new and expanded arrangements. From 2016 to 2020, Wakeman was a member of [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman]]. He continues to record albums and perform concerts worldwide in various capacities. His most recent album was ''Melancholia'', released in October 2025.\n\nWakeman's [[Rick Wakeman discography|discography]] includes over 100 solo albums{{efn|Wakeman's 2017 album ''Piano Portraits'' was marketed as his 100th solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/album-reviews/new-releases-vienna-new-year/|title=New Releases: Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Concert 2017 and 100th solo album from Rick Wakeman|date=9 January 2017|publisher=Classic FM|access-date=5 September 2024}}</ref> The 2018 tour programme for his following album, ''Piano Odyssey'', lists 108 albums.<ref name=Odyssey2018/> }} spanning a range of musical styles.
