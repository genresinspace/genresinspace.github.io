  "description": "'''Janette Anne Dimech''' (born 10 October 1951), known professionally as '''Jeanette''', is an English-born Spanish singer and songwriter. She first rose to prominence as the lead singer of [[Pic-Nic]], a teenage [[folk-pop]] band that found success in 1968 with her song \"Cállate, niña\". Jeanette returned as a solo artist in 1971 with the [[Hispavox]] [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Soy rebelde]]\", which redefined her career as a [[Latin ballad|romantic balladist]] and was a hit across the Spanish-speaking world, becoming a generational anthem.\n\nIn 1976, [[Carlos Saura]] included Jeanette's 1974 song \"[[Porque te vas]]\" in his film ''[[Cría cuervos]]'', which propelled it to become a major hit and one of the most famous Spanish pop songs of all time and origined many versions of it in other languages, the most famous one being Russian \"[[В Последний Раз]] (For The Last Time)\". After the international success of \"Porque te vas\", Jeanette worked in France and Germany until she returned to the Spanish market with the 1981 album ''[[Corazón de poeta]]'', which includes several of her most famous songs. The commercial reception of ''Corazón de poeta'' allowed her to record two more albums with [[RCA Victor]]—''Reluz'' in 1983 and ''Ojos en el sol'' in 1984—which were unsuccessful. Her last studio album, ''Loca por la música'', was released in 1989 on [[independent record label]] Twins and sought to reinvent her style with [[techno-pop]] influences.\n\nThe figure of Jeanette has been revalued in the 21st century and she is now considered a [[cult status|cult]] artist and an influence on Spanish-language [[indie pop]]. In 2010, ''[[20 minutos]]'' described Jeanette as \"a legend of [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] and muse of [[Indie pop|independent pop]]\".",
