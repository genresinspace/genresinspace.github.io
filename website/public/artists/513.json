  "description": "'''Ruins''' is a Japanese music duo composed only of drummer/vocalist [[Tatsuya Yoshida]] and a [[bass guitar]]ist (there have been four such bassists in the band's history). The group, formed in 1985, was supposedly intended to be a [[power trio]]; the guitarist, however, never showed up to the band's first rehearsal so the group remained a duo. The music touches on [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]] and [[noise rock]].",
