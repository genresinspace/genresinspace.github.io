  "name": "Anita Mui",
  "description": "'''Anita Mui Yim-fong''' ({{lang-zh|t=梅艷芳}}; 10 October 1963 – 30 December 2003) was a Hong Kong singer and actress who made major contributions to the [[Cantopop]] music scene and received numerous awards and honours. She remained an idol throughout her career, and is regarded as \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|Queen of Cantopop]]\". She was dubbed as the \"daughter of Hong Kong\" and is considered one of the most iconic Cantopop singers.\n\nMui once held a sold-out concert in [[Hammersmith]], [[London]], England, where she was dubbed the \"[[Madonna]] of Asia\", which brought her to further international fame. That title stayed with her throughout her career, in both Eastern and Western media.\n\nIn the 1980s, the [[gangtai]] style of music was revolutionised by Mui's wild dancing and on-stage femininity. She was famed for her outrageous costumes and high-powered performances in tandem with [[contralto]] vocals, which are rare in female artists. Her 1985 album, ''Bad Girl'', sold over 400,000 copies in Hong Kong and remains the [[List of best-selling albums by country#Hong Kong|highest-selling album of all time]] in the territory.\n\nHer fan base reached far beyond Hong Kong into many parts of Asia, including [[Taiwan]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], Korea, [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]]. In the Hong Kong entertainment industry, where stars often rise and fall quickly, Mui consistently remained in the spotlight for 21 years (1982–2003). Her career came to an abrupt end in 2003 when she announced she had [[cervical cancer]]. She died later that year at the age of 40; her sister, [[Ann Mui]], died three years earlier, at the same age from the same disease.",
