Early in his career, he also played [[tenor saxophone]] and [[clarinet]] (including [[bass clarinet]]), but Mann was among the first jazz musicians to specialize on the flute. His most popular single was \"[[Hi-Jack]]\", which was a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Number-one dance hits of 1975 (USA)|No. 1 dance hit]] for three weeks in 1975.\n\nMann emphasized the [[Groove (music)|groove]] approach in his music. Mann felt that from his repertoire, the \"epitome of a groove record\" was ''[[Memphis Underground]]'' or ''[[Push Push (Herbie Mann album)|Push Push]]'', because the \"rhythm section locked all in one perception.\"",
