  "name": "Wham!",
  "description": "'''Wham!''' were  an English [[Pop music|pop]] duo formed in [[Bushey]] in 1981 consisting of [[George Michael]] and [[Andrew Ridgeley]]. They were one of the most successful pop acts during the 1980s, selling more than 30 million certified records worldwide from 1982 to 1986. Associated with the MTV-driven [[Second British Invasion]] of the US, the singles \"[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]\", \"[[Careless Whisper]]\", and \"[[Everything She Wants]]\" all topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Their 1984 Christmas hit \"[[Last Christmas]]\" has become a staple of the holiday season since its release, with all proceeds from the single going to charity. \n\nInfluenced by [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] music and presenting themselves as disaffected youth, Wham!'s 1983 debut album ''[[Fantastic (Wham! album)|Fantastic]]'' addressed the United Kingdom's unemployment problem and teen angst over adulthood. Their second studio album ''[[Make It Big]]'' in 1984 was a worldwide pop smash hit, charting at number one in both the UK and the United States. In 1985, Wham! made a highly publicised ten-day visit to China, the first by a Western pop group. The event was seen as a major watershed moment in increasing friendly bilateral relations between China and the West.\n\nIn 1986, Wham! disbanded. Michael was keen to create music targeted at a more sophisticated adult market rather than the duo's primarily teenage audience. Before going their separate ways, they released a farewell single, \"[[The Edge of Heaven]]\", and a greatest-hits album titled ''[[The Final (album)|The Final]]'', along with a farewell concert entitled [[The Final (concert)|the Final]].",
