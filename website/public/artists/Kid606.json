  "description": "'''Miguel Trost De Pedro''' (born July 27, 1979), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Kid606''', is an [[electronic music]]ian who was raised in [[San Diego]] and later moved to [[San Francisco]]. He is most closely associated with the [[Glitch (music)|glitch]], [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], [[hardcore techno]] and [[breakcore]] scenes.\n\nKid606's music is similar to the work of his friend and colleague [[J Lesser|Lesser]], as well as hardcore and IDM acts such as [[Atari Teenage Riot]], [[Autechre]], [[Mr. Oizo]], and [[Matmos]]. He is primarily inspired not by his electronic contemporaries, but by his love of the [[industrial music]], [[death metal]], and [[industrial metal]] of the 1980s and 1990s, particularly bands like [[Godflesh]] and [[Napalm Death]]. His music is known for its high tempo [[breakbeat]]s and liberal use of [[Noise music|noise]] and [[sampling (music)|sampling]], as well as its punk aesthetic, uninhibited genre-mixing, and irreverent sense of humor. However, he is equally adept at creating more serious tracks that often reside in the realm of [[ambient music|ambient]] and glitch (\"Parenthood\" from ''[[Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You]]'' and the entirety of ''[[PS I Love You (album)|P.S. I Love You]]'' being good examples).\n\nNotable releases by Kid606 include ''[[Don't Sweat the Technics]]'' (VC140: 1998), ''[[Down with the Scene]]'' (IPC-7:2000), ''P.S. I Love You'' (MP93: 2000), and ''Kill Sound Before Sound Kills You'' (IPC-46: 2003). He collaborated or participated in the groups Flossin, Spacewurm, Ariel and [[Disc (band)|Disc]].\n \nIn 2005, he put together a band with a drummer and guitarist called Kid606 and Friends.",
