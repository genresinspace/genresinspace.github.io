  "description": "'''Art Brut''' is an English [[indie rock]] band. Their debut album, ''[[Bang Bang Rock & Roll]]'', was released on 30 May 2005, with its follow up, ''[[It's a Bit Complicated]]'', released on 25 June 2007. Named after French painter [[Jean Dubuffet]]'s definition of [[outsider art]] – art by prisoners, loners, the mentally ill, and other marginalized people, and made without thought to imitation or presentation – South London's Art Brut were tagged by ''[[NME]]'' as part of the \"Art Wave\" scene that also included bands such as [[The Rakes]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Bloc Party]]. The band released further albums, ''[[Art Brut vs Satan]]'' in 2009 and ''[[Brilliant! Tragic!]]'' in 2011.  A fifth album, ''[[Wham! Bang! Pow! Let's Rock Out!]]\"'', was released in 2018.\n\nThe band's sound is characterised by their straightforward guitar rock setup, as well as frontman [[Eddie Argos]]' enthusiastic ''[[sprechgesang]]''-style vocal delivery, and his humorous, often self-reflexive lyrics about music, relationships and other personal interests.",
