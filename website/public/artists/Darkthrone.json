Their first three black metal albums, ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]'' (1992), ''[[Under a Funeral Moon]]'' (1993), and ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' (1994), are frequently referred to as the \"Unholy Trinity\". These albums are regarded as the epitome of the band's career and among the most influential black metal releases.\n\nDarkthrone has been a duo consisting of [[Fenriz]] and [[Nocturno Culto]] since guitarist [[Ivar Enger|Zephyrous]] departed the band in 1993. While they have aimed to remain outside the mainstream music scene, in recent years they collaborated with the [[National Library of Norway]] for exhibitions focused on Norwegian cultural history and black metal. Since 2006, Darkthrone's music has diverged from traditional black metal, incorporating classic [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Punk music|punk]], and [[speed metal]], while their more recent albums have also incorporated elements of [[doom metal]].",
