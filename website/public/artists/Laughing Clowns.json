  "description": "'''Laughing Clowns''', sometimes written as '''The Laughing Clowns''', were a [[post-punk]] band formed in Sydney in 1979. In five years, the band released three LPs, three EPs, and various singles and compilations. Laughing Clowns' sound is [[free jazz]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[krautrock]] influenced. The band formed to accommodate [[Ed Kuepper]]'s growing interest in expanding brass-driven  elements he had brought to The Saints' third album, ''[[Prehistoric Sounds]]'', and by adopting flattened fifth notes in a rock and roll setting while using a modern jazz styled band line-up.\n\nAlong with [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], [[The Go-Betweens]], [[The Moodists]] and [[The Triffids]], the Laughing Clowns also spent extended periods in Europe during the early 1980s, and gained an international cult status. All four aforementioned groups have cited Laughing Clowns as an influence at some point in their respective careers.",
