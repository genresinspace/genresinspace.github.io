  "description": "'''Cheap Trick''' is an American rock band formed in [[Rockford, Illinois]] in 1970 by guitarist [[Rick Nielsen]], bassist [[Tom Petersson]], lead vocalist [[Robin Zander]] and drummer [[Bun E. Carlos]]. Their work bridged elements of '60s [[pop rock|guitar pop]], '70s [[hard rock]], and the emerging [[punk rock]] sound, and would help set the template for subsequent [[power pop]] artists.\n\nCheap Trick released their [[Cheap Trick (1977 album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1977 and, later that year, found success in Japan with the release of their second album, ''[[In Color (album)|In Color]]''. 1978's ''[[Heaven Tonight]]'' included the power pop classic \"[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]\". The band achieved mainstream popularity in the United States in 1979 with the [[RIAA certification|triple-platinum]] live album ''[[Cheap Trick at Budokan|At Budokan]]'' and a Top 10 single, a live recording of \"[[I Want You to Want Me]]\". They followed with ''[[Dream Police]]'' (1979), their most commercially successful studio album, reaching No. 6 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After struggling with declining popularity and lineup changes in the 1980s, Cheap Trick experienced a major resurgence toward the end of the decade when they topped the US charts with the [[power ballad]] \"[[The Flame (Cheap Trick song)|The Flame]]\".\n\nThe band has continued releasing new music into the 21st century and maintains a constant touring schedule, having performed live more than 5,000 times since their formation.
