  "description": "'''No Doubt''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Anaheim, California]] in 1986. For most of its career, the band has consisted of vocalist and founding member [[Gwen Stefani]], guitarist [[Tom Dumont]], bassist [[Tony Kanal]] and drummer [[Adrian Young]]. Keyboardist [[Eric Stefani]], Gwen's brother, was also a member when the band started to release albums in 1992. Since the mid-1990s, trombonist [[Gabrial McNair]] and trumpeter Stephen Bradley have performed with the band as session and touring musicians.\n\nThough its [[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|1992 eponymous debut album]] failed to make an impact, its [[ska punk]]-inspired follow-up ''[[The Beacon Street Collection]]'' sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, more than triple the sales of its predecessor. The band's third album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]''  was released later the same year and benefited from the 1990s resurgence of [[third-wave ska]], going on to achieve [[RIAA certification|diamond certification]]. \"[[Don't Speak]]\", the third single from the album, set a record when it spent 16 weeks at the number one spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart, while \"[[Just a Girl]]\", co-written by Stefani, was described as \"the most popular cut on the CD\".\n\nThe band's next album, ''[[Return of Saturn]]'' (2000), did not match the success of their previous album, despite its Top 40 hit single \"[[Simple Kind of Life]]\". However, the album received critical praise and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[2001 Grammy Awards|43rd Grammy Awards]]. The following year, the band returned with the album ''[[Rock Steady (album)|Rock Steady]]'' (2001), which incorporated [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] music. The album was primarily recorded in [[Jamaica]] and featured collaborations with Jamaican artists [[Bounty Killer]], [[Sly and Robbie]] and [[Lady Saw]]. The album produced two [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning singles, \"[[Hey Baby (No Doubt song)|Hey Baby]]\" and \"[[Underneath It All]]\"; \"[[Hella Good]]\" was also nominated for a Grammy award.\n\nAfter a 2004 tour, the band members pursued solo projects, with Stefani releasing two successful solo albums ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006), while Tom Dumont released his own solo music project, [[Invincible Overlord]]. In 2008, the band resumed working slowly on their sixth and latest effort, titled ''[[Push and Shove (album)|Push and Shove]]'' (2012), and released its lead single \"[[Settle Down (No Doubt song)|Settle Down]]\". The band has sold over 33 million records worldwide.",
