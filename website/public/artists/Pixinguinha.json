  "description": "'''Alfredo da Rocha Viana Filho''' (May 4, 1897 – February 17, 1973), better known as '''Pixinguinha''', ({{IPA|pt|piʃĩˈɡiɲɐ|lang}}) was a Brazilian composer, arranger, flutist, and saxophonist born in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He worked with [[Música popular brasileira|Brazilian popular music]] and developed the ''[[choro]]'', a genre of Brazilian music that blends [[Afro-Brazilian music|Afro-Brazilian]] rhythms with [[European music|European influences]]. Some of his compositions include \"Carinhoso\", \"Glória\", \"Lamento\", and \"Um a Zero\".\n\nPixinguinha merged the traditional music of 19th-century composers with modern [[jazz]]-inspired harmonies, sophisticated arrangements, and Afro-Brazilian rhythms. This is attributed as having helped establish ''choro'' as an aspect of Brazilian culture.\n\nPixinguinha was among the first Brazilian musicians to embrace radio broadcasting and studio recording, technologies that played a key role in bringing his music to a broader audience.",
