  "description": "'''Eluveitie''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|l|ˈ|v|eɪ|t|i}} {{respell|el|VAY|tee}}; {{IPA|de|ɛlˈfaɪ̯tiː|lang}}) is a Swiss [[folk metal]] band from [[Winterthur]], [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]], founded in 2002 by [[Chrigel Glanzmann]]. The project's first demo, ''Vên'', was released in 2003. ''Vên'' was a studio project of Glanzmann's, but its success led to the recruitment of a full band, and the re-release of ''[[Vên]]'' as an [[extended play|EP]] in 2004. The band then released a full-length album, ''[[Spirit (Eluveitie album)|Spirit]]'', in June 2006. In November 2007, Eluveitie was signed by [[Nuclear Blast]]. The group rose to fame following the release of their first major-label album, ''[[Slania]]'', in February 2008. The album peaked at number 35 in the Swiss charts and number 72 in the German charts.\n\nThe band's style incorporates characteristics of [[melodic death metal]] combined with the melodies of traditional [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] music. They use traditional European instruments, including the [[hurdy-gurdy]] and [[bagpipes]], amidst guitars and both clean and harsh vocals. Their lyrics include references to [[Celtic mythology]], particularly of [[Gallia Celtica|Celtic Gaul]]. The lyrics are often in a [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed form]] of the extinct ancient language [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]. The name of the band comes from graffiti on a vessel from [[Mantua]] ({{c.}} 300 BC). The [[Epigraphy|inscription]] in [[Old Italic alphabet#Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan letters]] reads ''eluveitie,'' which has been interpreted as the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] form of the Celtic ''*(h)elvetios'' (“the Helvetian”), presumably referring to a man of [[Helvetii|Helvetian]] descent living in Mantua.",
