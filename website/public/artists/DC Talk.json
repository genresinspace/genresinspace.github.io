They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s and 2010s, and in 2017, and in 2019 the band reunited for a cruise.\n\nThe group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, ''DC Talk'' and ''Nu Thang'', were predominantly [[hip hop music|hip hop]].
