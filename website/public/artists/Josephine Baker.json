  "description": "'''Freda Josephine Baker''' ({{née|'''McDonald'''}}; June 3, 1906 – April 12, 1975), naturalized as '''Joséphine Baker''', was an American-born French dancer, singer, and actress. Her career was centered primarily in Europe, mostly in France. She was the first Black woman to star in a major motion picture, the 1927 French silent film ''[[Siren of the Tropics]]'', directed by {{lang|fr|Mario Nalpas|italic=no}} and {{lang|fr|[[Henri Étiévant]]|italic=no}}.\n\nDuring her early career, Baker was among the most celebrated performers to headline the revues of the {{lang|fr|[[Folies Bergère]]|italic=no}} in [[Paris]]. Her performance in its 1927 [[revue]] {{lang|fr|Un vent de folie}} caused a sensation in the city. Her costume, consisting only of a short skirt of artificial bananas and a beaded necklace, became an iconic image and a symbol both of the [[Jazz Age]] and the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Baker was celebrated by artists and intellectuals of the era, who variously dubbed her the \"Black Venus\", the \"Black Pearl\", the \"Bronze Venus\", and the \"Creole Goddess\". Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], she renounced her U.S. citizenship and became a [[French nationality law#Dual citizenship|French national]] after her marriage to French industrialist Jean Lion in 1937. She adopted 12 children which she referred to as Rainbow Tribe and raised them in France.\n\nBaker aided the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], and also worked with the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and the [[US Secret Service]], the extent of which didn't get publicized until 2020 when French documents were unclassified. After the war, she was awarded the [[Resistance Medal]] by the [[French Committee of National Liberation]], the {{lang|fr|[[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]]|italic=no}} by the [[French military]], and was named a [[Chevalier of the Legion of Honour]] by General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Baker sang: \"I have two loves: my country and Paris.\" She refused to perform for [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] audiences in the United States, and is also noted for her contributions to the [[civil rights movement]]. In 1968, she was offered unofficial leadership in the movement following [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|the assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King]], but declined due to concerns for the welfare of her children. On November 30, 2021, Baker was inducted into the [[Panthéon]] in Paris, the first black woman to receive one of the highest honors in France. As her resting place remains in [[Monaco Cemetery]], a [[cenotaph]] was installed in vault 13 of the crypt in the Panthéon.",
