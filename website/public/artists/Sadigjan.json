  "description": "'''Mirza Sadig''', more commonly known as '''Sadigjan''' ({{langx|az|Sadıqcan}}; 1846 – 1902), was an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] folk musician, tar player, and the creator of the [[Tar (Azerbaijani instrument)|Azerbaijani tar]] (also known as upgraded tar).\n\nSadigjan is one of the famous [[Azerbaijani tar]] players. By improving this instrument, Sadigjan expanded the possibilities of virtuoso playing on this instrument. He increased the number of strings from 5 to 13, made additional changes to the body of the instrument, and completely changed the system of frets on the tar's neck reducing their number from 27–28 to 22.\n\nSadigjan introduced significant innovations in the Azerbaijani [[mugham]] improving the \"[[Segah]]\", \"Mirza Huseyn Segah\" and the \"Mahur\" mughams. The appearance in [[Music of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani music]] of \"Mahur-Hindi\", \"Orta Mahur\", \"Zabul Segah\", \"Kharij Segah\", \"Yetim Segah\", \"Choban Bayati\" mughams is associated with the work of Sadigjan and the Azerbaijani tar.\n\nIn the 1890s, under the leadership of Sadigjan, an ensemble was created in [[Shusha]]. This included famous singers and musicians of that time. Among the students of tar were such famous musicians as [[Gurban Pirimov|Gurban Primov]], [[Mashadi Zeynal]], Arsen Yaramishev, Mardi Janibekov, [[Malibeyli Hamid]], [[Mashadi Jamil Amirov]], Shirin Akhundov and others.",
