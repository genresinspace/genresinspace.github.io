Records, Cold Crush, [[Kill Rock Stars]], Cochon Records, and [[Retard Disco]]. The band had four members (represented by the four exclamation marks in the band name), that went by the [[pseudonyms]] Chunx, Funx, [[Seth Bogart|Hunx]], and Junx. Chunx and Funx formed the band in 2001 as a vehicle for recording humiliating songs about an ex-lover. It was for this purpose that their first single, \"Hella Nervous\", was recorded. Shortly after, the two-piece recruited two openly gay backup dancers, Hunx and Drunx. Drunx was later replaced by Junx.\n\nGravy Train!!!! toured with [[Bratmobile]] and [[Le Tigre]].",
