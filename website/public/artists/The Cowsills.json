  "description": "'''The Cowsills''' are an American singing group from [[Newport, Rhode Island]], six siblings noted for performing professionally and singing harmonies at an early age, later with their mother.\n\nThe band was formed in early 1965 by brothers [[Bill Cowsill|Bill]], Bob, and [[Barry Cowsill|Barry]] Cowsill; their brother [[John Cowsill|John]] joined shortly thereafter. Originally Bill and Bob played guitar and Barry played the drums. When John learned to play drums and joined the band, Barry began playing bass. After their initial success, the brothers were joined by their siblings [[Susan Cowsill|Susan]] and Paul along with their mother, Barbara. A seventh sibling, Bob's fraternal twin brother Richard, was never part of the band during its heyday, although he occasionally appeared with them in later years.\n\nThe band's road manager for most of their career was Richard \"Biggie\" Korn. When the group expanded to its full family membership by 1967, the six siblings ranged in age from 8 to 19.  Joined by their mother, Barbara Cowsill (n√©e Russell), the group inspired the 1970s television show ''[[The Partridge Family]]''.",
