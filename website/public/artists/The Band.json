In the mid-1960s, they gained recognition for backing [[Bob Dylan]] on his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 concert tour]] as Dylan's first electric band. After leaving Dylan and changing their name to The Band, they released their 1968 debut album, ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'', and its succeeding album, 1969's ''[[The Band (album)|The Band]]'', to critical acclaim and commercial success. [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Roger Waters]] deemed it the \"second-most influential record in the history of rock and roll\", and music journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] called it \"country soul ... a sound never heard before\". The Band's most popular songs include \"[[The Weight]]\" (1968), \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\" (1969), and \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\" (1969). The Band later released ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' (1970), ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'' (1971), the live album ''[[Rock of Ages (The Band album)|Rock of Ages]]'' (1972), the [[covers album]] ''[[Moondog Matinee]]'' (1973), and ''[[Northern Lights â€“ Southern Cross]]'' (1975).\n\nThe Band performed a farewell concert on November 25, 1976. Footage from the event was released in 1978 as the [[concert film]] ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].  After five years apart, Danko, Hudson, Helm, and Manuel reunited in 1983 for a tour without Robertson. Manuel died in 1986, but the remaining three members continued to tour and occasionally released new albums of studio material until Danko's death in 1999, after which the Band broke up for good. The Band was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them 50th on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]].
