  "name": "Banana Boat",
  "description": "'''Banana Boat''' is a Polish [[a cappella]] [[sextet]], authoring and performing original songs representing the genre of neo-shanties. Being one of the pioneers of the new genre, the group retains its simultaneous focus on contemporary interpretations of traditional [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]] and maritime music. Owing to its characteristic six-part, jazzy harmony, departing from the traditional sound of the music of the sea, the group has become one of the emblems of what the international artists of the maritime stage have informally come to dub as the ''Polish style'' maritime song. With maritime music constantly in the focus of its activity, since 2004, Banana Boat has also been experimenting with other musical genres, including popular and jazz compositions, inviting other artists to participate in individual projects. The group is a member of the International Seasong and Shanty Association (ISSA).",
