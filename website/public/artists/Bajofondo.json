  "name": "Bajofondo",
  "description": "'''Bajofondo''' is a [[Río de la Plata]]-based music band consisting of eight musicians from [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], which aims to create a more contemporary version of [[tango]] and other musical styles of the Río de la Plata region. It was founded in the early 2000s as a studio experiment, which culminated into the successful album ''Bajofondo Tango Club''. This led to touring and eventually to the current lineup. Bajofondo calls itself a collaborative as all members have solo careers as well. The group has toured around the world, particularly in Latin America, the United States, Europe and parts of Asia. Their music is known to a wider audience than those who know their name as their music has been used in film and television.",
