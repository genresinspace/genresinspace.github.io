  "name": "Django Reinhardt",
  "description": "'''Jean Reinhardt''' (23 January 1910 – 16 May 1953), known by his [[Romani people|Romani]] nickname '''Django''' ({{IPA|fr|dʒãŋɡo ʁɛjnaʁt|lang}} or {{IPA|fr|dʒɑ̃ɡo ʁenɑʁt|}}), was a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born Romani jazz guitarist and composer who lived most of his life in [[France]]. He was one of the first major [[jazz]] talents to emerge in Europe and has been hailed as one of its most significant exponents.\n\nWith violinist [[Stéphane Grappelli]], Reinhardt formed the Paris-based [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]] in 1934. The group was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including [[Coleman Hawkins]] and [[Benny Carter]], and briefly toured the United States with [[Duke Ellington]]'s orchestra in 1946. He died suddenly of a brain hemorrhage in 1953 at the age of 43.\n\nReinhardt's most popular compositions have become standards within [[gypsy jazz]], including \"[[Minor Swing (song)|Minor Swing]]\", \"Daphne\", \"Belleville\", \"Djangology\", \"Swing '42\", and \"[[Nuages (song)|Nuages]]\". The jazz guitarist [[Frank Vignola]] said that nearly every major popular music guitarist in the world has been influenced by Reinhardt. Over the last few decades, annual Django festivals have been held throughout Europe and the U.S., and a biography has been written about his life. In February 2017, the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] held the world premiere of the French biographical film [[Django (2017 film)|''Django'']], based on Reinhardt's life.",
