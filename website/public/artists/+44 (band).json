  "description": "'''+44''' (read as '''Plus Forty-four''') was an American [[Rock music|rock]] [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in Los Angeles, California, in 2005. The group consisted of vocalist and bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] and drummer [[Travis Barker]] of [[Blink-182]], lead guitarist [[Shane Gallagher]] of [[the Nervous Return]], and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of [[Mercy Killers]]. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the initial 2005 breakup of Blink-182 and before it was later reformed. The band's name refers to the [[List of country calling codes|international dialing code]] of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely [[Electronic music|electronic]] in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl [[Punk rock|punk]] quartet Get the Girl.\n\nThe band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although anticipated by the music press, the band's only album—''[[When Your Heart Stops Beating]]'' (2006)—underperformed commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from critics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the [[Honda Civic Tour]] alongside [[Fall Out Boy]]. Hoppus later began preparing material for a second +44 album, but the group went inactive with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}}",
