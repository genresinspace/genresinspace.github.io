  "description": "'''Oliver Sunday Akanite''' (14 April 1947 â€“ 20 June 2008), better known by the stage name '''Oliver De Coque''', was a Nigerian [[Igbo highlife]] musician, composer and guitarist and one of Africa's most prolific recording artists spanning over four decades of the highlife music scene. His extensive use of Igbo traditional rhythms and the fusion of Congolese guitar melodies made him a leader in the Nigerian highlife music genre. \n\nOliver's stage name, \"Oliver De Coque\", originated from his early days playing [[Ekpili]] music in 1976. His band was initially called \"'''Oliver de coque and co-singers'''\", and people affectionally referred to him as \"<nowiki/>'''Oliver De Ka Okwe<nowiki/>'''\" due to his love for playing ''okwe'' (draft). Over time, he adapted this nickname to create the household name Oliver De Coque.",
