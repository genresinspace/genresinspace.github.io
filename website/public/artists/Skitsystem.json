  "description": "'''Skitsystem''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈɧîːtsʏˌsteːm}}; literally \"Shit System\") is a Swedish [[crust punk]] band formed in early 1994. The band members originally came from different death metal bands, bonding over a common interest in punk music, particularly [[D-beat]]. Initially the group was a side-project of two members of [[At the Gates]]. The band announced in December 2007 that they were on indefinite hiatus. However in November 2009, Skitsystem signified their return to activity after the group announced plans to play two shows in [[Gothenburg]] in late February 2010.\n\nFrontman Fredrik Wallenberg cites the group's initial influences as [[Anti Cimex]], Asocial, [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], [[Doom (British band)|Doom]] and [[Disrupt]].",
