  "description": "'''Stan Getz''' (born '''Stanley Gayetski'''; February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American [[jazz]] [[Saxophone|saxophonist]]. Playing primarily the [[tenor saxophone]], Getz was known as \"'''The Sound'''\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, [[Lester Young]]. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with [[Woody Herman]]'s big band, Getz is described by critic [[Scott Yanow]] as \"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\". Getz performed in [[bebop]] and [[cool jazz]] groups. Influenced by [[João Gilberto]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], he also helped popularize [[bossa nova]] in the United States with the hit 1964 single \"[[The Girl from Ipanema]]\".",
