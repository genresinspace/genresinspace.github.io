  "description": "'''The Oppressed''' are a [[Wales|Welsh]]  [[Oi!]] band that formed in 1981 in [[Cardiff]], Wales. Most of the band's lineups have been [[skinhead]]s. \n\nThroughout the band's career, the members (especially vocalist Roddy Moreno) openly expressed opposition to [[racism]] and [[fascism]] â€” in their lyrics, interviews, on-stage comments and other actions. In 1989, Moreno visited [[New York City]] and met a few members of [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice]] (SHARP). On his return to the [[United Kingdom]], he started promoting SHARP ideals to British skinheads. The band has also had ties to other anti-racist groups, such as [[Anti-Fascist Action]].  Moreno is a [[Cardiff City F.C.]] supporter, and some of the band's songs express that support.\n\nThe band has split and re-formed several times, the first occasion being in 1984, after which Moreno focused on his record labels, Oi! Records and Ska Records for the remainder of the decade.\n\nAfter splitting in 2016, they re-formed in 2020 with a line-up of Roddy Moreno (vocals/guitar), fellow founder member Russell \"Ducky\" Payne (guitar), Che Jones (drums) and Ross Goldworthy (bass).",
