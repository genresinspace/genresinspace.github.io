  "name": "Bosse-de-Nage",
  "description": "'''Bosse-de-Nage''' is an American [[black metal]] band from [[San Francisco]], [[California]], composed of four anonymous members. Considered a part of the [[blackgaze]] scene, their experimental style draws from [[post-rock]], [[shoegazing|shoegaze]], [[post-hardcore]], [[screamo]], and [[indie rock]].  The band's influences include the post-rock bands [[Slint]], [[Mogwai (band)|Mogwai]], and [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]]. [[AllMusic]] critic Gregory Heaney deemed their sound to be \"as comfortable expanding outward as it is contracting into a suffocating mass of needling guitars and frantic drumming.\" Bosse-de-Nage's lyrics touch on subjects like sex, filth, bodies, perversion, and death. Their name is taken from French [[Symbolism (movement)|symbolist]] [[Alfred Jarry]]'s book ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician]]''; it is the name of a monkey which may or may not have been a hallucination of the narrator.",
