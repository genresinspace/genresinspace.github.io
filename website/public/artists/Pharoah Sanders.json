  "description": "'''Pharoah Sanders''' (born '''Ferrell Lee Sanders'''; October 13, 1940 – September 24, 2022) was an American [[jazz]] saxophonist. Known for his [[overblowing]], harmonic, and [[multiphonic]] techniques on the saxophone, as well as his use of \"[[sheets of sound]]\", Sanders played a prominent role in the development of [[free jazz]] and [[spiritual jazz]] through his work as a member of [[John Coltrane]]'s groups in the mid-1960s, and later through his solo work. He released more than thirty albums as a leader and collaborated extensively with vocalist [[Leon Thomas]] and pianist [[Alice Coltrane]], among many others. Fellow saxophonist [[Ornette Coleman]] once described him as \"probably the best [[tenor sax|tenor]] player in the world\".\n\nSanders' take on spiritual jazz was rooted in his inspiration from religious concepts such as ''[[karma]]'' and ''[[tawhid]]'', and his rich, meditative performance aesthetic. This style was seen as a continuation of Coltrane's work on albums such as ''[[A Love Supreme]]''. As a result, Sanders was considered to have been a disciple of Coltrane or, as [[Albert Ayler]] said, \"Trane was the [[God the Father|Father]], Pharoah was [[God the Son|the Son]], I am [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|the Holy Ghost]]\".",
