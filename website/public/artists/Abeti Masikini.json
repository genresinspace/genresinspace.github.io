  "description": "'''Elisabeth Finant''' (9 November 1954 – 28 September 1994), known professionally as '''Abeti Fina-Masikini''' or simply '''Abeti Masikini''', was a Congolese singer, composer, bandleader, and philanthropist. With a nearly three-decades-long career, she was a significant figure in 20th-century [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] and [[African popular music]]. Often referred to as the \"'''Queen of [[Soukous]]'''\", she is noted for advocating [[gender equality]], modernizing Congolese music, and inspiring successive generations of musicians. Her band, Les Redoutables, was a launching pad for numerous female artists.\n\nBorn in [[Kisangani]], then part of the [[Belgian Congo]] and now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Masikini made her public debut in 1971 after being discovered by [[Togo]]lese producer Gérard Akueson, following her feat in the ''Découverte des Jeunes Talents'' music contest organized by singer Gérard Madiata. Her debut album, ''Pierre Cardin Présente: Abeti'', released in 1973, propelled her into the limelight, earning televised prominence and selling out numerous venues such as Paris's [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia Hall]] and New York's [[Carnegie Hall]]. Over her three-decade career, Masikini recorded over twenty studio albums for a variety of record labels including Les Disques Pierre Cardin, [[Pathé Records]], Aziza, [[RCA Records]], [[Polygram Records]], among others. \n\nA trailblazer for [[Women in Africa|African women]] in music, Masikini was the first Congolese female artist to lead her own band and perform in major international venues such as Carnegie Hall, [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[Wembley Arena]], and the [[Apollo Theater]]. She died of [[uterine cancer]] on 28 September 1994, in [[Villejuif]], [[Paris]].",
