  "description": "'''Uncle Tupelo''' was an [[alternative country]] music group from [[Belleville, Illinois]], active between 1987 and 1994. [[Jay Farrar]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], and [[Mike Heidorn]] formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with [[Sire Records]] and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'', Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed [[Son Volt]] with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as [[Wilco]].\n\nAlthough Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene. The group's first album, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the [[hardcore punk]] of [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] and the country instrumentation and harmony of the [[Carter Family]] and [[Hank Williams]]. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] and the [[working class]] of Belleville.",
