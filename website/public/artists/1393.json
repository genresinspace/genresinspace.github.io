  "description": "'''Horst Christian Simco''' (born January 29, 1982), known professionally as '''Riff Raff''' (often stylized as '''RiFF RAFF'''), is an American rapper from [[Katy, Texas]]. He was originally managed by [[Swishahouse]] co-founder [[OG Ron C]] in 2011. After initially signing with [[Soulja Boy]]'s record label [[Stacks on Deck Entertainment]], Simco signed with producer [[Diplo]]'s [[Mad Decent]] label to release his debut studio album, ''[[Neon Icon]]'' (2014). Despite mixed critical response, it moderately entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] along with his second album ''[[Peach Panther]]'' (2016), which was released by [[Warner Records]]. Prior to the latter's release, Simco entered a US$4 million joint partnership with Stampede Management and [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] for his Neon Nation label and production company. The joint deal fell apart in the wake of legal disputes following the release of the 2012 film ''[[Spring Breakers#Riff Raff|Spring Breakers]]''.\n\nSimco was formerly a member of the hip hop group [[Three Loco]], along with [[Andy Milonakis]] and [[Dirt Nasty]], who reunited on his ''Balloween'' 2016 Halloween mixtape performing \"Bitches in my Driveway\". The trio premiered a Christmas parody song, \"Ho-Ho-Loco\", in the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] ''Surprise! Instant Xmas Carol'' special. In February 2018, Riff Raff signed with singer [[Blackbear (musician)|Blackbear]]'s Beartrap Sound for a reported US$500,000.",
