  "description": "'''Davlatmand Kholov''' ({{langx|tg|Давлатманд Холов}}; 26 October 1950 – 18 February 2024) was a Tajik musician and singer from [[Kulab, Tajikistan|Kulob]]. He was an expert in the southern folk genre of Tajik music called ''Falak'' (lit. \"the firmament\"). A multi-instrumentalist, trained in [[Shashmaqam]] at the Conservatory of Music in [[Dushanbe]], he was well-known for his works on the two-string [[dutar]], [[ghijak]], and [[setar]] which are popular instruments in Central Asia.\n\nKholov played and sang poetry of the Sufi poets, mainly Jalaleddin [[Rumi]];  Davlatmand's outlook was close to Rumi's poetry and philosophy. He also belonged to the post-Soviet nationalist school of thought, or was influenced by \"Tajikisation\", therefore turning his back on Tajik [[shashmaqam]].  This can be displayed through his works: ''Sawt-i Falak'' or \"The Voices of Falak\", where he creates European symphonic settings to tell tales of Tajik life and rural practices. He released the album ''Learned & Folk Music'' on 9 January 1996.\n\nKholov died on 18 February 2024, at the age of 73 from cancer.",
