  "description": "'''Joshua Daniel White''' (February 11, 1914 â€“ September 5, 1969) was an American singer, guitarist, songwriter, actor and civil rights activist. He also recorded under the names '''Pinewood Tom''' and '''Tippy Barton''' in the 1930s.\n\nWhite grew up in the [[Southern United States|South]] during the 1920s and 1930s. He became a prominent [[race records]] artist, with a prolific output of recordings in genres including [[Piedmont blues]], [[country blues]], [[gospel music]], and [[Protest song|social protest]] songs. In 1931, White moved to New York, and within a decade his fame had spread widely. His repertoire expanded to include [[Chicago blues|urban blues]], [[jazz]], [[Traditional music|traditional]] [[folk song]]s, and political protest songs, and he was in demand as an actor on radio, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and film.\n\nHowever, White's anti-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] and international human rights political stance presented in many of his recordings and in his speeches at rallies were subsequently used by [[McCarthyites]] as a pretext for labeling him a communist to slander and harass him. From 1947 through the mid-1960s, White was caught up in the [[anti-communist]] [[Red Scare]], and as a consequence his career suffered. Nonetheless, White's musical style would go on to influence several generations of musical artists. In 2023, he was inducted in the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].",
