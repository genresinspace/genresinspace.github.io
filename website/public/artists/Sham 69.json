They changed their musical direction after seeing the [[Sex Pistols]] play live in early 1976. They were one of the most successful punk bands in the United Kingdom, achieving five top 20 singles, including \"[[If the Kids Are United]]\" and \"[[Hurry Up Harry]]\". The group's popularity saw them perform on the BBCâ€™s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and they appeared in the rockumentary film ''[[D.O.A.: A Rite of Passage|D.O.A.]]''. The original unit broke up in 1980, with frontman [[Jimmy Pursey]] moving on to pursue a solo career.\n\nIn 1987, Pursey and guitarist David Parsons reformed the band, joined by new personnel. Although subsequently going through a number of line-up changes, Sham 69 remained active and were still playing gigs as of 2024.",
