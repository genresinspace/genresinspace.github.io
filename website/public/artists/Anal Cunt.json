  "description": "'''Anal Cunt''', also called '''AxCx''' and '''A.C.''', was an American [[grindcore]] band that formed in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], in 1988. From its inception, the band underwent a number of line-up changes and never had a bassist. The band, known for its flippant and noisy musical style as well as controversial lyrics, released eight full-length studio albums in addition to [[Anal Cunt discography|a number of compilations and extended plays]]. Anal Cunt disbanded in 2011 after the group's founder and frontman, [[Seth Putnam]], died of a suspected heart attack.\n\nThe band is often referred to by their initials A.C. (often written as AxCx) due to the offensive nature of their name and censorship limits on some radio and publications, and many of their album covers simply display the initials A.C. However, the band managed to subvert even this abbreviation by drawing these letters in a manner resembling an [[anus]] and a [[vulva]], which can be seen on many of their albums.\n\nPutnam originally formed the band as a joke, and they intended to only record one demo and do one show; however, they were active up to 2011, despite several brief break-ups.{{Citation needed|date=August 2025}} The group's early material contained no pre-written lyrics or music and instead relied on improvised, loud, fast, unintelligible screaming. The band gradually incorporate more riffs and pre-written lyrics into their songs, as well as earned the reputation for being intentionally outrageous and obscene. 2010 and 2011 saw the release of their final two albums: a \"[[cock rock]]\" album titled ''Fuckin' A'', and an album similar to their older material called ''Wearing Out Our Welcome''.",
