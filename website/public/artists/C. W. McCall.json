  "description": "'''William Dale Fries Jr.''' (November 15, 1928 – April 1, 2022) was an American [[commercial artist]] who won several [[Clio Awards]] for his advertising campaigns. He was also a musician remembered for his character '''C. W. McCall''', a [[truck-driving country]] singer that he created for a series of bread commercials while working for an Omaha advertising agency as an art director. Fries performed as McCall in a series of [[outlaw country|outlaw]] albums and songs in the 1970s, in collaboration with co-worker [[Chip Davis]] who also founded [[Mannheim Steamroller]].\n\nMcCall's most successful song was \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\", a surprise hit in 1975, reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in March 1976. After a successful spell of touring, Fries retired to [[Ouray, Colorado]], where he was elected mayor, serving from 1986 to 1992. The \"Convoy\" song became an anthem for the [[Freedom Convoy]] protests in 2022 and Fries enjoyed this revival before he died of cancer at the age of 93.",
