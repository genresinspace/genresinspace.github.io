His music is characterised by its progressive/uplifting style. He started making music in 1995 and released the platinum-selling [[hit single]] \"[[Sandstorm (instrumental)|Sandstorm]]\" in late 1999. His debut studio album, ''[[Before the Storm (Darude album)|Before the Storm]]'', was released on 18 September 2000, and sold 800,000 copies worldwide, earning Darude three Finnish Grammy Awards. It peaked at number one on [[Finland's Official List]] and number 6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart in the United States. Darude's second studio album, ''[[Rush (Darude album)|Rush]]'', reached number 11 on the ''Billboard'' dance chart in 2003 and number 4 on [[The Official Finnish Charts|weekly album chart in Finland]].\n\nHis third studio album, ''[[Label This!]]'' was released in 2007. Though it did not chart as high as his previous albums, ''[[Gawker]]'' praised the album's single \"In the Darkness\" as \"a floating, gossamer piece of trance music... it's tightly composed, easy to dance to, and has a soaring, undeniable hook.\" In 2011, he co-founded the record label '''EnMass Music''', through which he has released a number of mix compilations related to his radio show ''Salmiakki Sessions.'' After performing at festivals such as the tenth anniversary of [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland]] in 2014 and [[Future Music Festival]] in 2015, he released his most recent studio album, ''[[Moments (Darude album)|Moments]]'', on August 14, 2015, followed by a tour of the United States and Canada in September 2015.
