His stage name was given to him by his late brother, who adapted his childhood nickname \"Mr. Pooh\" with the [[African American Vernacular English|vernacular]] slang term \"[[wikt:shiesty|shiesty]]\", which he felt was referential of his lifestyle. In 2020, he was signed to fellow rapper [[Gucci Mane]]'s [[1017 Records]], an imprint of [[Atlantic Records]], where he rose to prominence following his collaborations with the label's founder and fellow signees. That same year, he released the single \"[[Back in Blood (song)|Back in Blood]]\" (featuring [[Lil Durk]]), which reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Shortly after, he was featured on the second version of the single \"[[Beat Box (SpotemGottem song)|Beat Box]]\" by [[SpotemGottem]], which peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and became his highest-charting song. In early 2021, Shiesty released his debut mixtape, ''[[Shiesty Season]]'', which peaked at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. He was sentenced to five years in prison on [[firearms]] [[criminal conspiracy|conspiracy]] charges in mid-2021 but was released early in late 2025. Following Shiesty's release, he released his comeback single, \"[[FDO (song)|FDO]]\", which reached number 12 on the Hot 100 and became his highest-charting song as a lead artist, tying \"Beat Box 2\" as his highest in general.",
