  "description": "'''Scott & Charlene's Wedding''' are an Australian indie rock [[musical ensemble|band]], formed in [[Melbourne]] in 2006. The band currently consists of vocalist and guitarist Craig Dermody, bassist Jack Farley and drummer Joe Alexander. Dermody is also the principal songwriter and founder, and by 2013, the band had undergone numerous line-up changes with \"30 or 40 people in total\" having joined.\n\nThe band's name is taken from the 1987 wedding between [[Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell]] (played by [[Jason Donovan]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], respectively) on the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]''. Dermody stated: \"I remember sitting down and watching it with my mum. ... I remember the wedding being massive, it was as if it was a real wedding. Like a royal wedding, but in Australia.\" When asked if he actually liked the show, Dermody responded, \"No, I hate ''Neighbours''. It was just for a [[bogan]] reference. I used to watch it with my mum when I was young so it reminds me of [[Adelaide]]\".",
