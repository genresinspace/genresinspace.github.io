  "name": "Blue Scholars",
  "description": "'''Blue Scholars''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], created in 2002 while the members, [[Disc Jockey|DJ]] [[Sabzi (musician)|Sabzi]] (Saba Mohajerjasbi) and [[Master of Ceremonies|MC]] Geologic (George Quibuyen), were students at the [[University of Washington]].\n\nThe name \"Blue Scholars\" is a play on the term \"[[blue-collar worker|blue collar]],\" an [[idiom]] for workers who often earn hourly wages for manual labor. Their music and lyrics frequently focus on struggles between socioeconomic classes, challenging authority and youth empowerment. These themes are often specifically addressed in relation to the Seattle region (\"Southside Revival\", \"North by Northwest\", \"50 Thousand Deep\", \"Joe Metro\", \"Slick Watts\" and \"[[The Ave]]\"), and heavily draw upon Geologic's history as an activist within the [[Filipino American]] community dealing with issues of immigration, racism, and U.S. imperialism in the [[Philippines]]. Recent music has begun to extend even further outward, reflecting the group's greater [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and Pacific roots including an album devoted to exploring Geo's [[Hawaiian people|Hawaiian]] heritage on the ''[[OOF! EP]]''.",
