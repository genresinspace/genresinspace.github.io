  "description": "'''The Black Keys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] duo formed in [[Akron, Ohio]] in 2001. The group consists of [[Dan Auerbach]] ([[guitar]], [[Singing|vocals]]) and [[Patrick Carney]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). The duo began as an [[Independent music|independent]] act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular [[garage rock]] artists during a [[Garage rock revival|second wave of the genre's revival]] in the [[2000s in music|2000s]]. The band's raw [[blues rock]] sound draws heavily from Auerbach's [[blues]] influences, including [[Junior Kimbrough]], [[R.L. Burnside]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], and [[Robert Johnson]].\n\nFriends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney formed the group after dropping out of college. After signing with [[Independent record label|indie label]] [[Alive Naturalsound Records|Alive]], they released their debut album, ''[[The Big Come Up]]'' (2002), which earned them a new deal with [[Fat Possum Records]]. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad [[music licensing|licensing]] of their songs. Their third album, ''[[Rubber Factory]]'' (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label [[Nonesuch Records]] in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo recorded ''[[Attack & Release]]'' (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], who subsequently became a frequent collaborator of the group.\n\nThe group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with the album ''[[Brothers (The Black Keys album)|Brothers]]'', which along with its popular single \"[[Tighten Up (The Black Keys song)|Tighten Up]]\", won three [[Grammy Awards]]. Their 2011 follow-up ''[[El Camino (The Black Keys album)|El Camino]]'' received critical acclaim and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the [[El Camino Tour]]. The album and its hit single \"[[Lonely Boy (The Black Keys song)|Lonely Boy]]\" won another three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, ''[[Turn Blue (album)|Turn Blue]]'', their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia. After completing the Turn Blue Tour in 2015, the duo took a hiatus for several years to work on side projects and produce other artists. They returned in 2019 with their ninth album, ''[[Let's Rock (The Black Keys album)|Let's Rock]]''. They have since released three additional studio albums: ''[[Delta Kream]]'' (2021), consisting of [[hill country blues]] [[cover version|covers]]; ''[[Dropout Boogie]]'' (2022); and ''[[Ohio Players (album)|Ohio Players]]'' (2024).",
