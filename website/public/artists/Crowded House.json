  "description": "'''Crowded House''' are an Australian-New Zealand rock band, formed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], in 1985. Its founding members were [[Neil Finn]] (vocalist, guitarist, primary songwriter) and [[Paul Hester]] (drums), who were both former members of [[Split Enz]], and [[Nick Seymour]] (bass). Later band members included Finn's brother [[Tim Finn|Tim]], who was in their former band [[Split Enz]]; sons [[Liam Finn|Liam]] and Elroy; as well as Americans [[Mark Hart]] and [[Matt Sherrod]]. Neil Finn and Seymour are the sole constant members.\n\nOriginally active from 1985 to 1996, Crowded House had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand. They achieved success in the United States with their [[Crowded House (album)|self-titled debut album]], which provided the Top Ten hits \"[[Don't Dream It's Over]]\" and \"[[Something So Strong]]\". Further international success came in the UK, Europe, and South Africa in the early 1990s with their third and fourth albums (''[[Woodface]]'' and ''[[Together Alone]]'') and the compilation album ''[[Recurring Dream]]'', which included the hits \"[[Fall at Your Feet]]\", \"[[Weather with You]]\", \"[[Distant Sun]]\", \"[[Locked Out (Crowded House song)|Locked Out]]\", \"[[Instinct (song)|Instinct]]\", and \"[[Not the Girl You Think You Are]]\". Neil and Tim Finn were each awarded an [[OBE]] in June 1993 for their contributions to the music of New Zealand.\n\nCrowded House disbanded in 1996 following several farewell concerts that year, including the \"[[Farewell to the World]]\" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. Hester died by suicide in 2005. A year later, the group re-formed with drummer Matt Sherrod and released two further albums (''[[Time on Earth]]'' and ''[[Intriguer]]''), each of which reached number one in Australia. The band went on another hiatus, and reunited in 2020 with a new line-up featuring Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, [[Mitchell Froom]], and Finn's sons Liam and Elroy. Their most recent album, ''[[Gravity Stairs]]'', was released in 2024.\n\nAs of 2021, Crowded House have sold over 15 million albums worldwide. In November 2016, the band was inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].",
