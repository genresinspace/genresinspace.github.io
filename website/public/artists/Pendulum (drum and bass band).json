  "description": "'''Pendulum''' is an Australian [[electronic rock]] band founded in 2002. Pendulum originally formed in the city of [[Perth, Western Australia]], by [[Rob Swire]], Gareth McGrillen and Paul \"El Hornet\" Harding. The band was later expanded to include members Ben Mount, [[Peredur ap Gwynedd]] and [[KJ Sawka]]. The group is notable for its distinctive sound, mixing [[electronic music]] with [[hard rock]] and covering a wide range of genres.\n\nTheir debut studio album, ''[[Hold Your Colour]]'', was released in 2005 to positive critical reception. While ''Hold Your Colour'' was mostly of the [[drum and bass]] genre, the succeeding albums ''[[In Silico (Pendulum album)|In Silico]]'' and ''[[Immersion (album)|Immersion]]'' saw experimentation of other genres such as [[industrial rock]] and electronic rock.\n\nIn 2012, the band went on hiatus as Swire and McGrillen concentrated on their side-project Knife Party. In 2015, the band reformed and released the remix album ''[[The Reworks]]'' in 2018. The band have since released the EPs ''Elemental'' (2021) and ''Anima'' (2023), and in 2025 announced a fourth album ''[[Inertia (Pendulum album)|Inertia]]''.",
