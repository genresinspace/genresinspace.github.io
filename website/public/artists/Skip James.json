[[AllMusic]] stated: \"Coupling an oddball guitar tuning set against eerie, falsetto vocals, James' early recordings could make the hair stand up on the back of your neck.\"\n\nHis guitar playing is noted for its dark, [[Minor key|minor-key]] sound, played in an open D-minor tuning with an intricate [[Fingerstyle|fingerpicking]] technique. James first recorded for [[Paramount Records]] in 1931, but these recordings sold poorly, having been released during  the [[Great Depression]], and he drifted into obscurity.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye, James was rediscovered in 1964 by blues enthusiasts including [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], helping further the [[American folk music revival|blues and folk music revival]] of the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, James appeared at folk and blues festivals, gave concerts around the country, and recorded several albums for various record labels. His songs have influenced generations of musicians and have been adapted by numerous artists.  He has been hailed as \"one of the seminal figures of the blues\".",
