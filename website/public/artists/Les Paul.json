His early experiments with [[overdubbing]] (also known as [[History of sound recording#Electrical recording|sound on sound]]), [[Delay (audio effect)|delay effects]] such as tape delay, [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]], and [[multitrack recording]] were among the first to attract widespread attention. His [[Lick (music)|lick]]s, [[Trill (music)|trill]]s, [[chording]] sequences, [[Fingerboard#Frets|fretting]] techniques, and timing set him apart from his contemporaries and inspired many guitarists of the present day.\n\nAmong his many honors, Paul is one of a handful of artists with a permanent exhibit in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. He is prominently named by the music museum on its website as an \"architect\" and a \"key inductee\" with [[Sam Phillips]] and [[Alan Freed]].
