  "description": "'''Fellini''' was a Brazilian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[São Paulo]] in 1984 by [[Cadão Volpato]] (vocals, harmonica), Jair Marcos (guitar), Ricardo Salvagni (drums and percussion), and former [[Voluntários da Pátria]] and [[Smack (Brazilian band)|Smack]] member Thomas Pappon (bass and occasionally other instruments). One of the most well-known bands of the Brazilian underground scene of the mid-1980s (and having a strong [[cult following]] to the present day), Fellini originally began as a straightforward post-punk band influenced by acts such as [[Joy Division]], [[The Stranglers]] and [[The Durutti Column]], but would gradually develop a more eclectic sonority that mixed post-punk with other genres such as [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[samba rock]], acquiring a unique, almost non-descript musical style.\n\nFellini was first disestablished in 1990, but re-established in 2002 until ending again in 2010. A further reunion of the band was announced in early 2016.",
