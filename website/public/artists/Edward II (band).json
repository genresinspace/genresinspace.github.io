  "description": "'''Edward II''' (known also as '''EII''', and previously as '''Edward the Second and the Red Hot Polkas''' and '''e2K''') are an English band which play a fusion of [[world music]], [[English folk music|English folk]] and [[reggae]].\n\nActive from 1980, the band broke up after losing several key members in 1999, relaunching as \"e2K\" in 2000. In 2003, the band dissolved once more, but have since reformed for a one-year reunion tour in 2009 under the \"Edward II\" name, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the breakup of the original band. They reformed in 2015 specifically to produce the Manchester's Improving Daily project, which includes the release of new recorded material and a book.\n\nThe project is designed to celebrate a collection of tunes written in Manchester during the Industrial Revolution, published as Broadsides and currently held in Manchester Central Library.\nIn 2021 Edward II released the album \"Dancing Tunes\", bringing their own unique style to a collection of traditional and historic Jamaican calypso and mento songs that pre-date reggae as we know it today.",
