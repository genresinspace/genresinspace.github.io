  "description": "'''In Extremo''' ([[Latin]] for ''At the Edge''; abbreviated '''InEx''' or '''IE''') is a German [[medieval metal]] band from [[Berlin]]. Their musical style combines heavy metal music with medieval traditional songs, blending the sound of the standard rock/metal instruments with historical instruments (such as [[bagpipe]]s, [[harp]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], and [[shawm]]). At the beginning of their musical career, versions of well-known traditional/medieval ballads constituted a major part of their repertoire; however, in recent years, the band has written a large amount of original musical material. Their own material is written mostly in German, whilst the traditional songs and cover songs are in a variety of languages.",
