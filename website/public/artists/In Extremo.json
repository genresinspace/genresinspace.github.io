  "description": "'''In Extremo''' ([[Latin]] for ''At the Edge''; abbreviated '''InEx''' or '''IE''') is a German [[medieval metal]] band from [[Berlin]]. Their musical style combines heavy metal music with traditional medieval songs, blending the sound of the standard rock/metal instruments with historical instruments (such as [[bagpipe]]s, [[harp]], [[hurdy-gurdy]], and [[shawm]]). At the beginning of their musical career, versions of well-known traditional and medieval ballads made up a major part of their repertoire. In recent years, however, the band has written a large amount of original musical material. Their own songs are written mostly in German, while the traditional songs they perform and the songs they cover are in a variety of languages.",
