  "description": "'''In Extremo''' ([[Latin]] for ''At the Edge''; abbreviated '''InEx''' or '''IE''') is a German [[medieval metal]] band originally from [[Berlin]]. The band's musical style combines metal with medieval traditional songs, blending the sound of the standard rock/metal instruments with historical instruments (such as [[bagpipe]]s, [[harp]], [[hurdy-gurdy]] and [[shawm]]). Versions of well-known traditional/medieval ballads once made up the main part of their repertoire, but the band has written an increasing share of original material in recent years. Their own material is written mostly in German, whilst the traditional songs and cover songs are in a variety of languages.",
