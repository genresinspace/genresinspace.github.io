His first five records, released under the name [[Burzum]] from 1992 to 1996, made him one of the most influential figures in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. He was convicted of murder and arson in 1994 and sentenced to 21 years in prison, being released after serving 15 years.\n\nA native of [[Fana, Bergen|Fana]] in [[Bergen Municipality]], Vikernes began playing guitar at the age of 14 and formed his first band, Kalashnikov (later known as Uruk-Hai), by 1989. He went on to join the band [[Old Funeral]], in which he played guitar from 1989 until his departure in 1991. He recorded multiple tracks with the band, which were featured on the ''Devoured Carcass'' [[EP]], as well as various compilation albums released years later. In 1992, Vikernes, along with other members of the scene, was suspected of burning down four Christian churches in Norway. Vikernes denied committing the arsons, though he supported them. In 1992–1993, he also recorded bass for [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s debut studio album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' (1994).\n\nIn August 1993, Vikernes fatally stabbed Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous]] during an altercation at the latter's apartment, and was arrested shortly after. In May 1994, Vikernes was convicted of [[first-degree murder]], church arson and possession of explosives. Vikernes has always maintained the killing was [[self-defense]], and unsuccessfully argued for the charge to be reduced to [[voluntary manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum penalty under Norwegian law. During his incarceration, Vikernes launched the [[neo-Nazi]] organisation [[Heathen Front|Norwegian Heathen Front]], had two books published, and released two [[ambient music|ambient]] albums as Burzum. In 2009, he was released on parole, after which he moved to France with his wife and children, where he has continued to write and make music. He was also an active video blogger on his [[YouTube]] channel ThuleanPerspective, before the channel was banned by the platform.\n\nDescribed by [[Sam Dunn]] as \"the most notorious metal musician of all time\", Vikernes remains controversial for his crimes as well as his political and religious views. He promoted views which combined [[Odinism]] and [[Esoteric Nazism]], and openly embraced Nazism during the mid-to-late 1990s. He has continued to be associated with [[far-right]] politics. Vikernes calls his beliefs \"[[Odal (SS-rune)|Odalism]]\" and defends a \"[[pre-industrial]] European [[pagan]] society\" that opposes the [[Abrahamic religions]] and systems such as [[capitalism]], [[communism]], [[Economic materialism|materialism]], and [[socialism]].",
