  "description": "'''Shub-Niggurath''' was a French rock band founded in 1982 by Alain Ballaud, and remained active until Ballaud's death from cancer in 1995. The band is named after one of the [[deity|deities]] in [[Cthulhu Mythos]] created by the American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]].\n\nThe band was created after the bands [[Aspara]] and [[Gorgonus]] were merged together. Ann Stewart and Franck W. Fromy from the former, Véronique Verdier, Jean-Luc Hervé, and Allain Ballaud from the latter. Drummers had to be changed often, due to the difficulty of certain compositions, which were at times too free-form, or too strictly written at others.\n\nTheir debut album was ''Les Morts Vont Vite'', released in 1986 by Musea label, received critical acclaim for its innovative [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] inclinations, and major developments influenced by [[Magma (band)|Magma]]'s \"Zeuhl\" style.\n\nTheir self-titled demo tape has been reissued on CD and Vinyl in 2018 by the label [[Soleil Zeuhl]].",
