  "description": "'''Brian Wayne Transeau''' (born October 4, 1971), known by his initials as '''BT''', is an American musician, DJ, singer, songwriter, record producer, composer, and audio engineer. An artist in the [[electronic music]] genre, he is credited as a pioneer of the [[Trance music|trance]] and [[intelligent dance music]] styles that paved the way for [[Electronic dance music|EDM]], and for \"stretching electronic music to its technical breaking point.\" In 2010, he was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album]] for ''[[These Hopeful Machines]]''. He creates music within myriad styles, such as classical, film composition, and bass music.\n\nBT holds multiple patents for pioneering the technique he calls [[stutter edit]]ing. This production technique consists of taking a small fragment of sound and repeating it rhythmically, often at audio rate values while processing the resultant stream using advanced digital processing techniques. BT was entered into the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for his song \"[[Somnambulist (Simply Being Loved)]]\", recognized as using the largest number of vocal edits in a song (6,178 edits). BT's work with stutter edit techniques led to the formation of software development company Sonik Architects, developer of the sound-processing software plug-ins Stutter Edit and BreakTweaker, and Phobos with [[Spitfire Audio]].\n\nBT has produced, collaborated, and written with a variety of artists, including [[Death Cab for Cutie]], [[Howard Jones (English musician)|Howard Jones]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[David Bowie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Markus Schulz]], [[Armin van Buuren]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[Tori Amos]], [[NSYNC]], [[Blake Lewis]], [[The Roots]], [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Paul van Dyk]], and [[TiÃ«sto]]. He has composed original scores for films such as ''[[Go (1999 film)|Go]]'', ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', and ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]'', and his scores and compositions have appeared on television series such as ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', and ''[[Electric Dreams (2017 TV series)|Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams]]''. He was commissioned to compose a four-hour, 256 channel installation composition for the [[Tomorrowland (Disney Parks)|Tomorrowland]]-themed area at [[Shanghai Disneyland]], which opened in 2016.",
