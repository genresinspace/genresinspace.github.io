  "name": "Ojos de Brujo",
  "description": "'''Ojos de Brujo''' was a nine-piece band from [[Barcelona]] who described their style as \"jipjop flamenkillo\" ([[Hip hop music|hip hop]] with a little [[flamenco]]). The band sold over 100,000 copies of their self-produced ''Barí''  album and received several awards, among these the [[BBC Radio 3]] World Music Award for Europe in 2004, having also been nominated in 2003.\n\nTheir success is also notable for being achieved without the aid of label backing. They set up their own label, La Fábrica de Colores, to get complete artistic freedom for ''Barí'', away from the pressure they perceived from their record company [[Edel Records]] for their debut, ''Vengue''.",
