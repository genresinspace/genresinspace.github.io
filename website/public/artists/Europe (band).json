  "description": "'''Europe''' is a Swedish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Upplands Väsby]] in 1979, by lead vocalist [[Joey Tempest]], guitarist [[John Norum]], bassist Peter Olsson, and drummer [[Tony Reno]]. They obtained a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition Rock-SM (Swedish Rock Championships); it was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.\n\nSince their formation, Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and twenty-four music videos. Europe's current lineup comprises Tempest, Norum, bassist [[John Levén]], keyboardist [[Mic Michaeli]], and drummer [[Ian Haugland]].\n\nEurope rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]''. {{as of|2003}}, Europe had sold 10 million albums worldwide. The band has had two top 20 albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart (''The Final Countdown''  and ''[[Out of This World (Europe album)|Out of This World]]'') and three top 30 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart (\"[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]\", \"[[Rock the Night (song)|Rock the Night]]\" and \"[[Carrie (Europe song)|Carrie]]\", which reached number 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100).\n\nEurope went on hiatus in 1992, reunited temporarily for a one-off performance in [[Stockholm]] on New Year's Eve 1999 and announced an official reunion in 2003. Since then the band has released six albums, ''[[Start from the Dark]]'' (2004), ''[[Secret Society (album)|Secret Society]]'' (2006), ''[[Last Look at Eden]]'' (2009), ''[[Bag of Bones (album)|Bag of Bones]]'' (2012), ''[[War of Kings (album)|War of Kings]]'' (2015) and ''[[Walk the Earth]]'' (2017).\n\nEurope gained new attention in the US after being featured in a [[GEICO]] cable television commercial campaign during 2015–2016.",
