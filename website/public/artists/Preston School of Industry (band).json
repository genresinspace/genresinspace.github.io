  "description": "'''Preston School of Industry''' was an American [[indie rock]] band formed by [[Scott Kannberg]] (a.k.a. Spiral Stairs) in 1999, following the dissolution of his previous band, [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]. Its name is taken from the well known US reform school of the same name, [[Preston School of Industry]] in [[Ione, California]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}.\n\nThe band's earliest studio release was a cover of [[Phish]]'s \"Axilla II\" for the charity tribute album ''[[Sharin' in the Groove]]''. In 2001, Preston School of Industry released ''[[All This Sounds Gas]]''.  The band released its second album, ''[[Monsoon (Preston School of Industry album)|Monsoon]]'', in 2004, with studio contributions from members of [[The Minus 5]] and [[Wilco]].\n\nPreston School of Industry went inactive after their September 2004 Australian tour, though Kannberg revealed in late 2006 he had been slowly working on a record: \"Don't know when it's going to be released. Just taking my time, nothing special. I've got the songs, I just haven't figured out how I want to do it yet. This winter, I'll probably get it done.\" However, in 2009, Kannberg released a solo album under the name Spiral Stairs.",
