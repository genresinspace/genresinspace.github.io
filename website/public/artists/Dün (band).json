  "name": "Dün (band)",
  "description": "'''Dün''' was a French [[progressive rock]] band, active from 1978 to 1981, during which they played shows with [[Magma (band)|Magma]], [[Art Zoyd]], [[Etron Fou Leloublan]], and almost became a part of the short-lived [[Rock in Opposition]] grouping of bands in Europe. In 1981, they recorded an [[album]], ''[[Eros (Dün album)|Eros]]'', that never secured proper distribution, and as a result is quite rare.\n\nThe French label Soleil reissued the ''Eros'' album, which included the four tracks from the original LP plus four bonus tracks, three of which are early [[Demo (music)|demo]] versions of the tracks on the original release.",
