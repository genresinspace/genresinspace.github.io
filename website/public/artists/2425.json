  "description": "'''Alemayehu Eshete Andarge''' (Amharic: ዓለማየሁ እሸቴ አንዳርጌ; June 1941 – 2 September 2021) was an Ethiopian singer, widely known as the \"'''Abyssinian Elvis'''\" for his dynamic performances and his fusion of traditional [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian music]] with Western rock and roll influences. He emerged in the 1960s and became a prominent figure in the [[Ethio-jazz]] movement, alongside musicians such as [[Mulatu Astatke]]. Eshete's music blended Ethiopian rhythms with elements of funk, soul, and jazz, and his hit songs include ''Temar Lije'' and ''Addis Ababa Bete''. His international recognition grew following the release of the [[Éthiopiques]] series, which featured many of his early recordings. Eshete continued to perform until his death in 2021, leaving a lasting legacy in Ethiopian and world music. His contributions were widely recognized both in Ethiopia and internationally.",
