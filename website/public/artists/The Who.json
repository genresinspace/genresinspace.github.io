  "name": "The Who",
  "description": "'''The Who''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1964. Their classic lineup (1964–1978) consisted of lead vocalist [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], bassist [[John Entwistle]] and drummer [[Keith Moon]]. Considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th&nbsp;century, their contributions to rock music include the development of the [[Marshall Stack|Marshall stack]], large [[public address system]]s, the use of [[synthesizer]]s, Entwistle's and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's [[Guitar feedback|feedback]] and [[power chord]] guitar technique, and the development of the [[rock opera]]. They are cited as an influence by many [[hard rock]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[power pop]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod]] bands. The Who were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1990.\n\nThe Who evolved from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the [[pop art]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod movements]], featuring [[auto-destructive art]] by [[Instrument destruction|destroying guitars and drums]] on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\" (1965), reached the UK top&nbsp;ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\", \"[[My Generation]]\" (both 1965), \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\", \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\" (all 1966) and \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\" (1967). In 1967, they performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and released \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", their only US top ten single. The group's 1969 [[concept album]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' included the single \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" and was a critical and commercial success.\n\nFurther festival appearances at [[Woodstock]] and the [[Isle of Wight Festival|Isle of Wight]], along with the concert album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned. Songs from the project made up the album ''[[Who's Next]]'' (1971), including the hits \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\", \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", and \"[[Behind Blue Eyes]]\". The group released another concept album, ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] (1975). Following the release of ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'' (1975), they continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.\n\n[[Kenney Jones]] replaced Moon and the group resumed touring. In 1979, they released a [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] and the retrospective [[rockumentary]] ''[[The Kids Are Alright (1979 film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''. The early 1980s brought two more albums, ''[[Face Dances]]'' (1981) and ''[[It's Hard]]'' (1982), and more successful world tours, though Townshend became weary of the group during this time, and they officially split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 with [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] on drums, and a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' during 1996–1997 with [[Zak Starkey]] on drums. A full-time reunion began in 1999, with Starkey as drummer. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]''.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour officially as a duo of Daltrey and Townsend, augmented by drummers Starkey (until 2025) and [[Scott Devours]] (since 2025), bassists [[Pino Palladino]] (2002–2016) and [[Jon Button]] (since 2017), and Pete's brother, guitarist [[Simon Townshend]]. In 2019, the group released their twelfth studio album [[Who (album)|''Who'']] and supported the album with their [[Moving On! Tour]] with a symphony orchestra.",
