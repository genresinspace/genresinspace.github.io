  "description": "'''The Strangers''' were an American country band that formed in 1966 in [[Bakersfield, California]]. They mainly served as the backup band for singer-songwriter [[Merle Haggard]], who named them after his first hit single \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]]\". In addition to serving as his backing band, members of the Strangers also produced many of Haggard's records, sang lead vocals on select tracks, and co-wrote many of Haggard's songs with him, including the No. 1 singles, \"[[Okie from Muskogee (song)|Okie From Muskogee]]\" and \"[[I Always Get Lucky with You]]\".\n\nFrom 1969 to 1973, they issued several records independent of Haggard, released on [[Capitol Records]], and even had their own Top 10 hit single called \"[[Street Singer (song)|Street Singer]]\" on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot Country Songs]] Chart. Three members of the Strangers would go on to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Between 1969 and 1987, the Strangers were voted Band of the Year by the [[Academy of Country Music]] eight timesâ€”more than any other group in history.",
