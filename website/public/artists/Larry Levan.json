  "description": "'''Lawrence Philpot''' (July 20, 1954 – November 8, 1992), known as '''Larry Levan''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|v|æ|n}} {{respell|lə|VAN}}), was an American DJ best known for his decade-long residency at the New York City night club [[Paradise Garage]], which has been described as the prototype of the modern dance club. He developed a [[cult following]] who referred to his sets as \"Saturday [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]\". Influential [[post-disco]] DJ [[François Kevorkian]] credits Levan with introducing the [[Dub music|dub]] aesthetic into dance music. Along with Kevorkian, Levan experimented with [[drum machine]]s and synthesizers in his productions and live sets, ushering in an electronic, post-disco sound that presaged the ascendence of [[house music]]. He DJ'd at [[Club Zanzibar]] in the 1980s as well, home to the Jersey Sound brand of deep house or garage house.",
