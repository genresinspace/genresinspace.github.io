Originally founded by Tyler Hyde (vocals, bass), Lewis Evans (vocals, flute, saxophone), Georgia Ellery (violin, backing vocals), May Kershaw (vocals, keyboards), Charlie Wayne (drums, backing vocals) and Isaac Wood (guitar, lead vocals), they added their then-seventh member, guitarist Luke Mark, in 2019.\n\nThe band gained initial attention through singles \"Athens, France\" and \"[[Sunglasses (Black Country, New Road song)|Sunglasses]]\" in 2019. Their debut album ''[[For the First Time (Black Country, New Road album)|For the First Time]]'', released in 2021, received widespread critical acclaim, was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]] and reached No. 4 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Four days before the release of their 2022 second album ''[[Ants from Up There]]'', Wood left the band, citing mental health struggles. The album received further critical acclaim and commercial success, debuting at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nFollowing the departure of their lead vocalist Wood, the band immediately began work on new material, with Hyde, Ellery and Kershaw sharing lead vocal duties. After touring throughout 2022, the band released the [[concert film]] ''[[Live at Bush Hall]]'', in February 2023, featuring several new compositions and songs that had been written since Wood's departure. In 2025, the band announced their third studio album ''[[Forever Howlong]]'', which was released in April 2025.",
