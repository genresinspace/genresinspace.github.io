  "description": "'''Christopher George Latore Wallace''' (May 21, 1972&nbsp;– March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names '''the Notorious B.I.G.''', '''Biggie Smalls''', or simply '''Biggie''', was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the [[East Coast hip-hop]] and [[gangsta rap]] traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting his lyrics' often [[Hardcore hip-hop|grim content]]. His music was semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration.\n\nWallace was born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], New York City. In 1993, he became the first artist to sign with [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]] and gained recognition for his guest appearances on other artists' singles. His debut studio album, ''[[Ready to Die]]'' (1994), received acclaim and included the successful singles \"[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]\", \"[[Big Poppa]]\", and \"[[One More Chance (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|One More Chance]]\". ''Ready to Die'' made Wallace the central figure of East Coast hip-hop and helped restore its prominence at a time when the [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] was dominating the genre. In 1995, Wallace was named Rapper of the Year at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], and with his [[protégé]] group, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]]—which included longtime friends like [[Lil' Kim]]—released the album ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]''.\n\nWhile working on his second album in 1995, Wallace became embroiled in the growing [[East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry]], including a feud with his former friend [[Tupac Shakur]]. After Shakur was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murdered in a drive-by shooting]] in Las Vegas in September 1996, rumors circulated suggesting that Wallace might have been involved, given the two artists' feud. In March 1997, six months after Shakur's death, [[Murder of the Notorious B.I.G.|Wallace was also killed in a drive-by shooting]] in [[Los Angeles]] by an unknown assailant. Two weeks later, ''[[Life After Death]]'' (1997) was released as a posthumous double album; it debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], yielded the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\" and \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\", and received [[RIAA certification|diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nTwo more posthumous albums followed, ''[[Duets: The Final Chapter]]'' (2005) and ''[[The King & I (Faith Evans and The Notorious B.I.G. album)|The King & I]]'' (with [[Faith Evans]]; 2017). Wallace's certified U.S. sales exceed 28{{nbsp}}million copies, including 21{{nbsp}}million albums. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called him the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\", and, in 2015, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named him [[Billboard and Vibe's 50 Greatest Rappers of All Time|the greatest rapper of all time]]. [[The Source (magazine)|''The Source'']] named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, [[MTV]] ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". In 2020, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].",
