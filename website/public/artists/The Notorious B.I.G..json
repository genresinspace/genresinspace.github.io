  "description": "'''Christopher George Latore Wallace''' (May 21, 1972&nbsp;– March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names '''the Notorious B.I.G.''', '''Biggie Smalls''', or simply '''Biggie''', was an American rapper. Rooted in the [[East Coast hip-hop|New York rap]] scene and [[gangsta rap]] traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting his lyrics' often [[Hardcore hip-hop|grim content]]. His music was usually semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York City]], Wallace was the first artist to sign with [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]] in 1993. That same year, he gained recognition for his guest appearances on other artists' singles. His debut studio album, ''[[Ready to Die]]'' (1994), received widespread critical acclaim and included signature tracks \"[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]\" and \"[[Big Poppa]]\". This album made him the central figure in [[East Coast hip-hop|East Coast hip hop]], helping to restore New York's prominence at a time when the [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] was dominating the genre. In 1995, Wallace was named Rapper of the Year at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. That same year, Wallace and his [[protégé]] group, [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.]]—which included longtime friends like [[Lil' Kim]]—released their debut album, ''[[Conspiracy (Junior M.A.F.I.A. album)|Conspiracy]]'' (1995).\n\nWhile working on his second album in 1995, he became embroiled in the growing [[East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry|East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud]]. After [[Tupac Shakur]] was [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murdered in a drive-by shooting]] in Las Vegas in September 1996, rumors circulated suggesting that criminal elements connected to the Bad Boy camp might have been involved, given Wallace's public feud with Shakur. In March 1997, six months after Shakur's death, [[Murder of the Notorious B.I.G.|Wallace was also killed in a drive-by shooting]] in [[Los Angeles]] by an unknown assailant. Two weeks later, his second album, ''[[Life After Death]]'' (1997), was issued as a posthumous double album; it debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], yielded two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-number one singles: \"[[Hypnotize (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Hypnotize]]\" and \"[[Mo Money Mo Problems]]\" (featuring Puff Daddy and [[Mase]]), and received [[RIAA certification|diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nWith two posthumous albums released, Wallace's certified U.S. sales exceed 28{{nbsp}}million copies, including 21{{nbsp}}million albums. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called him the \"greatest rapper that ever lived\", and, in 2015, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named him the [[Billboard and Vibe's 50 Greatest Rappers of All Time|greatest rapper of all time]]. [[The Source (magazine)|''The Source'']] magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, [[MTV]] ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly \"the most skillful ever on the mic\". In 2020, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].",
