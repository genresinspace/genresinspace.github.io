  "description": "'''Los Plebes del Rancho de Ariel Camacho''' are a [[regional Mexican]] band, specializing in the sierreño-banda style (also known as [[Sierreño|sierreño with tuba]]). The group was founded in 2013 as '''Ariel Camacho y Los Plebes del Rancho''', by Mexican musician [[Ariel Camacho]] and his friend César Sánchez and were originally signed to JG Entertainment. They signed with [[DEL Records]] in 2014, but then left in 2016 due to disputes with the label's owner. The death of Ariel Camacho caused changes to the group.\n\nThe band consists of a [[twelve-string guitar]], a [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|six-string acoustic guitar]], and a [[Sousaphone|sousaphone tuba]]. This style of regional Mexican music is a hybrid of [[Sinaloa]]-style [[sierreño]] and [[Banda (music)|banda]].\n\nLos Plebes del Rancho are credited with turning their style of music, which had previously been an obscure genre from the sierras (mountain ranges) of Northwestern Mexico, into a mainstream genre popular across Mexico and the Mexican-American community of the [[United States]].",
