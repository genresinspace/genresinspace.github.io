In November 2019, the band announced that it would reunite to embark on a 2020 UK and European tour, but it was postponed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Touring was due to recommence with 2021–2022 dates, but the tour was cancelled with Patton citing mental health reasons, and the band has no current plans to resume activity.",
