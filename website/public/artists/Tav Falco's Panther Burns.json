  "description": "'''Tav Falco's Panther Burns''', sometimes shortened to '''(The) Panther Burns''', is a rock band originally from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], [[United States]], led by [[Tav Falco]]. They are best known for having been part of a set of bands emerging in the late 1970s and early 1980s who helped nationally popularise the blending of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], and other American [[traditional music]] styles with rock music among groups playing in [[alternative rock|alternative music]] and [[punk music]] venues of the time. The earliest and most renowned of these groups to imbue these styles with [[Expressionism|expressionist]] theatricality and primitive spontaneity were [[The Cramps]], largely influenced by [[rockabilly]] music. Forming just after them in 1979, Panther Burns drew on obscure [[country blues]] music, [[Antonin Artaud]]'s works like ''The Theatre and Its Double'', [[beat poetry]], and [[Marshall McLuhan|Marshall McLuhan's]] media theories for their early inspiration. Alongside groups like The Cramps and [[The Gun Club (band)|The Gun Club]], Panther Burns is also considered a representative of the [[Gothic country|Southern Gothic-tinged roots music revival scene]].\n\nAfter forming Tav Falco's Panther Burns and making their first recordings in Memphis, the group soon evolved as a rotating crew of additional musicians hailing mostly from Memphis, [[New York City|New York]], and [[New Orleans]]. Falco moved [[Paris, France|Paris]] and later to [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]], at which time he began working more with European musicians.",
