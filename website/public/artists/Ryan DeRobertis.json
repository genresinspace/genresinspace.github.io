  "description": "'''Ryan DeRobertis''' (known by his stage names '''Skylar Spence''' and '''SAINT PEPSI''') is an American [[electronic musician]] and singer who grew up in [[Farmingville, New York]] and attended [[Boston College]] for two years studying music. His [[electronic music]] project SAINT PEPSI began in December 2012. After the release of his ninth studio album ''Hit Vibes'' in May 2013, he would retire the SAINT PEPSI name due to legal threats from the soft-drink company [[PepsiCo]]. He would adopt the name Skylar Spence in 2015, and release his debut record under that moniker, ''[[Prom King (album)|Prom King]]''. In 2019, he would return under the name SAINT PEPSI with the release of ''Mannequin Challenge'', and he currently uses that name for live performances and certain releases.",
