  "description": "'''François Luambo Luanzo Makiadi''' (6 July 1938 – 12 October 1989) was a Congolese singer, guitarist, songwriter, bandleader, and cultural revolutionary. He was a central figure in 20th-century [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] and [[African music]], principally as the bandleader for over 20 years of [[TPOK Jazz]], the most popular and influential African band of its time and arguably of all time. He is referred to as '''Franco Luambo''' or simply '''Franco'''. Known for his mastery of [[Congolese rumba]], he was nicknamed by fans and critics \"Sorcerer of the Guitar\" and the \"Grand Maître of Zairean Music\", as well as '''Franco de Mi Amor''' by female [[fandom]]. [[AllMusic]] described him as perhaps the \"big man in African music\". His extensive musical repertoire was a social commentary on love, [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]], marriage, [[decorum]], [[politics]], [[Rivalry|rivalries]], [[mysticism]], and [[commercialism]]. In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him at number 71 on its list of the 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.\n\nBorn in Sona-Bata in [[Kongo Central]] and raised in [[Kinshasa]], Franco was mentored in his youth by Congolese musicians Paul Ebengo Dewayon and Albert Luampasi, who helped introduce him to the music industry. He initially performed with Luampasi's band, Bandidu, alongside Dewayon, and later worked with Dewayon's band Watam, under the auspices of the [[Loningisa]] label, managed by Greek music executive Basile Papadimitriou. After a successful audition for producer [[Henri Bowane]], Franco was signed to a long-term contract by Loningisa.{{rp|54}} In 1954, he joined LOPADI (''Loningisa de Papadimitriou''), during which period Bowane coined the moniker \"Franco\".\n\nFranco co-founded OK Jazz in 1956, which emerged as a defining force in [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] and [[African popular music]]. As the lead guitarist, Franco developed a distinctive style characterized by [[Polyrhythm|polyrhythmic]] sophistication and intricate [[Classical guitar with additional strings|multi-string]] plucking, laying the foundation for what became known as the \"[[Congolese rumba#Schools of Congolese rumba|OK Jazz School]]\".{{rp|188}} His innovative approach to the [[sebene]]—the instrumental section of Congolese rumba—placed it at the [[Conclusion (music)|song's climax]] and infused it with a syncopated thumb-and-forefinger plucking technique, revolutionizing the genre. This style became central to the band's sound and was deeply rooted in ''rumba odemba'', a rhythmic and melodic tradition emanating from the [[Mongo people]] of [[Mbandaka]]. His early recordings in the 1950s—including Congolese rumba landmarks such as \"Bato Ya Mabe Batondi Mboka\", \"Joséphine Naboyi Ye\", and \"Da Da De Tu Amor\", as well as [[Upbeat (music)|upbeat]] [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|cha-cha-chá]] hits like \"Linda Linda\", \"Maria Valenta\", and \"Alliance Mode Succès\"—helped define the Congolese rumba's sound across [[Central Africa|Central]], [[East Africa|Eastern]], and parts of [[West Africa|Western Africa]]. Franco's breakout song, \"On Entre O.K., On Sort K.O.\", released in December 1956, achieved widespread acclaim and became the band's emblematic motto.\n\nIn 1967, he became the band's co-leader alongside vocalist [[Vicky Longomba]], and when Vicky departed in 1970, Franco assumed full leadership. The following year, the band was rebranded as ''Tout-Puissant Orchestre Kinois de Jazz'' (TPOK Jazz), meaning \"The Almighty Kinshasa Jazz Orchestra\". Throughout the 1970s, Luambo became increasingly engaged in the political sphere, aligning himself with President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s state ideology of ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|Authenticité]]''. He wrote numerous songs extolling Mobutu and his administration. By the early 1980s, a significant number of TPOK Jazz members had relocated to Europe, seeking refuge from the worsening socio-economic conditions in Kinshasa. Despite this geographic shift, the band remained remarkably productive, releasing a series of popular hits, including \"12 600 Lettres\" (1981), \"Lettre à Mr. Le Directeur Général\" (1983)—a collaboration with [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]] and his Orchestre Afrisa International—and \"Non\" (1983). The Franco-[[Madilu System|Madilu]] duo yielded some of his most enduring classics: \"Mamou\" (alternately known as \"Tu Vois\", 1984), \"[[Mario (song)|Mario]]\" (1985), \"La Vie des Hommes\" (1986), and \"Batela Makila Na Ngai\" (also known as \"Sadou\", 1988). \n\nIn recognition of his profound impact on the musical and cultural heritage of [[Zaire]], Franco was named an [[National Order of the Leopard#Notable recipients|Officer]] of the [[National Order of the Leopard]] in 1976 and was awarded the Maracas d'Or in 1982 for his influence on [[Francophonie|Francophone]] music. Though twice married, Franco's personal life was often marred by well-known infidelities. In his final years, rapid weight loss and persistent rumors of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] overshadowed his career, prompting his 1988 song \"Les Rumeurs (Baiser ya Juda)\" as a direct response. Franco passed away in 1989 at a hospital situated in Mont-Godinne, a town in [[Yvoir]], part of [[Wallonia]]'s [[Namur Province]] in Belgium.",
