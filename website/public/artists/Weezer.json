They have sold 10 million albums in the United States and more than 35 million worldwide.\n\nAfter signing to [[Geffen Records]] in 1993, Weezer released their critically acclaimed self-titled debut album, also known as the [[Weezer (Blue Album)|Blue Album]], in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles \"[[Undone â€“ The Sweater Song]]\", \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", the Blue Album became a [[multi-platinum]] success. Weezer's second album, ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved [[cult following|cult status]] and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and ''Pinkerton'' are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for ''Pinkerton'', founding bassist [[Matt Sharp]] left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with the [[Weezer (Green Album)|Green Album]] with their new bassist, [[Mikey Welsh]]. With a more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented sound, and promoted by singles \"[[Hash Pipe]]\" and \"[[Island in the Sun (Weezer song)|Island in the Sun]]\", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, ''[[Maladroit]]'' (2002), incorporated a [[hard rock]] sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. ''[[Make Believe (Weezer album)|Make Believe]]'' (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"[[Beverly Hills (Weezer song)|Beverly Hills]]\" became Weezer's first single to top the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and their first to reach the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nIn 2008, Weezer released the [[Weezer (Red Album)|Red Album]]; its lead single, \"[[Pork and Beans (song)|Pork and Beans]]\", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a [[Grammy]]-winning music video. ''[[Raditude]]'' (2009) and ''[[Hurley (album)|Hurley]]'' (2010) both featured more modern pop production, along with songs co-written with other artists, receiving further mixed reviews and moderate sales. ''[[Everything Will Be Alright in the End]]'' (2014) and the [[Weezer (White Album)|White Album]] (2016) returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 90s sound, mixed with modern alternative production, and achieved more positive reviews. ''[[Pacific Daydream]]'' (2017) returned to more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the [[Weezer (Teal Album)|Teal Album]], followed by the [[Weezer (Black Album)|Black Album]]. In 2021, they released ''[[OK Human]]'', which featured an [[orchestral pop]] sound and received acclaim, followed by the hard rock-inspired ''[[Van Weezer]]''. In 2022, Weezer released ''SZNZ'' (pronounced \"seasons\"), a series of EPs based on the four seasons.",
