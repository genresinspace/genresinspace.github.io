  "description": "'''The Need''' is an American [[queercore]] band formed by the singer and drummer [[Rachel Carns]] and the guitarist [[Radio Sloan]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], in the mid-1990s.\n\nAfter issuing a series of seven-inches on labels including [[Kill Rock Stars]] and [[Outpunk]], the Need relocated to [[Olympia, Washington]] and released two albums for [[Chainsaw Records]]. The duo's unsettling brand of [[post-punk]] [[art rock]] (combined with Carns' distinctive artwork) would set them apart and ensure their versatility. During the band's initial run, they played shows with such diverse acts as [[Tribe 8]], [[Fugazi]], [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] and [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], and toured with [[Le Tigre]], [[BS 2000]] and [[Blonde Redhead]]. Their third album, ''The Transfused'', acted as a soundtrack to the [[rock opera]] of the same name.\n\nThe Need dissolved in 2001, with Carns and Sloan shifting their focus to other projects. After briefly reuniting for benefit shows in 2010, the Need reformed for a second time in 2013 and released the album ''Resurrection''.",
