  "description": "'''Andrew Carthy''' (born 10 February 1972), known professionally as '''Mr. Scruff''', is an English [[record producer]] and [[DJ]]. He lives in [[Stretford]], [[Greater Manchester]] and studied [[fine art]] at the [[Psalter Lane]] campus of [[Sheffield Hallam University]]. Before he could make a living from his music alone, he worked as a shelf stocker in the [[Hazel Grove]] branch of [[Kwik Save]].\n\nHis stage name was inspired by his scruffy facial hair as well as his trademark loose-lined drawing style. He has been DJing since 1992, at first in and around [[Manchester]], then nationwide. He is known for DJing in marathon sets (often exceeding six hours), his eclectic musical taste, his love of a \"nice cup of tea,\" and the quirky home-produced visuals and animations associated with his music. In an interview, he said, \"It's about putting a lot of effort in and paying attention to detail. I get annoyed if I don't take risks. I'm very hard on myself.\"",
