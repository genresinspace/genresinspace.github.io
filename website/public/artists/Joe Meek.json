  "description": "'''Robert George '''\"'''Joe'''\"''' Meek''' (5 April 1929 â€“ 3 February 1967) was an English record producer and songwriter considered one of the most influential sound engineers of all time, being one of the first to develop ideas such as the [[recording studio as an instrument]], and becoming one of the first producers to be recognised for his [[auteur|individual identity as an artist]]. Meek pioneered [[space age pop|space age]] and [[experimental pop]] music, and assisted in the development of recording practices like [[overdubbing]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[reverberation]].\n\n[[The Tornados]]' instrumental \"[[Telstar (song)|Telstar]]\" (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British [[Rock music|rock]] group to reach number one in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]]. It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for this production as the \"Best-Selling A-Side\" of 1962. Charting singles Meek produced for other artists include \"[[Johnny Remember Me]]\" ([[John Leyton]], 1961), \"[[Just Like Eddie]]\" ([[Heinz Burt|Heinz]], 1963), \"Angela Jones\" ([[Michael Cox (singer)|Michael Cox]], 1960), \"[[Have I the Right?]]\" ([[the Honeycombs]], 1964), and \"[[Tribute to Buddy Holly]]\" ([[Mike Berry (singer)|Mike Berry]], 1961). He also produced music for films such as ''[[Live It Up! (film)|Live It Up!]]'' (US title ''Sing and Swing'', 1963), a pop music film.  Meek's [[concept album]] ''[[I Hear a New World]]'' (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.\n\nMeek was affected by [[bipolar disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]]. His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. On 3 February 1967, using a [[shotgun]] owned by musician [[Heinz Burt]], Meek killed his landlady, Violet Shenton, with whom he had argued over the loudness of his studio, which he rented from her, and then shot himself.\n\nAt the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed \"The Tea Chest Tapes\". His reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the [[Music Producers Guild]] who in 2009 created \"The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production\" as a \"homage to [the] remarkable producer's pioneering spirit\". In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by ''[[NME]]'', elaborating: \"Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today.\"",
