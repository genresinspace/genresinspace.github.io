  "description": "'''The Strokes''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 1998. The band is composed of lead singer and primary songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond, Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. They were a leading group of the early-2000s [[garage rock revival]] and [[post-punk revival]] movements.\n\nThe release of their debut EP ''[[The Modern Age]]'' in early 2001 sparked a [[bidding war]] among minor labels, with the band eventually signing to [[RCA Records]]. That summer, they released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]]'', to widespread critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous \"greatest albums\" lists. It was followed by ''[[Room on Fire]]'' (2003) and ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'' (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match ''Is This It'' in immediate critical success, despite positive reviews nonetheless.\n\nFollowing a five-year hiatus, they released ''[[Angles (The Strokes album)|Angles]]'' (2011) and ''[[Comedown Machine]]'' (2013) to generally positive receptions but dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the ''[[Future Present Past]]'' EP (2016) through Casablancas' label [[Cult Records|Cult]]. The band were relatively inactive throughout the rest of the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.\n\nIn 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, ''[[The New Abnormal]]'', produced by [[Rick Rubin]] and released through Cult and RCA. The album received highly positive reviews and was considered a return to form by critics. It went on to win [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] at the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]].",
