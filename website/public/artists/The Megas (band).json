  "description": "'''The Megas''', sometimes performing as ''The Belmonts'', are a [[Los Angeles]] based independent video game [[Cover version|cover]] band. They are primarily known for their work based on [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' franchise, but from 2016 onwards have also covered tracks from [[Konami]]'s ''[[Castlevania]]'' series. They differentiate themselves from other artists in the scene by adding lyrics and blending original material with the games' melodies. The band gained initial popularity through [[Newgrounds]] and [[MySpace]] in the late 2000s, as well as their live performances at [[MAGfest]], Nerdapalooza, and the [[Video Games Live]] tour. Capcom has occasionally promoted the group, and used their material to market [[Mega Man Universe]] in 2010.",
