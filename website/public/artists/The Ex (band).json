  "description": "'''The Ex''' is an [[underground music|underground]] band from the [[Netherlands]], started in 1979 at the height of the original [[punk rock|punk]] explosion as a [[Dutch Punk |Dutch punk]] band. The Ex originated from the squatting movement in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Wormer]], and was inspired by bands like [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] and [[The Mekons]].\n\nAlthough initially known as an [[anarcho-punk]] band associated with the Dutch post-punk [[Ultra (music)| ultra]] scene, over the decades the Ex's sound has gradually developed into its current form of highly intricate, experimental [[punk rock|punk]]/[[post-punk]]/[[no wave]]-inspired work. This sound includes a combination of diverse genres and styles, such as [[Noise (music)|noise]], [[folk music|folk]], [[world music]] (including folk music from [[Hungary]], [[Turkey]], Ethiopia, Congo, and Eritrea), [[free jazz]], and crossovers between these genres. Other examples of branching out stylistically include the [[improvised music|improvised]] double album ''[[Instant (album)|Instant]]'' and a release under the moniker ''Ex Orkest'', a 20 piece big band assembled for performances at Holland Festival. \"One reason we are hard to describe is that we never had an education at music school, and in that sense we are not influenced by any traditional playing,\" explained Katherina Bornefeld, drummer for the Ex since 1984. The Ex's lyrics consist of straightforward statements about politics and abuses in society. The band enjoys international acclaim for this socially critical message, as well as for the energetic, rhythmic, atonal guitar playing, and for the furious vocals of singer [[G.W. Sok]], who was replaced in recent years by Arnold de Boer of [[:nl:Zea (band)|Zea]]. The Ex have released over 20 full-length albums.",
