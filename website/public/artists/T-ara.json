  "description": "'''T-ara''' ({{IPAc-en|t|i|ˈ|ɑː|r|ə}}; {{langx|ko|티아라}}) is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed in 2009, currently consisting of four members: [[Qri]], [[Hahm Eun-jung|Eunjung]], [[Hyomin]], and [[Park Ji-yeon|Jiyeon]]. T-ara's career is marked by [[Hook (music)|hook-heavy]] [[dance-pop]] music, a result of their close partnership with composer [[Shinsadong Tiger]]. A broad array of visual concepts have earned the group a \"chameleon-like\" reputation.{{efn|\"Girl group T-ara's new song won't be an unusual and comical image but more of a feminine and calm concept. It is different from the image T-ara used to emphasize on so it's awkward but it is a strategy to use an ordinary concept that differentiates them from others. But then again, after T-ara debuted in 2009, they did kitten, robot, Native Americans and many different concepts and choreography.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yu|first1=Jin-hyung|title=[MD인터뷰①] 티아라 \"김광수 사장이 곧 리더, 2번이나 재계약\"|url=http://media.daum.net/m/entertain/newsview/20161105080005337|website=[[Daum (web portal)|Daum]]|publisher=[[Kakao]]|access-date=16 January 2017|archive-date=April 4, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404044124/http://media.daum.net/m/entertain/newsview/20161105080005337|url-status=live}}</ref>}} The group has achieved commercial success in several regions in Asia including South Korea and China, with their single \"[[Roly-Poly (T-ara song)|Roly-Poly]]\" (2011) being one of the [[List of best-selling singles in South Korea|most downloaded domestic singles]] since 2010 and the most downloaded girl group single to date.\n\nT-ara made their debut with the single \"[[Lies (T-ara song)|Lies]]\" in 2009. Their debut studio album ''[[Absolute First Album]]'' (2009) was well received critically and spawned the hit singles \"[[TTL (Time to Love)]]\", \"[[Bo Peep Bo Peep]]\", and \"[[You Drive Me Crazy (T-ara song)|You Drive Me Crazy]]\". Both their debut Japanese single and [[Jewelry Box (T-ara album)|studio album]] reached number one on the [[Oricon]] weekly charts and were subsequently certified gold. They subsequently gained nationwide recognition after releasing \"Roly-Poly\" (2011) which went on to become the [[Gaon Chart|Gaon]] chart's best-selling single of the year. T-ara signed onto Japanese management agency J-Rock for $4.7 million—reportedly the highest figure of any Korean girl group expanding into the territory at the time. T-ara's Korean EP ''[[Black Eyes (EP)|Black Eyes]]'' (2011) spawned three consecutive number ones: \"[[Cry Cry]]\", \"[[We Were in Love (T-ara song)|We Were in Love]]\" and \"[[Lovey-Dovey (T-ara song)|Lovey-Dovey]]\".\n\nIn 2012, T-ara experienced a dip in popularity as the group faced accusations of internal discord, resulting in Hwayoung's immediate departure with Areum following a year after. T-ara's later material was released to varying degrees of success before the group began focusing on promotional activities in China, where they attracted attention for their cover of Chopstick Brothers' \"Little Apple\" (2014). T-ara's final release as six members was tentatively scheduled for May 2017, ahead of [[Park So-yeon (singer)|Soyeon]] and [[Jeon Boram|Boram]]'s expiring contracts; however, conflicts with their management delayed ''[[What's My Name? (EP)|What's My Name?]]'' until June 2017, effectively ending their involvement. After a four-year hiatus, T-ara reunited and released their first independent single album, ''[[Re:T-ara]]'', in 2021. T-ara has sold 1.14 million physical albums as of December 2020 and over 34 million digital singles, making them among the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] in total record sales.",
