He composed works for [[Machito]] (''Afro-Cuban suite'' with [[Charlie Parker]], 1950) and [[Benny Goodman]]'s Bebop Orchestra (\"Undercurrent Blues\"), and arranged for [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Stan Kenton]], among others.\n\nIn the 1990s, O'Farrill led a big band that took up residence at New York's [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] nightclub. Chico's son, pianist [[Arturo O'Farrill]], eventually took over the band.",
