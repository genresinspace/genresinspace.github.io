  "name": "The Groundhogs",
  "description": "'''The Groundhogs''' were an English [[British blues|blues]] and [[rock music|rock]] band founded in late 1963 in [[London]]. Named after [[John Lee Hooker]]'s song \"Ground Hog Blues\", they were part of the burgeoning [[British rhythm and blues]] scene, backing Hooker on his album ''[[...And Seven Nights]]''. They were predominantly a [[power trio]] of [[Tony McPhee]] (singer, guitarist, song-writer), Peter Cruickshank (bass) and Ken Pustelnik (drums), with [[Clive Brooks]] replacing Pustelnik in 1972 until the band split in 1974. They issued seven albums via [[Liberty Records|Liberty]]/[[United Artists Records|UA]], including the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]] Top 10 ''[[Thank Christ for the Bomb]]'' (1970, #9), ''[[Split (Groundhogs album)|Split]]'' (1971, #5) and ''[[Who Will Save the World?]]'' (1972, #8).\n\nMcPhee resurrected the name with a different rhythm section in 1975 for two more studio albums, and again in 1982 to 2003 for a further two studio albums. A re-union of the early 1970s trio in 2003 ended McPhee's run, with Cruickshank and Pustelnik continuing as The Groundhogs Rhythm Section.\n\nMcPhee resurrected the name again in 2007 through to 2014, although only for live performances.",
