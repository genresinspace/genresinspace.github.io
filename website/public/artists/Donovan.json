  "description": "'''Donovan Phillips Leitch''' (born 10 May 1946), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Donovan''', is a Scottish musician, songwriter and record producer. He emerged from the [[British folk]] scene in early 1965 and subsequently scored multiple international hit singles and albums during the late 1960s. [[Donovan discography|His work]] became emblematic of the [[flower power]] era with its blend of [[Folk music|folk]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[jazz]] stylings.\n\nDonovan first achieved recognition with live performances on the pop TV series ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' in 1965. Having signed with [[Pye Records]] that year, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein for [[Hickory Records]], scoring three UK hit [[Single (music)|singles]]: \"[[Catch the Wind]]\", \"[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]\" and \"[[Universal Soldier (song)|Universal Soldier]]\", the last written by [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]]. He then signed to [[Epic Records|CBS/Epic]] in the US and became more successful internationally, beginning a long collaboration with British record producer [[Mickie Most]].  In September 1966, \"[[Sunshine Superman (song)|Sunshine Superman]]\" topped America's [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for one week and went to No.&nbsp;2 in Britain, followed by \"[[Mellow Yellow]]\" at US No.&nbsp;2 in December 1966, then 1968's \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\" in the top 5 in both countries and then \"[[Atlantis (Donovan song)|Atlantis]]\", which reached US No.&nbsp;7 in May 1969. The compilation ''[[Donovan's Greatest Hits]]'' was released in March 1969 and peaked at No. 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nDonovan became a friend of other prominent musicians such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Brian Jones]] and [[the Beatles]]. He taught [[John Lennon]] a [[finger-picking]] guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in \"[[Dear Prudence]]\", \"[[Julia (Beatles song)|Julia]]\", \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" and other songs. His backing musicians included the [[Jeff Beck Group]] and [[John Bonham]], [[Jimmy Page]] and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who later rose to fame as members of [[Led Zeppelin]]. Donovan's commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time.\n\nDonovan continued to perform and record intermittently in the 1970s and 1980s. His musical style and [[hippies|hippie]] image were scorned by critics, especially after the rise of [[punk rock]]. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain's [[rave music|rave]] scene and in 1994, he moved permanently to Ireland where he still lives. In 1996 he recorded the album ''[[Sutras (album)|Sutras]]'' with producer [[Rick Rubin]] and in 2004 made the album ''[[Beat Cafe]]''. Donovan was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2012 and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2014.",
