  "description": "'''Icepick''' is an American [[metalcore]] band formed in 1996. It serves as a side project to [[Jamey Jasta]] of [[Hatebreed]], [[Danny Diablo]], and other musicians of the [[hardcore punk]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] scenes. Although founded in 1996, Icepick remained virtually stagnant until the song \"Born to Crush You\" appeared on ''UFC: Ultimate Beat Downs, Vol. 1'' in August 2004. Former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] heavyweight champion [[Andrei Arlovski]] frequently uses their song \"Onward to Victory\" as his entrance music for fights.\n\nIcepick's debut album, ''Violent Epiphany'', was released on April 18, 2006, under Jasta's record label, [[Stillborn Records]]. It features guest vocals by musicians including [[Ice-T]], [[Roger Miret]], [[Freddy Cricien]], [[Al Barr]], Paul Bearer of [[Sheer Terror]], and Pete Morcey of [[100 Demons]]. Wrote [[Allmusic]], the album \"is exactly what you'd expect from a Jasta-Ezec union -- spit-flying, angsty hollering and riffs that alternate between ragingly fast and grindingly slow.\"",
