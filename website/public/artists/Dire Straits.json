The band was active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.\n\nTheir first single, \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\", from their 1978 [[Dire Straits (album)|self-titled debut album]], reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including \"[[Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits song)|Romeo and Juliet]]\" (1981), \"[[Private Investigations (song)|Private Investigations]]\" (1982), \"[[Twisting by the Pool]]\" (1983), \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\" (1985), and \"[[Walk of Life]]\" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, ''[[Brothers in Arms (album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on CD and is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|eighth-best-selling album]] in UK history. According to the ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums|Guinness Book of British Hit Albums]]'', as of 2005, Dire Straits had spent over 1,100 weeks on the [[UK Albums Chart]], the fifth-most at that time.\n\nDire Straits drew from influences including [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], the [[blues rock]] of [[J. J. Cale]], and [[jazz]]. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with [[punk rock]] and demonstrated a [[roots rock]] influence that emerged from [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]]. The band experienced several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its entire history. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'': \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\" They regrouped in 1990 and disbanded permanently in June 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has declined numerous reunion offers, and confirmed in April 2024 that he would never play as part of the group again.\n\nDire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine; their [[Brothers in Arms Tour|1985â€“1986 world tour]], which included a performance at [[Live Aid]] in July 1985, set a record in [[Australasia]]. Their [[On Every Street Tour|final world tour]] from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. The band won four [[Grammy Award]]s, three [[Brit Awards]] (including [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]] twice) and two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, among various others. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2018.  Dire Straits have sold between 100 million and 120 million records worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.",
