  "description": "'''Louis Leo Prima''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|i|_|ˈ|p|r|iː|m|ə}}; December 7, 1910 – August 24, 1978) was an American trumpeter, singer, entertainer, and bandleader. While rooted in [[New Orleans]] [[jazz]], [[swing music]], and [[jump blues]], Prima touched on various genres throughout his career: he formed a seven-piece [[Dixieland|New Orleans–style jazz]] band in the late 1920s, fronted a [[swing (genre)|swing]] combo in the 1930s and a [[big band]] group in the 1940s, helped to popularize [[jump blues]] in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s, and performed frequently as a [[Las Vegas Valley|Vegas]] [[lounge music|lounge act]] beginning in the 1950s.\n\nFrom the 1940s through the 1960s, his music further encompassed early [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[rock 'n' roll]], [[boogie-woogie]], and [[Italian folk music]], such as the [[tarantella]]. Prima made prominent use of Italian music and [[Italian language|language]] in his songs, blending elements of his [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Sicilians|Sicilian]] identity with jazz and swing music. At a time when ethnic musicians were discouraged from openly stressing their ethnicity, Prima's conspicuous embrace of his Sicilian ethnicity opened the doors for other Italian-American and ethnic American musicians to display their ethnic roots.\n\nPrima is also known for providing the voice for the [[orangutan]] [[King Louie]] in the 1967 [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.",
