  "description": "'''The 5th Dimension''' is an American vocal group. Their music encompasses sunshine pop, pop soul, and psychedelic soul. They were an important [[crossover music]] act of the 1960s and 1970s, although both praised and derided for their particular musical approach and mass appeal. During the original group's heyday, they were twice invited to perform at the [[White House]], and accepting those invitations was controversial during that era of social upheaval.\n\nFormed as '''The Versatiles''' in late 1965, the group changed its name to \"The 5th Dimension\" by 1966. Between 1967 and 1973, they charted with 20 [[Top 40]] hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], two of which – \"[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up and Away]]\" (No. 7, 1967) and the 1969 No. 1 \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Medley: Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In (The Flesh Failures)]]\"—won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. Other big hits include \"[[Stoned Soul Picnic (song)|Stoned Soul Picnic]]\" (No. 3), \"[[Wedding Bell Blues]]\" (No. 1), \"[[One Less Bell to Answer]]\" (No. 2), a cover of \"[[Never My Love]]\" (Pop chart, No. 12/[[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] No. 1), \"[[(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All]]\" (No. 8), and \"[[If I Could Reach You (song)|If I Could Reach You]]\" (Pop chart No. 10/[[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] No. 1). Three of their records reached the Top Ten of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Rhythm & Blues/Soul]] chart. Five of their 19 \"Top 20\" hits on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart reached the No. 1 position.\n\nThe five original members were [[Lamonte McLemore]], [[Marilyn McCoo]], [[Florence LaRue]], [[Ronald Townson]], and [[Billy Davis Jr.]] Their earliest recordings were on the [[Soul City Records (U.S. label)|Soul City]] record label, which was started by recording artist [[Johnny Rivers]]. The group later recorded for [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell]]/[[Arista Records]], [[ABC Records]], and [[Motown Records]].",
