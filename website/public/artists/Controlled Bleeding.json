  "name": "Controlled Bleeding",
  "description": "'''Controlled Bleeding''' was an [[Experimental music|experimental]] music group based in [[Massapequa, New York]]. The group was founded by Paul Lemos, the group's only consistent member. Most of Controlled Bleeding's released recordings feature two main collaborators, Chris Moriarty and vocalist Joe Papa, who both died in the late 2000s. In February 2020 Lemos announced that the band had dissolved.\n\nSince their first full-length release in 1983, Controlled Bleeding released over 30 albums spanning several different genres, many of which were released on notable independent labels. Their cross-genre approach combined with the out-of-print status of many of the group's releases is reminiscent of the work of other experimental and cross-genre groups of the 80s and 90s such as [[Coil (band)|Coil]] and [[Swans (band)|Swans]].",
