He first signed with local underground record label [[Awful Records]] in 2014, and later signed with [[ASAP Mob]]'s record label AWGE, in a joint venture with [[Interscope Records]] two years later.  Carter gained mainstream attention following the release of his [[Playboi Carti (mixtape)|eponymous debut mixtape]] (2017), which peaked at number 12 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-charting singles \"[[Magnolia (Playboi Carti song)|Magnolia]]\" and \"[[Wokeuplikethis]]\" (featuring [[Lil Uzi Vert]]).\n\nCarter's debut studio album ''[[Die Lit]]'' (2018) saw further commercial success, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200. Following a two-year hiatus, his second studio album, ''[[Whole Lotta Red]]'' (2020) debuted atop the chart and was met with positive reviews; it was listed as among the best albums of that year by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', with ''Rolling Stone'' ranking it on their list of the \"200 Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of All Time\". He guest performed on [[¥$]]'s 2024 single, \"[[Carnival (¥$ song)|Carnival]]\", which became his first song to peak atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.
