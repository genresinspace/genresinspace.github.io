Known for his eccentric vocal style and fashion, he is considered an influential figure in modern [[hip-hop]] and a pioneer of the [[Rage (music genre)|rage]] microgenre. His music has been characterized as atmospheric and avant-garde, often marked by unconventional vocal techniques such as his \"baby voice\", with critics highlighting his focus on mood and persona over traditional lyricism.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, Carter began his musical career under the stage name '''Sir Cartier''' in 2011, [[self-releasing]] early tracks on [[SoundCloud]]. He signed with [[Awful Records]] in 2014 and later with [[ASAP Rocky]]'s AWGE imprint, a joint venture with [[Interscope Records]], in 2016. Carter gained mainstream attention with his [[Playboi Carti (mixtape)|eponymous debut mixtape]] (2017), which peaked at number 12 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and produced the singles \"[[Magnolia (Playboi Carti song)|Magnolia]]\" and \"[[Wokeuplikethis]]\" (featuring [[Lil Uzi Vert]]). His debut studio album, ''[[Die Lit]]'' (2018), was met with commercial success, debuting at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200.\n\nHis second album, ''[[Whole Lotta Red]]'' (2020), became his first number-one album on the ''Billboard'' 200 and was later ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. After a series of high-profile collaborations, including [[Travis Scott]]'s \"[[Fein (song)|Fein]]\" (2024) and [[Kanye West]] and [[Ty Dolla Sign]]'s \"[[Carnival (¥$ song)|Carnival]]\" (2024)—the latter becoming his first number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]—Carter released his third album, ''[[Music (Playboi Carti album)|Music]]'' (2025). The album received generally positive reviews and became his second consecutive number-one on the ''Billboard'' 200. It yielded the [[Promotional recording|promotional single]], \"[[Evil J0rdan]]\", which debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\nAside from his recording career, Carter founded the record label and rap collective [[Opium (record label)|Opium]] in 2019, which has signed artists including [[Ken Carson]], [[Destroy Lonely]], [[Homixide Gang]], and fellow [[ASAP Mob]] member [[ASAP Nast]].",
