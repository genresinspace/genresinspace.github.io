  "description": "'''Beherit''' is a Finnish [[black metal]] band from [[Rovaniemi]]. The band was formed in 1989 by Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance (Marko Laiho), Demonic Fornication (Jari Vaarala) and Sodomatic Slaughter (Jari Pirinen), with the purpose of performing \"the most primitive, savage, hell-obsessed black metal imaginable\". \"Beherit\" is claimed to be the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word for [[Satan]]. Through the uncommercial nature of their music, visuals, and live performances, the band quickly attracted a [[cult following]]. Besides the \"raw\" sound, the band's music is noted for its [[avant-garde]] side and emphasis on atmosphere. Beherit are now regarded as a pioneer in their genre.\n\nAs a full band, Beherit released one full-length album and many demos and compilations of raw and minimalistic black metal. They disbanded soon after the release of the experimental 1993 album ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (Beherit album)|Drawing Down the Moon]]'', which is now considered a classic of the genre. Laiho, the group's frontman, continued as a solo project and released two more albums under the band's name, ''[[H418ov21.C]]'' in 1994 and ''[[Electric Doom Synthesis]]'' in 1995. These albums are usually categorized as [[dark ambient]]. Although they were completely electronic, the albums carried the atmosphere of the band's black metal recordings. Original members Nuclear Holocausto and Sodomatic Slaughter reformed the band in 2008, now a four-piece featuring new members Ancient Corpse Desekrator and Abyss.",
