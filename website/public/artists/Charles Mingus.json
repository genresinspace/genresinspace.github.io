  "description": "'''Charles Mingus Jr.''' (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American [[jazz]] [[Double bass|upright bassist]], [[composer]], [[bandleader]], [[pianist]], and [[author]]. A major proponent of collective [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], he is considered one of the greatest jazz musicians and composers in history, with a career spanning three decades and collaborations with other jazz greats such as [[Duke Ellington]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Eric Dolphy]]. Mingus's work ranged from advanced [[bebop]] and [[avant-garde jazz]] with small and midsize [[jazz ensemble|ensembles]] to pioneering the [[post-bop]] style on seminal recordings like ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'' (1956) and ''[[Mingus Ah Um]]'' (1959) and [[progressive big band]] experiments such as ''[[The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady]]'' (1963).\n\nMingus's compositions continue to be played by contemporary musicians ranging from the repertory bands [[Mingus Big Band]], [[Mingus Dynasty (band)|Mingus Dynasty]], and Mingus Orchestra to high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition. In 1993, the [[Library of Congress]] acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what it called \"the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history\".",
