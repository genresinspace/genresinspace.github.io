Their song \"[[Tha Crossroads]]\", a tribute to their recently deceased mentor Eazy-E, earned them a [[Grammy Award]] in 1997. The group's third album, ''[[The Art of War (Bone Thugs-n-Harmony album)|The Art of War]]'', was released in 1997. In 2000, their album ''[[BTNHResurrection]]'' achieved [[platinum disc|platinum]] status in the United States within a month of its release, whereas their 2002 album, ''[[Thug World Order]]'', saw more moderate success, attaining platinum certification and peaking at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart.

He too rejoined the group shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the same month, BTNH signed a new deal with eOne Music (formerly known as [[Koch Records]]), with whom they had previously collaborated for the release of ''[[Thug Stories]]'' in 2006.",
