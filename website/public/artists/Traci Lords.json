  "description": "'''Traci Elizabeth Lords''' (born '''Nora Louise Kuzma'''; May 7, 1968) is an American actress and singer. As a 15-year-old high-school dropout, she used [[Identity document forgery|fake identity documents]] to enter the [[sex industry]], where she began appearing in [[Pornographic magazine|pornographic magazines]] and [[pornographic film|film]]s. The September 1984 edition of ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' featured her as its [[centerfold]], and she went on to become one of the most sought-after [[Pornographic film actor|pornographic actresses]] of the mid-1980s, appearing in an estimated 75 adult films and videos. In 1986, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) received an anonymous tip that she had been a minor during her time in the industry. All pornographic material featuring Lords—except her last film, ''[[Traci, I Love You]],'' which had been shot two days after her 18th birthday—was removed from distribution in the United States as [[child pornography]]. Efforts to prosecute two producers and her former talent agent failed as Lords had used a stolen birth certificate to obtain a federal passport and California driver's license, thereby giving industry personnel a reasonable belief that she was over 18 at the time. \n\nLords subsequently enrolled at the [[Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute|Lee Strasberg Theater Institute]], where she studied [[method acting]] with the intention of becoming a mainstream actress. She made her mainstream screen debut in the 1988 remake of the 1957 [[Roger Corman]] science fiction film ''[[Not of This Earth (1988 film)|Not of This Earth]]''. She played Wanda Woodward in [[John Waters]]' teen comedy, ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990). Her other acting credits include the television series ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''[[Roseanne]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Profiler (TV series)|Profiler]]'', ''[[First Wave (TV series)|First Wave]]'', ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'', ''[[Gilmore Girls]],'' and ''[[Will & Grace]]''. She also appeared in films such as ''[[Skinner (film)|Skinner]]'' (1993)'', [[Virtuosity]]'' (1995), ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'' (1998), ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]'' (2008), and ''[[Excision (film)|Excision]]'' (2012), which earned her a [[Fangoria#Fangoria Chainsaw Awards|Fangoria Chainsaw Award for Best Supporting Actress]] as well as a Fright Meter Award and a CinEuphoria Award.\n\nLords pursued music in addition to her film career. After her song \"Love Never Dies\" was featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Pet Sematary Two]]'' (1992), she was signed to [[Radioactive Records]] and subsequently released her debut studio album, ''[[1000 Fires]]'' (1995), to generally positive reviews. Despite the poor sales of the album, the lead single \"[[Control (Traci Lords song)|Control]]\" had moderate commercial success. It peaked at number two on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart and a remix was included on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1995), which was eventually certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In 2003, Lords published her autobiography, ''[[Traci Lords: Underneath It All]]'', which received positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 31 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].",
