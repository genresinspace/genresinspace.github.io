  "name": "Dallas Green",
  "description": "'''Dallas Michael John Albert Green''' (born September 29, 1980) is a Canadian musician, singer, songwriter and record producer who records under the name '''City and Colour'''. He is also known for his contributions as a singer, rhythm guitarist, songwriter and co-founder of the [[post-hardcore]] band [[Alexisonfire]]. In 2005, he debuted his first full-length album, ''Sometimes'', which achieved platinum certification in 2006. City and Colour began performing in small intimate venues between Alexisonfire tours. The name ''City and Colour'' comes from his own name: ''[[Dallas]]'', a city, and ''[[Green]]'', a colour. His reasoning for the name was that he felt uneasy \"putting the album out under the name Dallas Green\".",
