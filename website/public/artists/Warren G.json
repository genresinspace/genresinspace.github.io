  "description": "'''Warren Griffin III''' (born November 10, 1970), known professionally as '''Warren G,''' is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, and DJ who helped popularize [[West Coast hip hop]] during the 1990s. A pioneer of [[G-funk]], he attained mainstream success with his 1994 single \"[[Regulate (song)|Regulate]]\" (featuring [[Nate Dogg]]). He is credited with discovering [[Snoop Dogg]], having introduced the then-unknown rapper to record producer [[Dr. Dre]].\n\nHis debut studio album, ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]'' (1994), debuted at number two on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 176,000 in its first week. The album has since received [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), signifying sales of three million copies. \"Regulate\" spent 18 weeks within the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, with three weeks at number two, while its follow-up, \"[[This D.J.]]\", peaked at number nine. At the [[37th Annual Grammy Awards]], both songs received nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]], respectively.\n\nThree songs from his second album, ''[[Take a Look Over Your Shoulder]]'' (1997), peaked within the top 40, as did his 1998 duet with Nate Dogg, \"[[Nobody Does It Better (Nate Dogg song)|Nobody Does It Better]]\". Both the album and its follow-up, ''[[I Want It All (album)|I Want It All]]'' (1999), received gold certifications by the RIAA. His fourth album, ''[[The Return of the Regulator]]'' (2001), failed to yield his earlier commercial heights. Along with longtime collaborators Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, he formed the hip-hop trio [[213 (group)|213]], named for [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]'s area code; they released the album ''[[The Hard Way (213 album)|The Hard Way]]'' (2004) to mild success. \n\nHis next two albums, 2005's ''[[In the Mid-Nite Hour]]'' and then 2009's ''[[The G Files]]'', were released independently and self-produced. In 2015, he released ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era, Part II]]'', an [[extended play]] featuring archived recordings of Nate Dogg, who died in 2011. In 2017, \"Regulate\", certified platinum in 1994, went multi-platinum, propelled by digital downloads.",
