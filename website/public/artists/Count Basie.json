  "description": "'''William James''' \"'''Count'''\" '''Basie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|s|i}}; August 21, 1904&nbsp;– April 26, 1984) was an American [[jazz]] pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935, he formed the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], and in 1936 took them to [[Chicago]] for a long engagement and their first recording. He led the group for almost 50 years, creating innovations like the use of two \"split\" tenor saxophones, emphasizing the rhythm section, [[riff]]ing with a [[big band]], using [[arranger]]s to broaden their sound, his minimalist piano style, and others.\n\nMany musicians came to prominence under his direction, including the tenor saxophonists [[Lester Young]] and [[Herschel Evans]], the guitarist [[Freddie Green]], trumpeters [[Buck Clayton]] and [[Harry \"Sweets\" Edison]], plunger trombonist [[Al Grey]], and singers [[Jimmy Rushing]], [[Helen Humes]], [[Dennis Rowland]], [[Thelma Carpenter]], and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]].\n\nAs a composer, Basie is known for writing such [[jazz standard]]s as \"[[Blue and Sentimental]]\", \"[[Jumpin' at the Woodside]]\" and \"[[One O'Clock Jump]]\".",
