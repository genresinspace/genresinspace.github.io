  "description": "'''Mark Edward Kozelek''' (born January 24, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, record producer and occasional actor. He is the vocalist and primary recording artist of the [[indie folk]] act [[Sun Kil Moon]] and was a founding member of the [[indie rock]] band [[Red House Painters]], with whom he recorded six studio albums from 1988 until 2001.\n\nUpon meeting drummer Anthony Koutsos in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the pair moved to [[San Francisco, California]] and formed Red House Painters alongside guitarist Gorden Mack and bass guitarist Jerry Vessel. Signing with record label [[4AD]], the band released four studio albums. In 1996, Kozelek recorded the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Songs for a Blue Guitar]]'', mostly alone. The release of the band's final studio album, ''[[Old Ramon]]'' (2001), was delayed for three years. In the interim, Kozelek recorded both an album and an EP of [[AC/DC]] cover songs.\n\nReconvening with Koutsos and Vessel, the trio continued performing under the new name of Sun Kil Moon, releasing their debut album, ''[[Ghosts of the Great Highway]]'', in 2003. Inspired by classical guitar music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon's fourth studio album, ''[[Admiral Fell Promises]]'' (2010), as a solo act and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, ''[[Among the Leaves]]'' (2012), and later ''[[Perils from the Sea]]'' and ''[[Mark Kozelek & Desertshore]]'', both released in 2013. In 2014, Sun Kil Moon's sixth studio album, ''[[Benji (album)|Benji]]'', was released to widespread critical acclaim, and increased exposure with its follow-up, 2015's ''[[Universal Themes]]'', featuring lengthy compositions and [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] lyrics.\n\nAcross his work in Sun Kil Moon, Red House Painters, and his own solo material, Kozelek has released 31 studio albums, with his most recent being ''[[All the Best, Isaac Hayes]]'' (2020). A number of commentators have described Kozelek as one of the greatest songwriters of his generation.",
