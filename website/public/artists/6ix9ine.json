  "description": "'''Daniel Hernandez''' (born May 8, 1996), known professionally as '''6ix9ine''' (pronounced \"six nine\"), '''Tekashi69''', or '''Tekashi 6ix9ine''' is an American rapper. His music has been marked by an aggressive style of rapping, while his controversial public persona is characterized by his distinctive rainbow-colored hair, tattoos, legal issues, social media \"[[Troll (slang)|trolling]]\", and publicized celebrity [[feud]]s.\n\nHernandez first became known for his guest performance on [[Trippie Redd]]'s 2017 single \"[[Poles 1469]]\", followed by the release of his debut single, \"[[Gummo (song)|Gummo]]\" that same year, which was a [[sleeper hit]], peaking at number 12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The latter preceded his debut [[mixtape]] ''[[Day69]]'' (2018), which was further supported by the singles \"[[Kooda]]\", \"[[Keke (song)|Keke]]\" (with [[Fetty Wap]] and [[A Boogie wit da Hoodie]]), and \"[[Gotti (song)|Gotti]]\", all of which entered the Hot 100. \"[[Fefe (song)|Fefe]]\" (featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]]), the second single from his debut album ''[[Dummy Boy]]'' (2018), peaked at number three on the chart. Despite negative critical reception, ''Dummy Boy'' peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nIn 2015, Hernandez [[pleaded guilty]] to a [[felony]] count of [[Child pornography|use of a child in a sexual performance]] and was sentenced to a four-year [[probation]] period and a 1,000-hour community service order. In 2018, Hernandez, his manager [[Shotti|Kifano \"Shotti\" Jordan]], and 10 other members of the [[Nine Trey Gangsters]] faction of the [[United Blood Nation]] street gang were [[Trial of the Nine Trey Gangsters|arrested and charged with racketeering]] and various felony crimes. Hernandez received a 2-year prison sentence in December 2019 after [[Turn state's evidence|turning state's evidence]] against the gang and its members. In April 2020, he was put on house arrest for the remainder of his sentence and was released that August.\n\nHernandez briefly maintained commercial success following his release, with his 2020 singles \"[[Gooba]]\" and \"[[Trollz (song)|Trollz]]\" (with Nicki Minaj) peaking at number three and one on the Hot 100, respectively. His second album, ''[[TattleTales (album)|TattleTales]]'' (2020), debuted at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 and his third album ''[[Leyenda Viva]]'' (2023)—his first [[reggaeton]] album—failed to make any worldwide chart impact. Due to his role as an [[informant]] in the Nine Trey Gangsters trial, several [[hip hop|hip-hop]] figures and outlets condemned or ostracized Hernandez, who argued Hernandez associated with, provided financial compensation to, and committed crimes with gang members solely to gain [[Hip-hop culture#Authenticity|street credibility]] and further his rap career, leading to a decimation of his public image.",
