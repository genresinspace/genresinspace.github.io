  "description": "'''The Dave Clark Five''', also known as the '''DC5''', were an English [[rock and roll]] band formed in 1958 in [[Tottenham]], London. Drummer [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] was the group's leader, producer and co-songwriter. In January 1964, they had their first UK top-ten single, \"[[Glad All Over]]\", which knocked [[the Beatles]]' \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" off the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It peaked at No. 6 in the United States in April 1964. Although this was their only UK No. 1, they topped the US chart in December 1965, with their cover of [[Bobby Day]]'s \"[[Over and Over (Bobby Day song)|Over and Over]]\". Their other UK top-ten hits include \"[[Bits and Pieces (song)|Bits and Pieces]]\", \"[[Can't You See That She's Mine]]\", \"[[Catch Us If You Can]]\", \"[[Everybody Knows (Dave Clark Five song)|Everybody Knows]]\", \"[[Callow-la-vita|The Red Balloon]]\", \"[[Good Old Rock 'n' Roll]]\", and a version of [[Chet Powers]]' \"[[Let's Get Together (Chet Powers song)|Get Together]]\" (retitled as \"Everybody Get Together\").\n\nThey were the second group of the [[British Invasion]] to appear on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the United States (for two weeks in March 1964 following [[The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show|the Beatles' three weeks]] the previous month). They would ultimately have 18 appearances on the show. The DC5 were one of the most commercially successful acts of the British Invasion, releasing seventeen top-40 hits in the US between 1964 and 1967, including several that did not chart as highly in the UK such as \"[[Because (The Dave Clark Five song)|Because]]\", \"[[Do You Love Me]]\", \"Everybody Knows (I Still Love You)\", \"[[Any Way You Want It (Dave Clark Five song)|Any Way You Want It]]\", \"[[I Like It Like That (Chris Kenner song)|I Like It Like That]]\", \"Try Too Hard\" and \"[[You Got What It Takes]]\". In 1965, the group starred in a [[feature film]] vehicle, ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'', directed by [[John Boorman]]. The group disbanded in early 1970, though Clark and a few former members continued as [[Dave Clark & Friends]] until 1973. In 2008, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].",
