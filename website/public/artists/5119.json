  "description": "'''Hasil Adkins''' {{IPAc-en|'|h|æ|s|əl|}} (April 29, 1937 – April 26, 2005) was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His genres include [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], [[blues]] and more commonly [[rockabilly]], and because of his unusual playing and singing style, he is often cited as an example of [[outsider music]]. He generally performed as a [[one-man band]], playing guitar and drums at the same time.\n\nAdkins was born during the [[Great Depression]] and grew up in poverty. His spirited, unusual lifestyle is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for chicken, sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a [[cult following]], spawned the [[Norton Records]] label, and helped usher in the genre known as [[psychobilly]].",
