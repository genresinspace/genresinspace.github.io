His music combines elements of jazz, blues, funk, rock, bluegrass, classical, folk, and flamenco. Shimabukuro has written numerous original compositions, including the entire soundtracks to two Japanese films, ''[[Hula Girls]]'' (2007) and ''[[Sideways (2009 film)|Sideways]]'' (2009), the Japanese remake of the American film of the [[Sideways|same name]].\n\nWell known in Hawaiâ€™i and Japan during his early solo career in the early 2000s, Shimabukuro became famous internationally in 2006, when a video of him playing a virtuosic rendition of \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" was posted on YouTube without his knowledge and became one of the first [[viral video]]s on that site. His concert engagements, collaborations with well-known musicians, media appearances, and music production have snowballed since then. In 2012, an award-winning documentary was released tracking his life, career, and music, titled ''Jake Shimabukuro: Life on Four Strings''; it has screened in a variety of festivals, aired repeatedly on [[PBS]], and been released on DVD.",
