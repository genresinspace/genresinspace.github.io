  "description": "'''No Angels''' are an all-female [[Pop music|pop]] group from Germany, formed in 2000. Originally a quintet, consisting of band members [[Nadja Benaissa]], [[Ludmilla Diakovska|Lucy Diakovska]], [[Sandy MÃ¶lling]], [[Vanessa Petruo]], and [[Jessica Wahls]], they originated on [[Popstars (German season 1)|the debut season]] of [[Popstars (German TV series)|the German adaptation]] of the talent series ''[[Popstars]]'' and were one of the first [[talent show|television-cast act]]s to achieve sustainable success throughout [[Central Europe]] in the early 2000s. Following a major success with record-breaking single \"[[Daylight in Your Eyes]]\" and debut album ''[[Elle'ments]]'' in 2001, a series of hit records established their position as one of the most successful female band vocalists to emerge in the early decade. With four number-one hits, four number-one albums and record sales of more than 5.0 million, they became one of the most successful acts in German music history, winning three [[ECHO (music award)|ECHOs]], a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]], a [[NRJ Music Award]], two [[Comet Award|Comets]], a [[Bambi (prize)|Bambi]] and a [[Goldene Kamera]].\n\nIn fall 2003, the members went their separate ways due to lasting exhaustion, focusing on their individual solo careers in music, theatre, television and film. In 2007, four members of the original line-up re-formed permanently and recorded their first studio album in over four years, ''[[Destiny (No Angels album)|Destiny]]'' (2007). A year after, the group represented [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|Germany]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] in Belgrade, Serbia, where they finished 23rd with their song \"[[Disappear (No Angels song)|Disappear]]\".  A second post-reunion album, titled ''[[Welcome to the Dance]]'' and released in 2009, failed commercially. In September 2010, Benaissa officially left the band due to private reasons, leaving No Angels as a trio before they went into another hiatus. In early 2021, the band reformed as a quartet, commemorating with their 2001 debut. Their sixth studio album ''[[20 (No Angels album)|20]]'', a collection of re-recordings and new songs, was released in June 2021 and became their fourth chart topper.",
