  "description": "'''The Crickets''' were an American [[rock and roll]] band from [[Lubbock, Texas]], formed by singer-songwriter [[Buddy Holly]] in January 1957. Their first hit record, \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", released in May 1957, peaked at number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Top 100]] chart on September 16, 1957. The sleeve of their first album, ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', shows the band line-up at the time: Holly on lead vocals and lead guitar, [[Niki Sullivan]] on rhythm guitar, [[Jerry Allison]] on drums, and [[Joe B. Mauldin]] on bass. The Crickets helped set the template for subsequent rock bands, such as [[the Beatles]], with their guitar-bass-drums line-up, performing their own material. After [[The Day the Music Died|Holly's death in 1959]], the band continued to tour and record into the 1960s and beyond with other band members through to the 21st century.",
