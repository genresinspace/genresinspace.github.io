  "description": "'''The Kovenant''' is a Norwegian [[industrial metal]] band from [[Hamar]]. The band originally formed as a [[symphonic black metal]] act known as '''Covenant''' in 1993, but in 1999 were forced to change their name to The Kovenant due to a dispute with a [[Covenant (band)|Swedish band of the same name]]. The name change also marked a change in sound/style as well, as the band from there on began to focus more on a [[cyber metal|cyber]]/[[industrial metal]] sound heavily influenced by Europe's [[Electronic body music|EBM]] scene. Despite their style change, The Kovenant did later reissue their early albums under The Kovenant name.",
