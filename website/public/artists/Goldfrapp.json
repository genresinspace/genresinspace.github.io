  "description": "'''Goldfrapp''' were an English [[electronic music]] duo from [[London]], formed in 1999. The duo consisted of [[Alison Goldfrapp]] (vocals, [[synthesizer|synthesiser]]) and [[Will Gregory]] (synthesiser).\n\nDespite favourable reviews and a short-listing for the [[Mercury Prize]], their 2000 d√©but studio album ''[[Felt Mountain]]'' did not chart highly. Goldfrapp's second album ''[[Black Cherry (Goldfrapp album)|Black Cherry]]'', which incorporated [[glam rock]] and [[synth-pop]] sounds into their music, was released in 2003. The album's dance-oriented sound was carried over to their third album, ''[[Supernature (Goldfrapp album)|Supernature]]''. ''Supernature'' took Goldfrapp's work further into [[dance music]], and enjoyed international chart success. The album produced three number-one US dance singles, and was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]] at the [[49th Grammy Awards]].\n\nTheir fourth album ''[[Seventh Tree]]'' placed a greater emphasis on ambient and [[downtempo]] music, drawing inspiration from [[nature]] and [[paganism]], while their fifth album, ''[[Head First (Goldfrapp album)|Head First]]'', found the group exploring 1980s-influenced synth-pop. ''Head First'' also earned the duo their second Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2010. Goldfrapp released their critically acclaimed sixth studio album, the [[folktronica]]-influenced ''[[Tales of Us]]'', in September 2013. Goldfrapp released their seventh studio album, ''[[Silver Eye]]'', in March 2017, which debuted at number six on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The same position was achieved by Alison Goldfrapp's May 2023 debut solo album  ''[[The Love Invention]]''.\n\nThe duo has been on indefinite hiatus since 2022.",
