The band was a pivotal influence on the [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[indie rock]] movements.\n\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through releases with [[SST Records]] in the late 1980s, the band experienced mainstream success throughout the 1990s and 2000s after signing to major label [[DGC Records|DGC]] in 1990 and headlining the 1995 [[Lollapalooza]] festival.
