  "description": "'''Samuel John''' \"'''Lightnin''''\" '''Hopkins''' (March 15, 1912 â€“ January 30, 1982) was an American [[country blues]] singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional pianist from [[Centerville, Texas]]. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him No. 71 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nThe [[musicologist]] [[Robert \"Mack\" McCormick]] opined that Hopkins is \"the embodiment of the jazz-and-poetry spirit, representing its ancient form in the single creator whose words and music are one act\".  He influenced [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], and a generation of blues musicians such as [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], whose Grammy-nominated song \"[[Rude Mood]]\" was directly inspired by the Texan's song \"Hopkins' Sky Hop\". In his own lifetime, Hopkins was one of the initial inductees in 1980 to the [[Blues Hall of Fame]].",
