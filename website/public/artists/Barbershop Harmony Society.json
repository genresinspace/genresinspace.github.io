  "description": "The '''Barbershop Harmony Society''', legally and historically named the '''Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, Inc.''' (SPEBSQSA), is the first of several organizations to promote and preserve [[barbershop music]] as an art form. Founded by Owen C. Cash and Rupert I. Hall in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 1938, the organization quickly grew, promoting barbershop harmony among men of all ages. As of 2014, just under 23,000 men in the United States and Canada were members of this organization, whose focus is on [[a cappella]] music. The international headquarters was in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], for fifty years before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 2007. In June 2018, the society announced it would allow women to join as full members.\n\nA parallel women's singing organization, [[Sweet Adelines International]] (SAI), was founded in 1945. A second women's barbershop harmony organization, [[Harmony, Incorporated]], broke from SAI in 1959 over an issue of [[racial segregation|racial exclusion]], with SAI (like SPEBSQSA and many other organizations) being white-only at that time; SPEBSQSA officially lifted the requirement in 1963. Several international affiliate organizations, in countries around the world, add their own flavor to the signature sound of [[barbershop music|barbershop harmony]].\n\nSince November 1941, the organization has published a bi-monthly magazine titled ''The Harmonizer''.",
