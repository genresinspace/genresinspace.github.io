Born in [[Ksar El Kebir]], [[Morocco]], he now lives in [[Rabat]]. His last name is an artist name simply meaning \"from Ksar El Kebir\". He began training at age seven, taught by the [[Tangier]]  Maâlem Abdelouahed Stitou and Maâlem Alouane initially in the special [[Chemeli]] or Northern style of [[Gnawa music]], which is distinctly different from the usual styles of [[Marrakech]]. El Kasri is famed for his deep, intense voice, which has made him one of the most sought-after maâlems, both in Morocco and abroad. In addition to singing, he performs on the ''[[Sintir|guembri]]'' ({{lang|ar|الكمبري}}), a three-stringed bass instrument. He is noted for having blended the Gnawa rhythms of the north and south of the Morocco.",
