Featuring members of [[Los Crudos]], Hail Mary, Devoid of Faith, By the Throat, and Kill the Man Who Questions, the band plays short, fast [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] music, and covers themes concerning the [[gay community]] in their live performances and lyrics. They are an openly gay band and they identify as part of the \"[[queercore]]\" punk subculture.\n The band declared in ''[[Frontiers (magazine)|Frontiers]]'' magazine, \"We put the 'core' back in 'Queercore'\". The band are featured on the cover of ''My Brain Hurts'', [[Liz Baillie]]'s comic about [[queer]] teenagers in New York City.\n\nAfter the break up of [[Los Crudos]], [[Martin Sorrondeguy]], and the original guitarist, Mark Telfian, came up with the idea to form a band. They are an openly gay band and they identify as part of the queercore subculture. They then asked the bassist Andrew Martini, and original drummer, Scott Moore, who were living in Philadelphia to join up for a first practice which was held in Philadelphia in late 1998. After a few weekends of practice, a first gig was set up in Philadelphia at Stalag 13 on June 13, 1999. The members have never all lived in the same city and thus play infrequently, except for an occasional tour.",
