  "description": "'''The Creatures''' were an English band formed in 1981 by vocalist [[Siouxsie Sioux]] and drummer [[Budgie (musician)|Budgie]], both members of the group [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Their music, initially based on drums and voice, evolved over the years. The Creatures released their first [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Wild Things (EP)|Wild Things]]'' in 1981. On their debut album ''[[Feast (The Creatures album)|Feast]]'' (1983) including a UK top 25 single \"[[Miss the Girl]]\", the band embraced [[exotica]] while keeping percussion as the main instrument. On their second album ''[[Boomerang (The Creatures album)|Boomerang]]'' (1989) which was widely critically acclaimed, the duo married their music with blues and jazz; ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine would later rank  ''Boomerang'' at number 184 in their list of \"the 500 Greatest Albums of the 1980s\". In the late 1990s, they developed a more urban sound on ''[[Anima Animus]]''; ''[[The Times]]'' then described their music as \"adventurous art rock built around Siouxsie's extraordinary voice and drummer Budgie's battery of percussion\". For their last album ''[[HÃ¡i!]]'' (2003), they returned to their roots while turning to east, with an ode to Japanese minimalism. They disbanded in 2005.\n\nTheir music was praised by [[Jeff Buckley]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Anohni]], and name-checked by [[Neil Hannon]] of [[The Divine Comedy (band)|the Divine Comedy]].",
