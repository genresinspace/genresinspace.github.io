  "description": "'''The Shapes''' were an English [[punk rock]] group that formed in [[Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]] in 1976.  Different in many ways from their peers in the nascent [[punk subculture]], they were known for eschewing the more political stances that were fashionable at the time, instead producing works of a cartoonish and absurdist nature. They were often compared to [[The Rezillos]] because of their [[Gerry Anderson]]-themed work.",
