  "description": "'''Terius Gray''' (born March 26, 1975), better known by his stage name '''Juvenile''', is an American rapper best known for his work with [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]]'s [[Cash Money Records]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, both solo and as a member of the label's then-flagship group, [[Hot Boys]].\n\nJuvenile's career began in the early 1990s as a teenager with [[bounce music]] recordings that earned him local recognition. After releasing his debut studio album—''Being Myself'' (1995)—to regional success, he signed with Cash Money and saw his mainstream breakthrough with his second and third albums, ''[[Solja Rags]]'' (1997) and ''[[400 Degreez]]'' (1998). The latter peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], received [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and was supported by the singles \"[[Ha (song)|Ha]]\" and \"[[Back That Azz Up]]\" (featuring [[Mannie Fresh]] and [[Lil Wayne]])—his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] entries. He released three subsequent albums—''[[Tha G-Code]]'' (1999), ''[[Project English]]'' (2001) and ''[[Juve the Great]]'' (2003)—for the label to continued success, the latter of which spawned the 2004 single \"[[Slow Motion (Juvenile song)|Slow Motion]]\" (featuring [[Soulja Slim]]), which [[Hot 100 number-one hits of 2004 (USA)|peaked atop]] the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and became his only song to do so.\n\nFollowing his departure from Cash Money, Juvenile briefly signed with [[Atlantic Records]]. His seventh album, ''[[Reality Check (Juvenile album)|Reality Check]]'' (2006) debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200, and was followed by ''[[Cocky & Confident]]'' (2009). He then independently released the albums ''[[Beast Mode (Juvenile album)|Beast Mode]]'' (2010), ''[[Rejuvenation (Juvenile album)|Rejuvenation]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Fundamentals (album)|The Fundamentals]]'' (2014). During his solo work, he formed the hip hop group [[UTP (group)|UTP]] in 2002, with whom he has released two albums; the former of which spawned the 2004 single \"[[Nolia Clap]].\" He returned to Cash Money in 2014.",
