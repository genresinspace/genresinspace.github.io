He first became known for his 2006 song \"Dig Dug (Shake It)\", which became popular in his hometown of [[Germantown, Maryland]] and led Wale to gain further local recognition as he amassed a number of follow-up releases. He signed a recording contract with English DJ-producer [[Mark Ronson]]'s [[Allido Records]] in 2007, which, after a three-label bidding war, entered a joint venture with [[Interscope Records]] for US$1.3 million the following year. During this time, Wale's mixtapes and singles saw national attention as he appeared on [[MTV]] and various Black America-focused magazines.\n\nWale's debut studio album, ''[[Attention Deficit (album)|Attention Deficit]]'' (2009) was under-shipped and thus underperformed commercially, but saw positive critical reception and spawned his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] entry with its [[lead single]], \"[[Chillin (Wale song)|Chillin]]\" (featuring [[Lady Gaga]]). He continued gaining mainstream recognition with his [[guest appearance]] alongside [[Roscoe Dash]] on [[Waka Flocka Flame]]'s 2010 single \"[[No Hands]]\", which peaked at number 13 on the chart and received [[RIAA certification|diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He then signed with Florida-based rapper [[Rick Ross]]' [[Maybach Music Group]], an imprint of [[Warner Records]] the following year to release his second album, ''[[Ambition (Wale album)|Ambition]]'' (2011). Supported by the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated top 40 single \"[[Lotus Flower Bomb]]\" (featuring [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]]), the album saw further critical and commercial success, and peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. His third and fourth albums, ''[[The Gifted (album)|The Gifted]]'' (2013) and ''[[The Album About Nothing]]'' (2015), both debuted atop the chart; the former was led by the single \"[[Bad (Wale song)|Bad]]\" (featuring [[Tiara Thomas]]), which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting entry as a lead artist.\n\nWale shifted for a lighter, commercially-oriented approach with his next three albums: ''[[Shine (Wale album)|Shine]]'' (2017), ''[[Wow... That's Crazy]]'' (2019), and ''[[Folarin II]]'' (2021). They spawned the ''Billboard'' Hot 100-charting singles \"[[My PYT]]\", \"[[On Chill]]\" (featuring [[Jeremih]]), and \"[[Poke It Out]]\" (featuring [[J. Cole]]), respectively. ''Folarin II'' marked his final album with Maybach Music Group, and he signed with [[Def Jam Recordings]] in the following year of its release.",
