She met Spanish [[surrealism|surrealist]] painter [[Salvador Dalí]] and remained his closest friend and [[Muses|muse]] for almost 20 years. Lear first came into the public eye as the cover model for [[Roxy Music]]'s album ''[[For Your Pleasure]]'' in 1973. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, she was a million-album-selling disco star signed to [[Ariola Records]], primarily impacting continental Europe and Scandinavia. Lear's first four albums earned her mainstream popularity, charting in the top 10 of European charts, including the best-selling ''[[Sweet Revenge (Amanda Lear album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1978). Her bigger hits included \"[[Blood and Honey]]\", \"[[Tomorrow (Amanda Lear song)|Tomorrow]]\", \"[[Queen of Chinatown]]\", \"[[Follow Me (Amanda Lear song)|Follow Me]]\", \"[[Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)]]\", \"[[The Sphinx (song)|The Sphinx]]\", and \"[[Fashion Pack]]\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Lear had become a leading media personality in Italy, hosting many popular TV shows. Although television took priority over musical activity, she continued to record, experimenting with different genres and trying to revive her career by re-recording and remixing earlier hits to various levels of success. Lear has also developed a successful career in painting, which she has long described as her biggest passion, and regularly exhibited her works in galleries across Europe and beyond since the early 1980s. She has also written a number of books, including ''[[My Life with Dalí]]''.\n\nSince the 1990s, her time has been divided among music, television, movies and painting. Despite regular album releases, she failed to achieve major success in the charts with her music, but her television career has remained stellar and she has hosted numerous primetime TV shows, mostly in Italy and France, occasionally making guest appearances in TV series. She has performed acting and dubbing roles in independent as well as in major film productions. In the late 2000s, Lear reinvented herself as a theatrical actress, performing in long-running stage plays in France. To date, she allegedly has sold over 27 million records worldwide. Lear is also a widely recognized gay icon.",
