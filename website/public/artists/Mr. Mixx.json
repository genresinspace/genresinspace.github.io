After a slew of successful releases, the group met with considerable controversy as a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida|U.S. district court]] ruled the album legally obscene. They were prosecuted but acquitted.\n\nHobbs produced popular 2 Live Crew singles such as \"Throw the D\", \"[[Me So Horny]]\", \"Hoochie Mama\", and other titles in the group's Miami bass musical catalog.
