  "description": "'''Elizabeth Davidson Fraser''' (born 29 August 1963) is a Scottish singer. She was the vocalist for the band [[Cocteau Twins]], who achieved success in the UK from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Their studio albums ''[[Victorialand]]'' (1986) and ''[[Heaven or Las Vegas]]'' (1990) both reached the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]], while other albums, including ''[[Blue Bell Knoll]]'' (1988), ''[[Four-Calendar Caf√©]]'' (1993), and ''[[Milk & Kisses]]'' (1996), charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts in the United States as well as reaching the top 20 in the UK. She also performed as part of the [[4AD Records|4AD]] group [[This Mortal Coil]], including the successful 1983 single \"[[Song to the Siren#This Mortal Coil version|Song to the Siren]]\", and as a guest with [[Massive Attack]] on their 1998 hit single \"[[Teardrop (song)|Teardrop]]\".\n\nWhen the Cocteau Twins disbanded, Fraser embarked on a moderately low-key solo career and provided guest vocals for other artists. She released some solo material, including the singles \"Underwater\" (2000) and \"Moses\" (2009). Fraser has reportedly{{Citation needed|date=December 2024}} recorded enough material for a debut solo studio album; however, a release date or further information has not been published. In 2022, Fraser released the EP ''Sun's Signature'', which includes a reworked version of her 2000 single \"Underwater\". In May 2022, Fraser and former bandmates Robin Guthrie and Simon Raymonde were awarded the Visionary Award by [[The Ivors Academy]].\n\nHer distinctive style has received much critical praise in her four-decade career; she was described by critic Jason Ankeny as \"an utterly unique performer whose swooping, operatic vocals relied less on any recognisable language than on the subjective sounds and textures of verbalised emotions\".",
