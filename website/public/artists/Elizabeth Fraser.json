  "description": "'''Elizabeth Davidson Fraser''' (born 29 August 1963) is a Scottish singer. She was the vocalist for the band [[Cocteau Twins]], who achieved worldwide success from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. Their studio albums ''[[Victorialand]]'' (1986) and ''[[Heaven or Las Vegas]]'' (1990) reached the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]], while other albums, including ''[[Blue Bell Knoll]]'' (1988), ''[[Four-Calendar Café]]'' (1993), and ''[[Milk & Kisses]]'' (1996), charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album charts in the United States and the top 20 in the UK. She also performed as part of the [[4AD Records|4AD]] group [[This Mortal Coil]], including the successful 1983 single \"[[Song to the Siren#This Mortal Coil version|Song to the Siren]]\", and as a guest with [[Massive Attack]] on several tracks from their 1998 album ''[[Mezzanine (album)|Mezzanine]]'', most notably the commercially successful single \"[[Teardrop (song)|Teardrop]]\", and album tracks \"Black Milk\" and \"Group Four\". She later collaborated with the band again on the track \"Silent Spring\", released on their 2006 compilation ''[[Collected (Massive Attack album)|Collected]]''.\n\nWhen the Cocteau Twins disbanded, Fraser embarked on a solo career and provided guest vocals for other artists. She released some solo material, including the singles \"Underwater\" (2000) and \"Moses\" (2009). In 2022, Fraser released the EP ''Sun's Signature'', which includes a reworked version of her 2000 single \"Underwater\". Her distinctive style has received much critical praise; she was described by critic Jason Ankeny as \"an utterly unique performer whose swooping, operatic vocals relied less on any recognisable language than on the subjective sounds and textures of verbalised emotions\".",
