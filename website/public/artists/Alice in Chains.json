  "description": "'''Alice in Chains''' (often abbreviated as '''AiC''') is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Seattle]] in 1987. Since 2006, the band's lineup has consisted of vocalist/guitarists [[Jerry Cantrell]] and [[William DuVall]], bassist [[Mike Inez]], and drummer [[Sean Kinney]]. Vocalist [[Layne Staley]] and bassist [[Mike Starr (musician)|Mike Starr]] are former members of the band. Often associated with [[grunge]] music, Alice in Chains' sound and style is rooted in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the [[vocal harmony|harmonized]] vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall). They are one of the most popular rock bands from the 1990s.\n\nAlice in Chains' original lineup consisted of Cantrell, Kinney, Staley, and Starr. They rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s. The band broke through on [[MTV]] and [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|mainstream rock radio]] with the single \"[[Man in the Box]]\" (from their 1990 debut album ''[[Facelift (album)|Facelift]]''). After releasing the EP ''[[Sap (EP)|Sap]]'' in early 1992, the band achieved major mainstream and commercial success with their follow-up album ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]'' later that same year. ''Dirt'' contained the popular singles \"[[Rooster (song)|Rooster]]\" and \"[[Would?]]\", among others. Starr was replaced on bass by Inez in early 1993. The following two records, 1994's ''[[Jar of Flies]]'' (which included the popular singles \"[[I Stay Away]]\" and \"[[No Excuses (Alice in Chains song)|No Excuses]]\") and 1995's ''[[Alice in Chains (album)|Alice in Chains]]'' (also contained radio hits such as \"[[Heaven Beside You]]\" and \"[[Grind (song)|Grind]]\"), both topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and earned the band several [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations.\n\nAlice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, largely due to Staley's [[substance abuse]], which resulted in his death in 2002 and caused the band to go on hiatus. Alice in Chains reunited in 2005, with DuVall joining in 2006 as rhythm guitarist and sharing lead vocal duties; the band has since released three more albums: ''[[Black Gives Way to Blue]]'' (2009), ''[[The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here]]'' (2013), and ''[[Rainier Fog]]'' (2018).\n\nIn the US alone, Alice in Chains has sold over 30 million [[RIAA certification|RIAA-certified]] records. They have had 18 Top 10 songs on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and five No. 1 hits, and has received 11 Grammy Award nominations. The band has been included in numerous greatest of all time lists, including a position of No. 34 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" special and No. 15 in ''[[Hit Parader]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Greatest Live Bands\" list.",
