  "name": "Phil Lynott",
  "description": "'''Philip Parris Lynott''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|n|ɒ|t}}, {{respell|LIE|not}}; 20 August 1949 – 4 January 1986) was an Irish musician best known as the co-founder, lead vocalist, bassist, and primary songwriter for the hard rock band [[Thin Lizzy]]. He was noted for his distinctive [[plectrum|pick]]-based style on the bass and for his imaginative lyrics, including working-class tales and numerous characters drawn from personal influences and [[Celts (modern)|Celtic culture]].\n\nBorn in England to [[Philomena Lynott|an Irish mother]] and Guyanese father, Lynott was raised in Ireland by his grandparents. He remained close to his mother throughout his life. He fronted several bands as a lead vocalist, including [[Skid Row (Irish band)|Skid Row]] alongside [[Gary Moore]], before learning the bass and forming Thin Lizzy in 1969. The band had several hits in the 1970s such as \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\", \"[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]\", \"[[Jailbreak (Thin Lizzy song)|Jailbreak]]\", and \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\", and became popular live performers due to Lynott's vocals and songwriting skills combined with his bandmates' dual lead guitars. Over the mid-to-late 1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and published two poetry books. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band [[Grand Slam (band)|Grand Slam]].\n\nDuring the 1980s, Lynott increasingly suffered from drug addiction, particularly to [[heroin]]. He and Moore had one more chart success with their joint song \"[[Out in the Fields (song)|Out in the Fields]]\" in 1985, before Lynott died of [[septicaemia]]-induced [[pneumonia]] and [[heart failure]] the following year. He remains a popular figure in rock music, and a statue in his memory was erected in [[Dublin]] in 2005.",
