He was the co-founder, lead vocalist, bassist, and primary songwriter for the hard rock band [[Thin Lizzy]].

After initial success with \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\", the band had several hits in the mid-1970s, such as \"[[The Boys Are Back in Town]]\", \"[[Jailbreak (Thin Lizzy song)|Jailbreak]]\" and \"[[Waiting for an Alibi]]\", and became a popular live attraction combining Lynott's vocal and songwriting skills with dual lead guitars. Towards the end of the 1970s, Lynott embarked upon a solo career and published two books of poetry. After Thin Lizzy disbanded, he assembled and fronted the band [[Grand Slam (band)|Grand Slam]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Lynott increasingly suffered drug-related problems, particularly an addiction to [[heroin]].
