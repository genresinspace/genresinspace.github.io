  "description": "'''Seventeen''' was an Indonesian [[pop rock]] band that was formed in 1999 in [[Yogyakarta]] by schoolmates Yudhi Rus Harjanto, Herman Sikumbang, Zulianto \"Zozo\" Angga, and Windu Andi Darmawan, all of whom were 17 when the group was formed. Vocalists Yohan \"Doni\" Saputro and Riefian \"Ifan\" Fajarsyah, and bassist M. Awal \"Bani\" Purbani joined the band at a later date.\n\nThe group was performing in a tent at the [[Tanjung Lesung]] resort on 22 December 2018 when the [[2018 Sunda Strait tsunami]], the result of an eruption from [[Anak Krakatau]], struck the stage from behind, killing almost all members of the band. Fajarsyah was the sole survivor from the band, which was then dissolved. As of 2024, Fajarsyah, Harjanto, Saputro and Angga are the last surviving members of the band.",
