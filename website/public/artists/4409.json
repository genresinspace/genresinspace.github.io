  "description": "'''Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft''' ({{IPA|de|ˈdɔʏtʃ ʔameʁiˈkaːnɪʃə ˈfʁɔʏntʃaft}}; \"German-American Friendship\"), or '''D.A.F.''', was a German [[electropunk]]/[[Neue Deutsche Welle]] band from [[Düsseldorf]], formed in 1978 featuring [[Gabi Delgado-López|Gabriel \"Gabi\" Delgado-López]] (vocals), [[Robert Görl]] (drums, percussion, electronic instruments), [[Kurt Dahlke|Kurt \"Pyrolator\" Dahlke]] (electronic instruments), Michael Kemner (bass-guitar) and Wolfgang Spelmans (guitar). Kurt Dahlke was replaced by [[Chrislo Haas]] (electronic instruments, bass guitar, saxophone) in 1979. Since 1981, the band has consisted of Delgado-López and Görl. Gabi Delgado-Lopez died on 22 March 2020 aged 61.\n\nIn interviews they claimed not to target anything or anyone specific while writing lyrics to be taken as a parody of words and phrases floating around in the public media. \"Sato-Sato\" and \"Der Mussolini\" are both examples of songs written around Delgado-López's fascination with the sound of a particular word. A few months before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], D.A.F. released \"The Sheriff (An Anti-American Song)\".\n\nThe album ''Alles ist gut'' (all is good) received the German \"[[Deutscher Schallplattenpreis|Schallplattenpreis]]\" award by the \"Deutsche Phono-Akademie\" (The German Phono-Academy), an association of the German recording industry.",
