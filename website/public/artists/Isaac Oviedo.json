  "description": "'''Isaac Oviedo''' (July 6, 1902 – June 16, 1992) was a Cuban [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]] player, singer and songwriter. He was the founder and leader of the Septeto Matancero for over 50 years, and the author of many famous ''[[son cubano|sones]]'' such as \"Engancha carretero\". Throughout his long career Oviedo only recorded a handful of sessions, mostly for American record labels. He has been called \"one of the greatest Cuban tres players\" by other musicians such as [[Efraín Ríos]] and [[Pancho Amat]]. According to the latter, Oviedo was the pioneering and most influential ''tresero'' of the ''septeto'' format (the major type of son ensemble of the 1920s and '30s). His technical innovations include the ''alzapúa'' thumb stroke and the use of the pinky finger.\n\nHis son Ernesto played in his band since the 1940s and became a successful [[bolero]] singer, while his other son Gilberto, known as [[Papi Oviedo]], has also had a long career as a ''tresero'', playing with [[Conjunto Chappottín]], [[Estrellas de Chocolate]] and [[Orquesta Revé]].",
