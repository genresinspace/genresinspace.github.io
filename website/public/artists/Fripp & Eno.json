  "description": "'''Fripp & Eno''' is a UK-based ambient music side project composed of musician and composer [[Brian Eno]] and guitarist [[Robert Fripp]]. The duo have released four studio albums, beginning with 1973's ''[[(No Pussyfooting)|No Pussyfooting]]''. The music created by this pair is entirely instrumental and makes extensive use of [[Frippertronics]], a [[Tape loop|tape delay]] technique developed by Fripp. Much of the duo's music combines Frippertronics with Fripp's guitar, the Fripp Pedalboard and Frizzbox (with subsequent sound treatments by Eno) along with Eno playing various keyboards, synthesizers and modified Revox A77 tape recorders.\n\nFripp & Eno released their first two albums in quick succession, with ''No Pussyfooting'' released in 1973 and the follow-up album ''[[Evening Star (Fripp & Eno album)|Evening Star]]'' released two years later in 1975. Following the release of ''Evening Star'', the duo went on a studio album hiatus, though members Brian Eno and Robert Fripp continued to collaborate on each other's solo albums. In 2004, the duo returned to the studio for ''[[The Equatorial Stars]]''. In 2006, Fripp & Eno released the album ''[[Beyond Even (1992â€“2006)|Beyond Even]]'', which contained material recorded between 1992 and 2006. As of 2025, the duo has not officially disbanded, though there has been no word about plans for new music. \n\nIn 2015, Fripp & Eno were ranked No. 17 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.",
