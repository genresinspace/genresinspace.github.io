  "description": "'''Marc Bolan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|l|ə|n}} {{respell|BOH|lən}}; born '''Mark Feld'''; 30 September 1947&nbsp;– 16 September 1977) was an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and poet. He was a pioneer of the [[glam rock]] movement in the early 1970s with his band [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]]. Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[post-punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[indie rock]], [[Britpop]] and [[alternative rock]]. He was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020 as a member of T. Rex.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he rose to fame as the founder and leader of the [[psychedelic folk]] band Tyrannosaurus Rex, with whom he released four critically acclaimed albums and had one minor hit; \"Debora\". Bolan had started as an acoustic singer-writer before heading into electric music prior to the recording of T. Rex's first single \"[[Ride a White Swan]]\" which went to number two in the UK singles chart. From 1970 to 1973, T. Rex was popular in the UK, comparable to [[the Beatles]], with a run of eleven top ten singles, four of which reached number one: \"[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]\", \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\". The 1971 album ''[[Electric Warrior]]'', with all songs written by Bolan, received critical acclaim, reached number 1 in the UK and became a landmark album in glam rock. From 1973, he started marrying rock with other influences, including [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[disco]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].\n\nBolan died in a car crash in 1977. A memorial stone and bust of Bolan, [[Marc Bolan's Rock Shrine]], was unveiled at the site where he died in [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], west London. His musical influence as guitarist and songwriter is profound; he inspired many later acts over the following decades. Bolan's March 1971 appearance on the BBC's music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', wearing glitter on his face, performing the UK chart topper \"Hot Love\" is cited as the start of the glam rock movement.\n\nMusic critic [[Ken Barnes (writer)|Ken Barnes]] called Bolan \"the man who started it all\". The 1971 album ''Electric Warrior'' has been described by [[AllMusic]] as \"the album that essentially kick-started the UK glam rock craze\". Producer [[Tony Visconti]], who worked with Bolan during his heyday, stated: \"What I saw in Marc Bolan had nothing to do with strings, or very high standards of artistry; what I saw in him was raw talent. I saw genius. I saw a potential rock star in Marc – right from the minute, the hour I met him.\"",
