  "description": "'''The Adicts''' are a British [[punk rock]] band from [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], England. A popular English [[punk rock]] band of the 1980s, they were often in the [[Independent music|indie]] charts during that decade.\n\nThe Adicts originated as The Afterbirth in late 1975 but never had any music or played any shows. They later became The Pinz. They soon changed their name to the Adicts and became known for their distinctive ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]'' \"droog\" image. \"Droog\" is a noun derived from the fictional [[Nadsat]] language, meaning \"friend\" (a combination of Russian and English). This image, along with their urgent, uptempo music and light-hearted lyrics, helped set them apart from other punk bands. In the 1980s, they temporarily changed their name to Fun Adicts (for a children's TV appearance) and then ADX (after signing to a major label).\n\nTheir music has catchy melodies and lyrics, often featuring extra instruments and sound clips - such as carousel music in \"How Sad\", violin played by Derick Cook in \"Joker in the Pack\", as well as [[gong]]s and keyboard percussion by Anthony Boyd in \"Chinese Takeaway\".\n\nThe musicians wear all-white clothing with black boots and black [[bowler hat]]s. The singer, Keith \"Monkey\" Warren, wears [[Joker (playing card)|joker]] makeup, wildly patterned suits (such as [[checkerboard]] or [[polka dot]]), flared trousers, colourful dress shirts, a bowler hat and gloves. The band's visual look is complemented by their stage shows, involving items such as streamers, confetti, playing cards, beach balls, joker hats, toy instruments, bubbles, and glitter.",
