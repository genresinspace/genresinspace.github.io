  "description": "'''Buzz''' ({{Korean|버즈}}) is a South Korean pop rock band formed in 2000. The band currently consists of members Yoon Woo-hyun (guitars), [[Min Kyung-hoon]] (vocals), Son Sung-hee (guitars), Kim Ye-joon (drums), and Shin Joon-ki (bass).. The band found major success in South Korea, becoming one of the most influential South Korean rock bands of the 2000s. Buzz's major success in 2006 was marked by three of the band's songs reaching the MTV-Korea top 10 list in a mere week, consecutively- \"My Love,\" \"My Darling,\" and \"남자를 몰라\" (You don't know men). In addition, the song \"은인\" (Savior) made it to the top 14 list.\n\nIn July 2007, the band officially went on hiatus as four of the band members began, or had already begun, to serve the 26 month mandatory service in the South Korean Army required of all South Korean men. [[Min Kyung-hoon]], the vocalist of the group proceeded in a solo career while the anticipated fourth album was due to be completed once the band completed their duties. A new vocalist, Na Do-Kyun, was auditioned at a later stage. After Na left the group, he debuted with [[History (band)|HISTORY]], a boy band under [[LOEN Entertainment]] that has since disbanded.",
