  "description": "'''Nomeansno''' (sometimes stylized as '''NoMeansNo''' or spelled '''No Means No''') was a Canadian [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], and later relocated to [[Vancouver]]. They released 11 albums, including a [[The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy|collaborative album]] with [[Jello Biafra]], and numerous EPs and singles.  Critic Martin Popoff described their music as \"the mightiest merger between the hateful aggression of [[punk rock|punk]] and the discipline of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\"  Nomeansno's distinct [[hardcore punk]] sound, complex instrumentation, and dark, \"savagely intelligent\" lyrics inspired subsequent musicians.  They were a formative influence on [[punk jazz]], [[post-hardcore]], [[math rock]], and [[emo]].\n\nFormed in 1979 by brothers [[Rob Wright|Rob]] and [[John Wright (musician)|John Wright]], they began as a two-piece punk band influenced by [[jazz]] and [[progressive rock]].  They self-released their debut ''[[Mama (Nomeansno album)|Mama]]'' LP in 1982, added guitarist [[Andy Kerr (musician)|Andy Kerr]] the following year, and signed with [[Alternative Tentacles]].  Kerr departed in late 1991 after five LPs with the band, and the group returned to its two-piece formation for the ''[[Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy?]]'' album.\n\nGuitarist [[Tom Holliston]], and briefly second drummer [[Ken Kempster]], joined in 1993. After three further LPs, they left Alternative Tentacles and issued their final album, ''[[All Roads Lead to Ausfahrt]]'', in 2006.  The Western Canadian Music Hall of Fame inducted them in 2015, and they retired the following year.",
