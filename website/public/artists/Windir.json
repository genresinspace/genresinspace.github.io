  "description": "'''Windir''' (\"Warrior\" in [[English language|English]]) was a [[black metal]] band from [[Sogndal]], [[Norway]]. The band was formed in 1994 by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist [[Terje Bakken|Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken]], and released its debut album, ''[[Sóknardalr]]'', in 1997. Windir combined black metal with Scandinavian [[folk music]], [[Scandinavian folklore|folklore]], and [[mythology]], and many of the band's lyrics were written in [[Sognamål]]. Windir produced four albums in their nearly ten years of existence. The band broke up in March 2004 after frontman Valfar died of [[hypothermia]] after becoming caught in a blizzard on his way to his family's cabin in Norway. Following his death, the remaining band members went on to form several new bands, including [[Vreid]], Mistur, and [[Cor Scorpii]].\n\nMost of the band's early albums featured lyrics written in Valfar's native dialect, Sognamål. The band had an \"intense affinity for traditional music and Norwegian texts, drawing much of its lyrical content from local sagas, using traditional folk tunes in its music, and singing in an archaic rural dialect\". The term \"Sognametal\", coined in reference to the genre established by Windir, has inspired many bands from the small region of [[Sogn og Fjordane]], most of whom are ex-members of Windir or their friends. These bands include: [[Vreid]], [[Cor Scorpii]], Mistur, Sigtyr, and Feigd.",
