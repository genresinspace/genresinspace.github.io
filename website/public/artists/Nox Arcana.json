  "name": "Nox Arcana",
  "description": "'''Nox Arcana''' is the American [[neoclassical dark wave]], [[dark ambient]] musical project of Joseph Vargo. It was founded in 2003 as a duo with William Piotrowski, who left in 2008 to pursue a career in [[film score]] composing but still acts as its studio engineer while Vargo continued on as sole composer and musician performing under the name. According to the Nox Arcana biography, the name is derived from two Latin words that roughly translate to \"mysteries of the night.\"\n\nAll of Nox Arcana's music is released [[independent music|independently]] on the Monolith Graphics label, a publishing company owned by Vargo. With their third album Nox Arcana became a ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' Top Ten charting artist in the holiday genre.\n\nNox Arcana's music is often used to provide atmosphere for [[Film score|films]], public events, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] games and during [[Halloween]] at theme parks, several of which have based [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted attractions]] on Nox Arcana's original theme albums.\n\nNox Arcana releases on average two to three albums per year, each with 21 tracks. Joseph Vargo wrote and recorded solo since 2009 with ''[[Blackthorn Asylum]]'', ''[[Winter's Eve]]'', ''[[Theater of Illusion]]'', ''[[The Dark Tower (Nox Arcana album)|The Dark Tower]]'', an album based on his book series,, ''[[Winter's Majesty]]'', and ''Legion of Shadows'', which was a dedication to fans, and marked Nox Arcana's 10-year anniversary.   For the next decade Joseph Vargo performed solo on ''[[Gothic (Nox Arcana album)|Gothic]]'', ''The Haunted Symphony'',\n ''Season of the Witch'', and ''Ebonshire'', a collection of songs from 5 earlier volumes in a series of winter holiday EPs inspired by Nox Arcana's holiday music trilogy: ''[[Winter's Knight]]'' (2005), ''[[Winter's Eve]]'' (2009), and ''[[Winter's Majesty]]'' (2012), which are each set in a fantasy realm called \"Ebonshire\". The five volumes culminated in 2018 with the ''Ebonshire'' CD release, which included four new tracks.  \n\nNox Arcana released three albums, an EP, and several singles during 2025: ''Pandora's Box'', a theme based on the ancient Greek myth of [[Pandora]]; ''Darkfall, Vol. 4'', a follow-up to the earlier Billboard charting releases in the ''Darkfall'' music series; ''Doctor Arcana Official Gaming Soundtrack'', a collection of all the songs from both game soundtracks onto one CD; and delved into the rock genre with ''Hard Nox'', which features vocals on the majority of tracks, several performed by Joseph Vargo, along with electric guitars and bass drums. In December, three more songs were released for the winter holidays season, a tradition begun in 2019 and continuing each year thereafter.",
