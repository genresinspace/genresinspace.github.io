  "description": "'''Kourosh Yaghmaei''' ({{langx|fa|کورش یغمایی}}; also spelled as '''Kourosh Yaghmaee'''; born 3 December 1946) is an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] singer-songwriter, composer and record producer, who started his career in the early 1970s. Regarded as one of the greatest [[Persian language|Persian]] [[psychedelic rock]] musicians in the history of [[Iranian rock]] music, he is known as \"the Godfather of Iranian psychedelic rock\",{{sfn|Keshavarz|2011|p=39}}{{r|NA-Godfather}} as well as \"the king of rock\".{{sfn|Breyley|Fatemi|2015|p=135}}\n\nBorn in 1946 in [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] to [[Zoroastrian]] parents, Yaghmaei later grew up in [[Tehran]]. Most of his songs combine [[Persian literature|classical Persian poetry]] with more contemptary works, often incorporating his own lyrics. Musically, Yaghmaei is recognized as being an early cross-pollinator for [[Persian traditional music]] and the western [[psychedelic rock]] of the era, with artists [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Pink Floyd]] often listed as specific influences.{{r|Nilufar}} He began his solo career in 1973 with his first single \"''Gol-e Yakh''\" (\"Ice Flower\"), a track selling more than 5 million copies in the domestic market.{{sfn|Breyley|Fatemi|2015|p=129}} This single was followed by the eponymous ''[[Gol-e Yakh]]'' (1973), which included the song. Much of Yaghmaei's work is well known by the [[Iranian diaspora]], with singles \"Gol-e Yakh\", \"Havar Havar\" (\"Shout Shout\"), \"Khaar\" (\"Thistle\"), \"Leila\", \"Paiz\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Reyhan\" being particularly beloved. In 2011, his first [[compilation album]], ''[[Back from the Brink: Pre-Revolution Psychedelic Rock from Iran: 1973–1979]]'', was released by [[Now-Again Records]] to international recognition. ''[[Vogue Paris|Vogue]]'' has described Yaghmei as ''\"psyche singer, stylish, moustached and funky\"''.{{r|Vogue-Olivier Lamm}} Following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]], Yaghmaei's work was banned from the country's airways, markets and homes, and his name from the press.",
