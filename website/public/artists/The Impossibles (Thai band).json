The Impossibles were among the first Thai pop bands to cover English-language songs and were the first Thai rock band to record an English-language album overseas, during a tour of Europe.\n\nIn addition to rock and pop, the band's sound frequently crossed over into [[funk music|funk]], [[R&B]], [[country music|country]] and [[folk music|folk]] and psychedelic folk. They did two covers of [[Kool and the Gang]] tracks (\"Give it Up\" and \"Love the Life You Live\") as well as (\"[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]\") by [[Neil Sedaka]] and [[Howard Greenfield]] on their 1975 album \"Hot Pepper\", an all-English lyrics recording. The band also performed in [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai films]].\n\nThe band broke up in 1977, but it has frequently performed at reunions over the years, and its members remain active in music in Thailand.\n\nSetha Sirachaya and other members of the band appeared in ''[[The Possible]]'', a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai film]] about a fictional musical group from 1969 called The Possible who supposedly were rivals of The Impossibles.
