  "description": "'''Cabine C''' ({{IPA|pt|kaˈbini ˈse}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"Cabin C\") was a short-lived [[Brazil]]ian [[post-punk]] band from [[São Paulo]]. With their sonority inspired by acts such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[the Cure]], [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[Talking Heads]], and vocalist [[Ciro Pessoa]]'s lyrics influenced by [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poets such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and by playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], they are considered to be one of the first and most famous Brazilian [[gothic rock]] bands (even though Pessoa publicly rejected any associations with the [[goth subculture]] at the time), as well as forerunners of the [[Cold wave (music)|cold wave]] movement in Brazil.\n\nDespite their short lifespan, they have a strong [[cult following]] to the present day.",
