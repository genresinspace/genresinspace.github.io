  "name": "Jim Morrison",
  "description": "'''James Douglas \"Jim\" Morrison''' (December 8, 1943 â€“ July 3, 1971) was an American singer, songwriter, and poet who was the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of the rock band [[the Doors]]. Due to his charismatic persona, poetic lyrics, distinctive voice, and unpredictable performances, along with the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of the most influential frontmen in rock history. Since his death, his fame has endured as one of popular culture's top rebellious and oft-displayed [[Pop icon|icons]], representing the [[generation gap]] and youth [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]].\n\nTogether with keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]], Morrison founded the Doors in 1965 in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice, California]]. The group spent two years in obscurity until shooting to prominence with its number-one hit single in the United States \"[[Light My Fire]]\", which was taken from the band's [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Morrison recorded a total of six studio albums with the Doors, all of which sold well and many of which received critical acclaim. He frequently gave [[spoken word]] poetry passages while the band was playing live. Manzarek said Morrison \"embodied [[hippie]] counterculture rebellion\".\n\nMorrison developed an [[alcohol dependency]], which at times affected his performances on stage. In 1971, Morrison died unexpectedly in a [[Paris]] apartment at the [[27 Club|age of 27]], amid several conflicting witness reports. Since no [[autopsy]] was performed, the cause of Morrison's death remains disputed. Although the Doors recorded two more albums after Morrison died, his death greatly affected the band's fortunes, and they split up two years later. In 1993, Morrison was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] along with the other Doors members. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[NME]]'', and ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' have ranked him among the greatest rock singers of all time.",
