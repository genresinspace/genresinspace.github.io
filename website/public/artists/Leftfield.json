  "name": "Leftfield",
  "description": "'''Leftfield''' are a British [[electronic music]] group formed in [[London]] in 1989, a duo of Neil Barnes (born 6 August 1960) and Paul Daley (the latter formerly of [[The Rivals (band)|The Rivals]] and [[A Man Called Adam (group)|A Man Called Adam]]). The duo was influential in the evolution of electronic music in the 1990s, with ''[[Mixmag]]'' describing them as \"the single most influential production team working in British dance music\". As with many of their contemporaries, such as [[The Chemical Brothers]] and [[Fatboy Slim]], Leftfield are notable for their use of guest vocalists in their works. Among them are [[Toni Halliday]] on \"[[Original (Leftfield song)|Original]]\", [[Johnny Rotten]] on \"[[Open Up (Leftfield song)|Open Up]]\", Djum Djum on \"[[Afro-Left]]\", [[Earl 16]] and Cheshire Cat on \"[[Release the Pressure]]\", and Grian Chatten of [[Fontaines D.C.]] on \"Full Way Round\". The term [[progressive house]] was coined to define their style, a fusion of [[house music|house]] with [[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]].\n\nThere was a hiatus in recording and live performances between 2002 and 2010. When Barnes revived Leftfield, Daley declined to be involved, preferring to focus on his solo career. After touring for a few years, Barnes finished writing new material for a third Leftfield album, ''[[Alternative Light Source]]'', which was released in 2015. In 2022, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[This Is What We Do]]''.",
