Their debut album, ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991), incorporated the sounds of [[Madchester]] and [[shoegaze]]. Following a stylistic change influenced by British [[guitar pop]] groups such as [[the Kinks]], [[the Beatles]], and [[XTC]], Blur released the albums ''[[Modern Life Is Rubbish]]'' (1993), ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' (1995). ''Parklife'' lead single \"[[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]\" (1994) became a hit in the UK and the US, respectively peaking at number 5 on the [[UK singles chart]] and number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. As a result, the band helped to popularise the [[Britpop]] genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a widely publicised chart battle with rival band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in 1995 dubbed \"[[Britpop#\"The Battle of Britpop\"|the Battle of Britpop]]\". \n \nBlur's [[Blur (Blur album)|self-titled fifth album]] (1997) saw another stylistic shift, influenced by the [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] styles of American [[indie rock]] groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. Its single \"[[Song 2]]\" became popular on alternative radio in the US. Their next album, ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999), saw the band experimenting with [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[art rock]] styles, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn and Coxon. Their seventh album, ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' (2003), continued their experimentation with electronic sounds and was shaped by Albarn's growing interest in [[world music]], featuring more minimal guitar work. Coxon left the band early in the sessions for ''Think Tank'', and Blur disbanded for several years after the album's tour in 2003.\n\nIn 2009, Blur reunited with Coxon and embarked on a European reunion tour. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[2012 Brit Awards|Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. Their eighth album, ''[[The Magic Whip]]'' (2015), was their first in twelve years and the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts. After the ''Magic Whip'' tour, Blur went on hiatus until the release of their ninth album, ''[[The Ballad of Darren]]'', in 2023.",
