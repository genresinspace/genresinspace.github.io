  "description": "'''Keith Farrelle Cozart''' (born August 15, 1995),{{sfn|Buyanovsky|2013}} better known by his stage name '''Chief Keef''', is an American rapper and record producer. Born and raised in [[Chicago]]'s [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]], he began his recording career as a teenager and initially garnered regional attention and praise for his mixtapes in the early 2010s. Cozart is often credited with popularizing the hip hop subgenre [[drill music|drill]] for mainstream audiences, and is considered a progenitor of the genre.\n\nHis fifth mixtape, ''[[Back from the Dead (mixtape)|Back from the Dead]]'' (2012), spawned the single \"[[I Don't Like]]\" (featuring [[Lil Reese]]), which became a local [[hit song|hit]] and marked his first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. A bidding war between several major labels resulted in Cozart signing with [[Interscope Records]], who commercially re-released the song, along with its follow-up, \"[[Love Sosa]]\", which received [[RIAA certification|quintuple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Both served as lead singles for his debut studio album, ''[[Finally Rich]]'' (2012), which was met with moderate critical and commercial response, also serving as his only release on a [[major label]]. His following independent studio albums—''[[Bang 3]]'' (2015), ''Bang 3, Pt. 2'' (2015), ''[[4Nem]]'' (2021), and ''[[Almighty So 2]]'' (2024)—have each entered the ''Billboard'' 200. Two of his guest appearances—on the songs \"[[Bean (Kobe)]]\" by [[Lil Uzi Vert]] and \"[[For All the Dogs|All the Parties]]\" by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]—have peaked within the [[top 40]] of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.\n\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has credited Cozart with \"personif[ying] Chicago drill\", while ''[[Stereogum]]'' referred to him as a \"modern rap [[folk hero]]\".",
