  "description": "'''The Supremes''' were an American [[girl group]] formed in [[Detroit]], Michigan, in 1959 as '''the Primettes'''. A premier act of [[Motown Records]] during the 1960s, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and the most successful American [[vocal group|vocal band]], with [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one songs|12 number-one singles]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]]. Their breakthrough is considered to have made it possible for future African-American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] musicians to find mainstream success. ''Billboard'' ranked the Supremes as the 16th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time.\n\n[[Florence Ballard]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Betty McGlown]], the original members, were all from the [[Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects|Brewster-Douglass]] public housing project in Detroit. Forming as the Primettes, they were the sister act to [[the Primes]] (with [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]] and [[Eddie Kendricks]], who went on to form [[the Temptations]]). [[Barbara Martin (singer)|Barbara Martin]] replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the group in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson continued as a [[trio (music)|trio]].\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and Holland–Dozier–Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president [[Berry Gordy]] renamed the group '''Diana Ross & the Supremes''', and replaced Ballard with [[Cindy Birdsong]]. In 1970, Ross left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by [[Jean Terrell]], and the group's name was reverted to the Supremes. During the mid-1970s, the lineup continued to change with [[Lynda Laurence]], [[Scherrie Payne]] and [[Susaye Greene]] joining until the group, 18 years after its formation, disbanded in 1977.",
