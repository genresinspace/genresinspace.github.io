  "description": "'''Nicholas Rodney Drake''' (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter. An accomplished [[acoustic guitar]]ist, Drake signed to [[Island Records]] at the age of twenty while still a student at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His debut album, ''[[Five Leaves Left]]'', was released in 1969, and was followed by two more albums, ''[[Bryter Layter]]'' (1971) and ''[[Pink Moon]]'' (1972). While Drake did not reach a wide audience during his brief lifetime, his music found acclaim and he gradually received wider recognition following his death.\n\nDrake suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]] and was reluctant to perform in front of live audiences. Upon completion of ''Pink Moon'', he withdrew from both performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural [[Warwickshire]]. On 25 November 1974, Drake was found dead at the age of 26 due to an overdose of [[antidepressant]]s.\n\nDrake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective collection ''[[Fruit Tree (box set)|Fruit Tree]]'' allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. Drake has come to be credited as an influence on numerous artists. The first Drake biography in English appeared in 1997; it was followed by the documentary films ''A Stranger Among Us'' in 1999 and ''A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake'' in 2000.",
