  "description": "'''Huddie William Ledbetter''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|j|uː|d|i}} {{respell|HYOO|dee}}; January 1888 or 1889 – December 6, 1949), better known by the stage name '''Lead Belly''', was an American [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] singer notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the [[twelve-string guitar]], and the folk standards he introduced, including his renditions of \"[[In the Pines]]\" (also known as \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\"), \"[[Pick a Bale of Cotton]]\", \"[[Goodnight, Irene]]\", \"[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]\", \"[[Cotton Fields]]\", and \"[[Boll Weevil (song)|Boll Weevil]]\".\n\nLead Belly usually played a twelve-string guitar, but he also played the piano, [[mandolin]], harmonica, violin, and [[diatonic accordion|windjammer]] (accordion). In some of his recordings, he sang while clapping his hands or stomping his foot.\n\nLead Belly's songs covered a wide range of genres, including [[gospel music]], [[blues]], and [[folk music]], as well as a number of topics, including women, liquor, prison life, racism, cowboys, work, sailors, cattle herding, and dancing. He also wrote songs about people in the news, such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], the [[Scottsboro Boys]] and [[Howard Hughes]]. Lead Belly was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008.\n\nThough many releases credit him as \"Leadbelly\", he wrote his name as \"Lead Belly\". This is the spelling on his tombstone and is used by the Lead Belly Foundation. He didn't care for the \"Lead Belly\" stage name and always introduced himself by his given name: Huddie Ledbetter.",
