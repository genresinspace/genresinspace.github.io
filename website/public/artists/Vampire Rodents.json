  "description": "'''Vampire Rodents''' was a [[sound collage]] and [[experimental music]] ensemble based out of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], although its core members originally came from [[Canada]]. The creative nucleus of the project comprised vocalist and composer [[Daniel Vahnke]] and keyboardist [[Victor Wulf]]. Daniel Vahnke was primarily influenced by [[20th-century classical music|20th-century classical]] and [[avant-garde music]], whereas Wulf drew from [[New-age music|new age]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and synth-driven [[pop music]]. Their work also dabbled in [[big band]], [[bebop]], [[musique concr√®te]], [[industrial music|industrial]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] and [[Music of Greece|Greek music]].\n\nVampire Rodents debuted with ''[[War Music (Vampire Rodents album)|War Music]]'' (1991), an album that showcased their knack for dark humor and experimentation with the pop and industrial music format. ''[[Premonition (Vampire Rodents album)|Premonition]]'' (1992), recorded with violinist and cellist Andrea Akastia, revealed the band's artistic ambitious and interest in [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] and [[ambient music]]. Considered by some to be the group's magnum opus, ''[[Lullaby Land (album)|Lullaby Land]]'' (1993) further expanded the sound with the inclusion of additional musicians, [[House music|house beats]], [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing rhythms]] and [[world music]].\n\nIn 1993 Akastia and Wulf ceased to make direct contributions to Vampire Rodents and it became Vahnke's solo project, although he continued to utilize music his former bandmates had recorded previous to their departure. Vampire Rodents embraced an [[electro-industrial]] sound informed by orchestral music on ''[[Clockseed]]'' (1995) with the help of producer Chase and the contributions of numerous musicians already established in the 90s industrial rock scene. The final album, ''[[Gravity's Rim]]'' (1996), returned to the more aggressive and sardonic nature of past work while emphasizing dense string and horn arrangements backed by drum machine rhythms.\n\nVampire Rodents' last recordings were made in 1996 when Vahnke was preparing the follow-up to ''Gravity's Rim''. Legal issues with [[Fifth Colvmn Records]] unexpectedly halted activity and the project was put on hiatus. After over a decade of inactivity, Daniel Vahnke officially announced his musical retirement and the project's abandonment in 2009. In 2016, Vahnke established an official YouTube page titled Rodentia Productions and began issuing unreleased material with the suggestion that it would be made available for purchase. On November 11, 2017, Vampire Rodents' sixth album, ''[[Noises in the Wall]]'', was issued digitally on their official [[Bandcamp]] page.",
