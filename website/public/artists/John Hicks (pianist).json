  "description": "'''John Josephus Hicks Jr.''' (December 21, 1941 â€“ May 10, 2006) was an American [[jazz]] pianist, composer, and arranger. He was leader of more than 30 recordings and played as a sideman on more than 300.\n\nAfter early experiences backing blues musicians, Hicks moved to New York in 1963. He was part of [[Art Blakey]]'s band for two years, accompanied vocalist [[Betty Carter]] from 1965 to 1967, before joining [[Woody Herman]]'s big band, where he stayed until 1970. Following these associations, Hicks expanded into [[free jazz|freer]] bands, including those of trumpeters [[Charles Tolliver]] and [[Lester Bowie]]. He rejoined Carter in 1975; the five-year stay brought him more attention and helped to launch his recording career as a leader. He continued to play and record extensively in the United States and internationally. Under his own leadership, his recordings were mostly [[bebop]]-influenced, while those for other leaders continued to be in a diversity of styles, including multi-year associations with saxophonists [[Arthur Blythe]], [[David Murray (saxophonist)|David Murray]], [[David \"Fathead\" Newman]], and [[Pharoah Sanders]].",
