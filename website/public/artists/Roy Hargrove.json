  "name": "Roy Hargrove",
  "description": "'''Roy Anthony Hargrove''' (October 16, 1969 â€“ November 2, 2018) was an American [[jazz]] musician and composer whose principal instruments were the [[trumpet]] and [[flugelhorn]]. He achieved critical acclaim after winning two [[Grammy Award]]s for differing styles of jazz in 1998 and 2002. Hargrove primarily played in the [[hard bop]] style for the majority of his albums, but also had a penchant for genre-crossing exploration and collaboration with a variety of hip hop, neo soul, R&B and alternative rock artists.  As Hargrove told one reporter, \"I've been around all kinds of musicians, and if a cat can play, a cat can play. If it's gospel, funk, R&B, jazz or hip-hop, if it's something that gets in your ear and it's good, that's what matters.\"",
