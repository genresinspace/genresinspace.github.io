  "description": "'''The W's''' were a [[Christian ska]] and [[swing revival]] band, formed in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], Oregon in 1996. Success came quickly to the band and their first album, ''[[Fourth from the Last]]'',  was a sleeper hit, unexpectedly having had the strongest debut of any Christian album to date for its distributor. They toured the United States several times with a variety of artists. Touring highlights include Pope John Paul II's 1999 visit to St. Louis and [[dc Talk]]'s ''[[Supernatural (dc Talk album)|Supernatural]]'' support tour.\n\nTheir mix of \"swing pop\" and ska was uncommon in the [[Christian music industry]]. They were more popular within [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music]] than their neo-swing counterparts such as the [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]] or [[The Brian Setzer Orchestra]]. Their songwriting was known for its irreverence and frivolity and for its reflections of the band's faith. Before breaking up in 2000, the group released two albums, topped Christian rock radio and sales charts, and won two [[Gospel Music Association]] awards.",
