  "description": "'''Jake Kaufman''' (born 1981; also known as '''virt''' or '''virtjk''') is an American [[video game music]] [[composer]]. After starting out creating [[arrangement]]s and [[remix]]es of video game soundtracks, he began his commercial composing career in 2000 with the score to the [[Game Boy Color]] port of ''[[Q*bert]]''. He continued to compose music for games for the next couple of years, working primarily with [[handheld video game]]s. In 2002, he set up the website VGMix, which hosts video game music remixes, and continues to administrate it. His career began to take off over the next few years, resulting in him transitioning jobs into a full-time freelance composer by 2005. Since then he has worked on several big-name projects such as the ''[[Shantae]]'' series, ''[[Contra 4]]'', ''[[Red Faction: Guerrilla]],'' ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'', ''[[Shovel Knight]]'', and ''[[Crypt of the Necrodancer]]''.",
