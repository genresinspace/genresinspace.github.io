  "description": "'''Mercedes Valdés Granit''' (September 24, 1922 – June 13, 1996), better known as '''Merceditas Valdés''', was a [[Cuba]]n singer who specialized in Afro-Cuban traditional music. Under the aegis of ethnomusicologists [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] and [[Obdulio Morales]], Valdés helped popularize Afro-Cuban music throughout Latin America. In 1949, she became one of the first female [[Santería]] singers to be recorded. Her debut album was released at the start of the 1960s, when the Cuban government nationalized the record industry. She then went on hiatus before making a comeback in the 1980s with a series of albums entitled ''Aché'', in collaboration with artists such as [[Frank Emilio Flynn]] and rumba ensemble [[Yoruba Andabo]]. She also appeared in [[Jane Bunnett]]'s ''[[Spirits of Havana]]'' and continued performing until her death in 1996.",
