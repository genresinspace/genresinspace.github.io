  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''Noriko Kamachi'''|蒲池 法子|Kamachi Noriko|born 10 March 1962}}, known professionally as {{nihongo|'''Seiko Matsuda'''|松田 聖子|Matsuda Seiko}}, is a Japanese singer-songwriter, known for being one of the most popular [[Japanese idol]]s of the 1980s. Since then, she has continued to release new singles and albums, put on annual summer concert tours, and perform at winter dinner shows. She makes frequent appearances in high-profile TV commercials and movies, and on radio. Her alma mater is [[Chuo University]].\n\nDue to her popularity in the 1980s and her long career, she has been dubbed the \"Eternal Idol\" by the Japanese media. In January 2011, the Japanese music television program ''Music Station'' listed her as the 2nd best-selling idol of all time in Japan, with 29,510,000 records sold. She placed right behind pop group [[SMAP]] and ahead of [[Akina Nakamori]], her biggest rival of the 1980s, who was listed in third place. In 2016, however, Ian Martin of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' compared her output unfavorably with that of [[Hikaru Utada]], describing Matsuda as \"first and foremost an idol rather than an artist. Her legacy is best expressed in singles rather than albums.\"\n\nMatsuda once held the record of 25 number-one hits for musicians from 1983 to 2000 (broken by [[B'z]]) and for female solo artists (broken by [[Ayumi Hamasaki]] in 2010). Matsuda was a performer on the finale of [[Kōhaku Uta Gassen|Kouhaku]] (Red White Music Battle) in 2014 and 2015, the prestigious [[NHK]] New Year's Eve Music show on which she has performed 24 times (as of 2020).",
