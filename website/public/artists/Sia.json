  "description": "'''Sia Kate Isobelle Furler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|ə|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Flame, not lame-Sia.wav}} {{respell|SEE|ə}}; born 18 December 1975) is an Australian singer and songwriter. Born and raised in [[Adelaide]], she started her career as a singer in the [[acid jazz]] band Crisp in the mid-1990s. When Crisp disbanded in 1997, she released her debut [[studio album]], ''OnlySee'', in Australia. Sia moved to London and provided vocals for the English duo [[Zero 7]]. She released her second studio album, ''[[Healing Is Difficult]]'', in 2001 and her third, ''[[Colour the Small One]]'', in 2004.\n\nSia moved to New York City in 2005 and toured the US. Her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[Some People Have Real Problems]]'' and ''[[We Are Born]]'', were released in 2008 and 2010 respectively, and both were certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] and attracted wider notice than her earlier albums. Uncomfortable with her growing fame, she took a hiatus from performing and focused on songwriting for other artists, producing successful collaborations \"[[Titanium (David Guetta song)|Titanium]]\" (with [[David Guetta]]), \"[[Diamonds (Rihanna song)|Diamonds]]\" (for [[Rihanna]]), \"[[Wild Ones (Flo Rida song)|Wild Ones]]\" (with [[Flo Rida]]) and \"[[Pretty Hurts]]\" (for [[Beyoncé]]).\n\nSia's sixth studio album, ''[[1000 Forms of Fear]]'', debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], generating the top-ten single \"[[Chandelier (song)|Chandelier]]\" and a trilogy of music videos she co-directed, starring child dancer [[Maddie Ziegler]]. Her seventh album, ''[[This Is Acting]]'' (2016), spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single, \"[[Cheap Thrills (song)|Cheap Thrills]]\". In 2016, she also began her [[Nostalgic for the Present Tour]], which incorporated dancing by Ziegler and others, and other performance art elements. After releasing the Christmas album ''[[Everyday Is Christmas (album)|Everyday Is Christmas]]'' (2017), Sia, [[Diplo]] and [[Labrinth]] released a collaborative studio album, ''[[Labrinth, Sia & Diplo Present... LSD|LSD]]'' (2019). Her tenth album, ''[[Reasonable Woman (album)|Reasonable Woman]]'', was released in 2024.\n\nSia is an advocate for [[animal rights]]. She has written many songs for films. Alongside her [[feature film]] directorial debut, ''[[Music (2021 film)|Music]]'' (2021), which received a negative reception, she wrote and produced an album ''[[Music – Songs from and Inspired by the Motion Picture]]''. Since the release of ''1000 Forms of Fear'', in public she has usually worn a wig that obscures her face to protect her privacy. Among her [[List of awards and nominations received by Sia|accolades]] are ten [[ARIA Awards]], an [[MTV Video Music Award]], and nine [[Grammy Award]] nominations.",
