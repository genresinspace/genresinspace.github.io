They are located in the United States.\n\nFormed in 2003, Bounding Main's musical catalog focuses solely on maritime music. They perform traditional sea shanties and nautical ballads from as far back as 400 years ago, as well as contemporary pieces and original compositions. Bounding Main introduces historical music in a way that appeals to a wide range of listeners. Their use of harmony-focused arrangements brings new life to pieces generally arranged in a simple call and response format. They have a number of different costumes ranging from a traditional \"Elizabethan sea dog\" look to a more casual appearance with their French sailor smocks; they tailor their appearance to the performance and venue. This award winning group has taken several international tours bringing their music to popular shanty and maritime festivals in locations such as Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, France, England, and Canada. They have been referenced in books focusing on maritime music and history, and their music has been included in maritime museum exhibits, used in film soundtracks, and has been preserved in the British Library's Sound Archive.\n\nTheir fan club is known as the ''Bounding Mainiacs''.",
