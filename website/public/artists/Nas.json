  "description": "'''Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɑː|ˈ|s|ɪər}} {{respell|nah|SEER}}; born September 14, 1973), better known by his stage name '''Nas''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ɑː|z}} {{Respell|NAHZ}}), is an American rapper and entrepreneur. Rooted in [[East Coast hip-hop]], he is regarded as [[Billboard and Vibe's 50 Greatest Rappers of All Time|one of the greatest rappers of all time]]. The son of jazz musician [[Olu Dara]], Nas began his musical career in 1989 under the moniker \"Nasty Nas\", and recorded demos under the wing of fellow East Coast rapper [[Large Professor]]. Nas made his recording debut on Professor's group, [[Main Source]]'s 1991 song \"Live at the Barbeque\".\n\nNas signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1992, and released his debut studio album, ''[[Illmatic]]'' on April 19, 1994. An inductee of the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[National Recording Registry]], it has been regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. His second album, ''[[It Was Written]]'' (1996), debuted atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and sold over a quarter-million units in its first week; the album, along with its lead single \"[[If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)]]\" (featuring [[Lauryn Hill]]), propelled Nas into mainstream success. Both released in 1999, Nas' third and fourth albums ''[[I Am... (Nas album)|I Am]]'' and ''[[Nastradamus]]'' were criticized as inconsistent and too commercially oriented, with critics and audiences fearing a decline in the quality of his output.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Nas was involved in a highly publicized feud with fellow New York rapper [[Jay-Z]], popularized by the former's [[diss track]] \"[[Ether (song)|Ether]]\". The feud, along with Nas' subsequent releases ''[[Stillmatic]]'' (2001), ''[[God's Son (album)|God's Son]]'' (2002), and the double album ''[[Street's Disciple]]'' (2004) helped him restore his critical standing. Nas then reconciled with Jay-Z prior to signing with his then-spearheaded label, [[Def Jam Recordings]] in 2006; he adopted a more provocative, politicized direction with the albums ''[[Hip Hop Is Dead]]'' (2006) and his [[Untitled Nas album|untitled ninth studio album]] (2008). In 2010, Nas released ''[[Distant Relatives]]'', a collaborative album with [[Damian Marley]] that donated its royalties to active African charities. His tenth studio album, ''[[Life Is Good (Nas album)|Life Is Good]]'' (2012), was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[55th Annual Grammy Awards]]. After thirteen nominations, his thirteenth studio album, ''[[King's Disease]]'' (2020) won his first Grammy for Best Rap Album at the [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards]]. His five subsequent albums—''[[King's Disease II]]'', ''[[Magic (Nas album)|Magic]]'' (2021), ''[[King's Disease III]]'' (2022), ''[[Magic 2]]'', and ''[[Magic 3]]'' (2023)—were each produced entirely by [[Hit-Boy]] and met with critical praise.\n\nNas has been second ranked by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' on their \"Top 50 Lyricists of All Time\" list in 2012, fourth on [[MTV's Hottest MCs in the Game|MTV's Annual Hottest MCs in the Game]] list in 2013, and was named the \"Greatest MC of All Time\" by [[About.com]] in 2014. The following year, Nas was featured on the \"10 Best Rappers of All Time\" list by [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]. Outside of recording, he serves as [[Publishing|associate publisher]] of [[Mass Appeal (media)|''Mass Appeal'']] magazine, and co-founded its spin-off division [[Mass Appeal Records]], a record label that has signed artists including [[Dave East]], [[N.O.R.E.]], [[Run the Jewels]], and [[Swizz Beatz]], among others. Nas has released seventeen studio albums since 1994, ten of which are certified [[Music recording certification|gold]], platinum or multi-platinum in the U.S.",
