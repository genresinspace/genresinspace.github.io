  "description": "'''Willy DeVille''' (born '''William Paul Borsey Jr.'''; August 25, 1950 – August 6, 2009) was an American singer and songwriter. During his thirty-five-year career, first with his band [[Mink DeVille]] (1974–1986) and later on his own, DeVille created songs rooted in traditional American musical styles. He worked with collaborators from across the spectrum of contemporary music, including [[Jack Nitzsche]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Dr. John]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Allen Toussaint]], and [[Eddie Bo]]. [[Music of Latin America|Latin rhythms]], [[blues]] riffs, [[doo-wop]], [[Cajun music]], strains of French [[cabaret]], and echoes of early-1960s uptown [[Soul music|soul]] can be heard in DeVille's work.\n\nMink DeVille was a [[house band]] at [[CBGB]], the historic New York City nightclub where [[punk rock]] was born in the mid-1970s. DeVille helped redefine the [[Brill Building#\"Brill Building Sound\"|Brill Building sound]]. In 1987 his song \"Storybook Love\" was nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. After his move to [[New Orleans]] in 1988, he helped spark the [[roots revival]] of classic [[New Orleans rhythm and blues|New Orleans R&B]]. His soulful lyrics and explorations in Latin rhythms and sounds helped define a new musical style sometimes called \"Spanish-Americana\".\n\nDeVille died of [[pancreatic cancer]] on August 6, 2009, at the age of 58. Although his commercial success waxed and waned over the years, his legacy as a songwriter has influenced many other musicians, such as Mark Knopfler and [[Peter Wolf]].",
