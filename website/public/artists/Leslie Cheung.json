One of the most influential cultural icons in the [[Sinophone|Sinophone world]], Cheung was known for his debonair demeanor, flamboyant screen characters, and avant-garde, androgynous stage presence. Throughout his 26-year career, he released over 40 music albums and acted in 56 films.{{sfn|Leung|2008|p=85}}\n\nBorn in Kowloon, [[British Hong Kong]], Cheung studied in England from the age of 12 until he returned home in 1976. He garnered attention in 1977 when entering [[Rediffusion Television|RTV]]'s ''Asian Singing Contest'' and achieved popularity in 1984 with a hit single \"Monica\". Cheung is regarded as one of the founding fathers of [[Cantopop]] for defining the music genre in the 1980s. He announced his \"retirement\" from music in 1989 and emigrated to Canada the following year, but he returned to Hong Kong in 1994. His reemergence from the musical retirement in the late 1990s, particularly in his 1996 album ''[[Red (Leslie Cheung album)|Red]]'', was marked by sonic experimentation and daring imagery.\n\nIn addition to music, Cheung achieved pan-Asian fame with such films as ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' (1986) and ''[[A Chinese Ghost Story]]'' (1987). He won the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] at the 1991 [[Hong Kong Film Awards]] for his role in ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990), and became world-renowned for his performances in ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'' (1993) and ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' (1997). \n\nOn April 1st, 2003, Cheung, suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], committed suicide by jumping off the 24th floor of the [[Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong|Mandarin Oriental]] hotel, Hong Kong.",
