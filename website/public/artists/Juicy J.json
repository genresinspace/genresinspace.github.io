He released ten studio albums with the group, which began as an [[underground hip hop|underground]] act until attaining mainstream recognition and signing with [[Loud Records]], an imprint of [[Columbia Records]] in 2000. The group's 2005 single, \"[[Stay Fly]]\", yielded their furthest commercial success, peaking at number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. That same year, they recorded the song \"[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]\" for the film ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'', which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]].\n\nHis first two studio albums, ''[[Chronicles of the Juice Man]]'' (2002) and ''[[Hustle Till I Die]]'' (2009), were released in between Three 6 Mafia projects. He further pursued solo work during the group's hiatus in 2011, and signed with [[Dr. Luke]]'s [[Kemosabe Records]] — an imprint of Columbia Records — and [[Wiz Khalifa]]'s [[Taylor Gang Entertainment]] (as both a recording artist and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]]) the following year. His [[Nightclub|club]]-oriented 2012 single, \"[[Bandz a Make Her Dance]]\" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]] and [[2 Chainz]]), peaked within the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and led his third album and major label debut, ''[[Stay Trippy]]'' (2013), which peaked at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].
