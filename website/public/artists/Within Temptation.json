  "description": "'''Within Temptation''' is a Dutch [[symphonic metal]] band founded in April 1996 by vocalist [[Sharon den Adel]] and guitarist [[Robert Westerholt]]. They have also been classified under other genres, with critics praising the band's experimentation and musical versatility. By 2016, the band had sold more than 3.5&nbsp;million albums worldwide.\n\nAfter the release of their debut album, ''[[Enter (Within Temptation album)|Enter]]'' (1997), which was still rooted in [[gothic metal]], Within Temptation became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single \"[[Ice Queen (song)|Ice Queen]]\" from their second album, ''[[Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)|Mother Earth]]'', which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the [[Buma Export Award|Conamus Exportprijs]], a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Within Temptation's next albums, ''[[The Silent Force]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Heart of Everything]]'' (2007), debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts and expanded their international recognition. In 2008, they released ''[[Black Symphony]]'', a live album recorded with the [[Metropole Orkest|Metropole Orchestra]]. This was followed in 2009 by ''[[An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]]'', another live album, this time with [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] renditions of the songs.\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, ''[[The Unforgiving]]'', was released in 2011 and was one part of a [[transmedia]] effort, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal. The group advanced the exploration of other musical genres in their subsequent releases. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Hydra (Within Temptation album)|Hydra]]'', was released in early 2014 and featured a wide range of guest appearances from other artists. Their seventh studio album, ''[[Resist (Within Temptation album)|Resist]]'', was released in 2019 and incorporated influences from styles such as [[industrial metal|industrial]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]. ''[[Bleed Out (Within Temptation album)|Bleed Out]]'', their latest studio effort, was released in 2023 and contains influences from [[metalcore]] and [[djent]], alongside hints from their initial gothic metal inclinations.",
