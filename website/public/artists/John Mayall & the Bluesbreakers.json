Among those with a tenure in the Bluesbreakers are guitarists [[Eric Clapton]] (later of [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Blind Faith]], [[Derek and the Dominos]] and a successful solo career), [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (later of [[Fleetwood Mac]]) and [[Mick Taylor]] (later of [[the Rolling Stones]]), bassists [[John McVie]] (later of Fleetwood Mac), [[Jack Bruce]] (later of Cream) and [[Tony Reeves]] (later of [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]]), drummers [[Hughie Flint]], [[Aynsley Dunbar]] (later of [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[Jefferson Starship]]), [[Mick Fleetwood]] (later of Fleetwood Mac) and [[Jon Hiseman]] (later of Colosseum), and numerous others.  \n\nMayall used the band name between 1963 and 1970, then dropped it for twelve years. In 1982, a 'Return of the Bluesbreakers' was announced, and the name was used until the band again dissolved in 2008.
