  "description": "'''Swingin' Utters''' (often typeset as '''$wingin' Utter$''', and originally called '''Johnny Peebucks and the Swingin' Utters''') is a Californian [[punk rock]] band that formed in the late 1980s. After U.S. and European tours supporting the release of 2003's \"Dead Flowers, Bottles, Bluegrass and Bones\", some band members concentrated on raising their new families. From 2003-2010, the band played frequently, though mostly limited to the west coast of the United States and Canada, taking a break from any longer, comprehensive touring or recordings. During this time, they released the \"Live in a Dive\" double live album on Fat Wreck Chords (2004), and \"Hatest Grits\", a b-sides and rarities compilation (2008). After a seven-year gap in the release of any new, original recordings, the band released the \"Brand New Lungs\" 3-song 7-inch ep in 2010, followed by the \"Here, Under Protest\" LP (2011), and have since released four more records, and have resumed touring internationally.",
