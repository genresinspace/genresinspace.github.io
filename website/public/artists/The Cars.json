Ocasek and Orr shared lead vocals, and Ocasek was the band's principal songwriter and leader.  \n\nThe Cars were at the forefront of the merger of 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new [[synthesizer]]-oriented pop that became popular in the early 1980s. Music critic [[Robert Palmer (American writer)|Robert Palmer]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that the band's musical style, \"...have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—[[Punk rock|punk]] minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of [[art rock]], the '50s [[rockabilly]] revival and the melodious terseness of [[power pop]]—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend\".\n\nIn 1978, the Cars were named \"Best New Artist\" in the readers' poll conducted by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. The band's debut album, ''[[The Cars (album)|The Cars]]'', sold six million copies and appeared on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart for 139 weeks. The Cars had four Top 10 hits: \"[[Shake It Up (The Cars song)|Shake It Up]]\" (1981), \"[[You Might Think]]\" (1984), \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\" (1984), and \"[[Tonight She Comes]]\" (1985). The band won [[MTV Video Music Awards|Video of the Year]] for \"[[You Might Think]]\" at the first [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]] in 1984.\n\nThe Cars disbanded in 1988. During this first hiatus, Orr died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2000. In 2007, Easton and Hawkes joined [[Todd Rundgren]] and others to form the offshoot band [[The New Cars]]. The surviving original members of the Cars reunited to record the band's seventh and final album, ''[[Move Like This]]'' (2011) [[The Cars North American Tour Spring 2011|toured]] in support of the album, and once again went on hiatus. In April 2018, the Cars were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and the band reunited to perform at the induction ceremony. This became the band's final performance before Ocasek's death the following year.",
