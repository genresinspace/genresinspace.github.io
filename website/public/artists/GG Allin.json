[[AllMusic]] called him \"the most spectacular degenerate in rock n' roll history\", while [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s ''[[That's Tough]]'' labelled him the \"toughest rock star in the world\".\n\nKnown more for his notorious stage antics than his music, Allin recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in [[spoken word]], [[Country music|country]], and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics often expressed themes of violence and [[misanthropy]].{{sfn|Greene|2017|pages=39–48}}\n\nAllin's music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and met with mostly negative reviews from critics, although he maintained a [[cult following]] throughout and after his career.
