  "description": "'''Einherjer''' is a [[Viking metal]] band from [[Haugesund]], [[Norway]], founded in 1993. Some of the band's [[album]]s are heavily [[Traditional folk music|folk]] influenced, while others have a more traditional [[symphonic black metal]] sound. Their lyrics retell [[Norse mythology|Norse]] legends, and each of their albums has its own theme. The band split up in early 2004 after releasing the album ''[[Blot (album)|Blot]]'' in December 2003, but later reformed.\n\nIn December 2004, all members of Einherjer's last lineup, including the band's founders Frode Glesnes and Gerhard Storesund, founded the [[thrash metal]] band Battered together with bass guitarist Ole Moldesæther.\n\nIn September 2008, Einherjer announced that they would reunite to do some selected shows across Europe in 2009, including the [[Ragnarök Festival|Ragnarök]], Kaltenbach and [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken]] festivals. The band signed with Indie Recordings in December 2010; their first album in eight years, ''[[Norrøn]]'' was released in September 2011. Einherjer has since released three more studio albums, and the latest one, ''North Star'', was released on February 26, 2021.",
