  "description": "'''Andre Romell  Young''' (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as '''Dr. Dre''', is an American rapper, record producer, record executive, and actor. He is the founder and [[CEO]] of [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Beats Electronics]], and co-founder of [[Death Row Records]]. Dre began his career as a member of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]] in 1984, and later found fame with the [[gangsta rap]] group [[N.W.A]]. The group popularized explicit lyrics in [[hip-hop]] to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] [[G-funk]], a subgenre of hip-hop characterized by a [[synthesizer]] foundation and slow, heavy production.\n\nReleased as Death Row's first major project, Dr. Dre's debut solo album, ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992), made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. Its lead single, \"[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]]\" (featuring Snoop Dogg), peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], while its third, [[Let Me Ride]]\" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]] at the [[36th Annual Grammy Awards]]. That same year, he produced Death Row labelmate [[Snoop Dogg]]'s debut album ''[[Doggystyle]]'', and mentored producers such as his stepbrother [[Warren G]] (leading to the multi-platinum debut ''[[Regulate... G Funk Era]]'' in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's cousin [[Daz Dillinger]] (leading to the double-platinum debut ''[[Dogg Food]]'' by [[Tha Dogg Pound]] in 1995). In 1996, Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment; his compilation album, ''[[Dr. Dre Presents: The Aftermath]]'' (1996) and second studio album, ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'' (1999) followed thereafter.\n\nDuring the 2000s, Dr. Dre shifted focus onto production for other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. He signed [[Eminem]] in 1998 and [[50 Cent]] in 2002, while extensively contributing to releases by both artists. Aftermath has since signed other artists including [[The Game (rapper)|the Game]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Anderson .Paak]], [[Silk Sonic]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], and [[Rakim]], among others. He has won seven [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Producer of the Year, Non-Classical]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him number 56 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]. Outside of music, Dre has acted in films such as ''[[Set It Off (film)|Set It Off]]'', ''[[The Wash (2001 film)|The Wash]]'', and ''[[Training Day]]''.\n\nAccusations of Dr. Dre's violence against women have been widely publicized. In 1991 he pled [[no contest]] to his assault of television host [[Dee Barnes]], for which he was given two years' [[probation]]; a related civil suit was settled out of court. In 2015, ex-partner [[Michel'le]] accused him of [[domestic violence]]. Another of his ex-partners made further accusations, and was granted a [[restraining order]] against him. Former labelmate [[Tairrie B]] claimed that Dre assaulted her at a party in 1990. Following the release of his third album, [[Compton (album)|''Compton'']] (2015), he issued a public apology.",
