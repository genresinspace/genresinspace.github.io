  "name": "Josephine Foster",
  "description": "'''Josephine Foster'''  is an American singer, songwriter, and musician from [[Colorado]]. She is known for her anachronistic voice and work that weaves older styles with the modern, escaping simple classification.\n\nAs a teenager, Foster worked as a church singer and aspired to become an opera singer.  She moved to Chicago in 1998 to further her opera studies, and began home-recording her songs, resulting in the albums ''There Are Eyes Above'', influenced by [[Tin Pan Alley]], and an album of children's songs, ''Little Life''.  She then released collaborative albums with local folk bands The Children's Hour (''SOS JFK''), Born Heller (''S/T''), as well as ''[[All the Leaves Are Gone]]'', a psychedelic rock album with backing band The Supposed.\n\nA number of solo records followed, including the all acoustic ''[[Hazel Eyes, I Will Lead You]]'', an unorthodox collection of 19th century German [[Lied]]er titled ''[[A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (Josephine Foster album)|A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing]]'', and ''[[This Coming Gladness]]'', a psychedelic folk-rock album.\n\nFoster released most of her recordings the following decade with [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]], including ''Graphic as a Star'', her settings of 27 [[Emily Dickinson]] poems.\n\nThereafter she began to record frequently with engineer Andrija Tokic, who co-produced with Foster her solo albums ''Blood Rushing'', ''I'm A Dreamer'', and ''[[Faithful Fairy Harmony]]''; also ''More Amor'', a psych-folk album by her new band Mendrugo formed with Victor Herrero.  The latter was Foster's first foray into writing lyrics in Spanish.\n\nThe title song from ''I'm A Dreamer'' was featured in Season 2, episode 7 of the British television show ''[[The End of the F***ing World]]''.\n\nFoster also lent her voice to the soundtrack for the 2020 film, ''[[The World to Come]],'' and sung (as well as co-wrote) the titular song over the end credits.",
