Formed in 1995, the band has split up and reformed three times leaving drummer Brad Fincher as the only original member. The current lineup is Fincher, vocalist Ruben Rosas, guitarist Chris Andrews and bassist Dave Spencer. The band is currently signed to [[Relapse Records]], and was previously signed to Brutal Bands, United Guttural and Corpse Gristle Records. Devourment has also had albums re-released by other labels.\n\nSince the band's foundation, Devourment released a demo, ''Impaled'', and an album, ''Molesting the Decapitated'', before disbanding due to the jailing of vocalist Ruben Rosas. There was a brief reformation of the band during his incarceration, which saw the initial release of the compilation album ''[[1.3.8.]]'', and a brief reformation upon his release in 2002. The band reformed for a third time in 2005, and has since released two reissues of ''1.3.8.'', two DVDs, and four full-length albums: ''Butcher the Weak'', ''[[Unleash the Carnivore]]'', ''[[Conceived in Sewage]]'' and ''Obscene Majesty''.",
