After their debut album ''[[Experience (The Prodigy album)|Experience]]'' (1992), the band moved from their rave roots and incorporated [[techno]] and [[breakbeat]] influences on their follow-up, the critically acclaimed ''[[Music for the Jilted Generation]]'' (1994). They reached their commercial and critical peak with their third studio album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]'' (1997), which went to No. 1 in 16 countries, including the UK and the US, and spawned the UK number one singles \"[[Firestarter (Prodigy song)|Firestarter]]\" and \"[[Breathe (Prodigy song)|Breathe]]\" in 1996. The third single, \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", was a UK top ten hit and generated considerable controversy over its suggestive lyrics and music video. Thornhill left the band in 2000 and Flint died in 2019; Howlett and Maxim are the only two original members.\n\nThe Prodigy are one of the most successful electronic groups of all time, selling an estimated 25 million records worldwide including over 4.7 million albums in the UK.
