  "description": "'''The Prodigy''' are an English [[electronic music]] band formed in [[Braintree, Essex]], in 1990 by producer, keyboardist, and songwriter [[Liam Howlett]]. The original line-up also featured\n[[Rapping|MC]] and vocalist [[Maxim (musician)|Maxim]], dancer and  occasionally live keyboardist [[Leeroy Thornhill]], \ndancer Sharky, and dancer and vocalist [[Keith Flint]]. They describe their style as [[Electropunk|electronic punk]].\n\nThe band emerged during the underground [[rave]] scene and achieved early success in 1991 with their debut singles \"[[Charly (song)|Charly]]\" and \"[[Everybody in the Place]]\", which reached the UK top five. After their debut album ''[[Experience (The Prodigy album)|Experience]]'' (1992), the band moved from their rave roots and incorporated [[techno]], [[breakbeat]], and rock influences on their follow-up, the critically acclaimed ''[[Music for the Jilted Generation]]'' (1994). They reached their commercial and critical peak with their third studio album ''[[The Fat of the Land]]'' (1997), which went to No. 1 in 16 countries, including the UK and the US, and spawned the UK number one singles \"[[Firestarter (Prodigy song)|Firestarter]]\" and \"[[Breathe (Prodigy song)|Breathe]]\" in 1996. The third single, \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", was a UK top ten hit and generated considerable controversy over its suggestive lyrics and music video. Thornhill left the band in 2000 and Flint died in 2019; Howlett and Maxim are the only two original members.\n\nThe Prodigy are one of the most successful electronic groups of all time, selling an estimated 25 million records worldwide including over 4.7 million albums in the UK. They have scored seven consecutive UK number one albums. [[AllMusic]] described them as \"the premiere dance act for the alternative masses\" and \"the Godfathers of Rave\". The Prodigy have won many awards during their career, including two [[Brit Awards]] for Best British Dance Act, three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], two [[Kerrang! Awards]], five [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], and two [[Grammy Award]] nominations.",
