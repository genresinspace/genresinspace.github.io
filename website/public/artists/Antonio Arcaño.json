  "description": "'''Antonio Arcaño Betancourt''' (Atarés, [[Havana]] 29 December 1911 – 1994) was a Cuban [[flautist]], bandleader and founder of [[Arcaño y sus Maravillas]], one of Cuba's most successful [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]s. He retired from playing in 1945, but continued as director of the group until its dissolution in 1958. Despite his early retirement due to health problems, he is considered one of the most influential flautists in Cuba.\n\nAfter leaving La Maravilla del Siglo, a very popular charanga, Arcaño founded La Maravilla de Arcaño, later known as Arcaño y sus Maravillas. The band featured the López brothers, [[Cachao|Israel López \"Cachao\"]] and [[Orestes López]], composers and multi-instrumentalists that originated the [[danzón-mambo]], the direct precursor of the [[mambo (music)|mambo]], through compositions such as \"[[Chanchullo|Rareza de Melitón]]\", \"Se va el matancero\" and, above all, \"[[Mambo (1938 song)|Mambo]]\", the piece that lent its name to the genre. Arcaño was posthumously inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]] in 2000.",
