The band formed in 1980 with the line-up of [[Matthew Bannister (musician)|Matthew Bannister]] (guitar & vocals), David Pine (guitar & vocals), Kat Tyrie (bass guitar & vocals) and Martin Durrant (drums & vocals). Tyrie was replaced by John Kelcher in 1984. Durrant was temporarily replaced by [[Ross Burge]] in 1988 for the band's second tour of Europe.\n\nSneaky Feelings are unusual among [[Dunedin sound]] bands in that all four members of the band sing and write songs. The jangle sound of the guitars and layered vocals drew their influence from the music of [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beatles]], and comparisons can be made with some of California's [[Paisley Underground]] bands.\n\nThe band's name comes from a song by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Sneaky Feelings\", which is on his first album ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (1977).",
