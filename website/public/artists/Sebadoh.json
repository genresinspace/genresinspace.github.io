  "description": "'''Sebadoh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|b|ə|d|oʊ}}) is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in 1986 in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], by [[Eric Gaffney]] and [[Lou Barlow]], with multi-instrumentalist [[Jason Loewenstein]] completing the line-up in 1989. Barlow co-created Sebadoh as an outlet for his songwriting when [[J. Mascis]] gradually took over creative control of [[Dinosaur Jr.]], in which Barlow plays bass guitar.\n\nAlong with such bands as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Beat Happening]] and [[Guided by Voices]], Sebadoh helped pioneer a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] style of [[indie rock]] characterized by low-fidelity recording techniques that employed [[Multitrack recording|four-track]] [[cassette tape]] machines. The band's early output, such as ''[[The Freed Man]]'' and ''[[Weed Forestin']]'' (both released 1990), as well as ''[[Sebadoh III]]'' (1991), was typical of this style.  Following the release of ''[[Bubble & Scrape]]'' in 1993, Gaffney left the band. His replacement and erstwhile stand-in, Bob Fay, appeared on ''[[Bakesale]]'' (1994) and ''[[Harmacy]]'' (1996), but was fired before the sessions for the band's major label release ''[[The Sebadoh ]]'' (1999), featuring drummer [[Russ Pollard]].\n\nThe band then went on a 14-year recording hiatus, during which time members pursued other projects while occasionally touring as Sebadoh. The group, fronted by Barlow and now featuring drummer [[Bob D'Amico]], returned in 2012 with the ''[[Secret (EP)|Secret EP]]'' and, in 2013, a full-length album titled ''[[Defend Yourself]]'', which were both self-recorded. The album ''[[Act Surprised]]'' followed in 2019.",
