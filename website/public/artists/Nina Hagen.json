  "description": "'''Catharina''' \"'''Nina'''\" '''Hagen''' ({{IPA|de|ˈniːna ˈhaːɡn̩|lang|De-Nina Hagen.ogg}}; born 11 March 1955) is a German singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her theatrical vocals and rise to prominence during the [[Punk subculture|punk]] and [[Neue Deutsche Welle]] movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She is known as \"The Godmother of German Punk\".\n\nBorn and raised in the former [[East Berlin]], [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]], Hagen began her career as an actress when she appeared in several German films alongside her mother [[Eva-Maria Hagen]]. Around that same time, she joined the band Automobil and released the [[Schlager music|schlager]] single \"[[Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen]]\". After her stepfather [[Wolf Biermann]]'s East German citizenship was withdrawn in 1976, Hagen followed him to [[Hamburg]]. Shortly afterwards, she was offered a record deal from [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] and formed the [[Nina Hagen Band]]. Their [[Nina Hagen Band (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in late 1978 to critical acclaim and was a commercial success selling over 250,000 copies. The band released one more album, ''[[Unbehagen]]'', before their break-up in 1979.\n\nIn 1982, Hagen signed a new contract with CBS and released her debut solo album ''[[NunSexMonkRock]]'', which became her first record to chart in the United States. She followed it with two more albums: ''[[Angstlos|Fearless]]'' (1983) and ''[[Nina Hagen in Ekstasy]]'' (1985), before her contract with CBS expired and was not renewed. In 1989, she was offered a record deal from [[Mercury Records]]. She released three albums on the label: ''[[Nina Hagen (album)|Nina Hagen]]'' (1989), ''[[Street (Nina Hagen album)|Street]]'' (1991), and ''[[Revolution Ballroom]]'' (1993). However, none of the albums achieved notable commercial success. Hagen made her musical comeback with the release of her album ''[[Return of the Mother]]'' (2000).\n\nBesides her musical career, Hagen is also a [[Voice acting|voice-over actress]].
