  "name": "Magma",
  "description": "'''Magma''' is a French [[progressive rock]] band founded in Paris in 1969 by self-taught drummer [[Christian Vander (musician)|Christian Vander]], who claimed as his inspiration a \"vision of humanity's spiritual and ecological future\" that profoundly disturbed him. The style of progressive rock that Vander developed with Magma is termed \"[[Zeuhl]]\", and has been applied to other bands in France operating in the same period, and to some recent Japanese bands.\n\nVander created a [[fictional language]], [[#Kobaïan|Kobaïan]], in which most lyrics are sung. In a 1977 interview with Vander and long-time Magma vocalist Klaus Blasquiz, Blasquiz said that Kobaïan is a \"phonetic language made by elements of the Slavonic and Germanic languages to be able to express some things musically. The language has of course a content, but not word by word.\" Vander himself has said, \"When I wrote, the sounds [of Kobaïan] came naturally with it—I didn't intellectualise the process by saying 'Ok, now I'm going to write some words in a particular language', it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music.\" In the course of their first album, the band tells the story of a group of people fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the planet Kobaïa. Subsequently, conflict arises when the Kobaïans - descendants of the original colonists - encounter other Earth refugees. Later albums tell different stories set in more ancient times; however, the Kobaïan language remains an integral part of the music.\n\nIn 1986, the French label Seventh Records was founded to (re-)publish Magma's and Vander's work. Over the years, Seventh has also released albums by related artists such as [[Stella Vander]], Patrick Gauthier, and Collectif Mu.",
