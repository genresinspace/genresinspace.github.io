  "name": "Andrew Eldritch",
  "description": "'''Andrew Eldritch''' (born '''Andrew William Harvey Taylor''', 15 May 1959) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He is the lead vocalist and only remaining original member of [[the Sisters of Mercy]], a band that emerged from the British [[post-punk]] scene, transformed into a [[gothic rock]] band, and, in later years, flirted with [[hard rock]].\n\nFormerly a drummer, Eldritch also programs the tracks for the Sisters of Mercy's [[drum machine]] (known as \"Doktor Avalanche\") and plays guitars and keyboards in its studio recordings but uses live shows to focus solely on his vocal performance. Eldritch is well known for his deep and melancholic [[bass-baritone]] singing voice as well as his poetic (and sometimes politically charged) lyrics.\n\nThe Sisters of Mercy is regarded as a major influence on gothic rock, and Eldritch, with his (former) shock of black hair, [[bass-baritone]] vocal style and pale and thin look (with prominent cheekbones), was described in the media as a poster boy for the genre, earning him the label \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#E|the Godfather of Goth]]\", which he frequently rejects.\n\nHe also established the record label [[Merciful Release]]. In addition to the Sisters of Mercy, in 1986 Andrew Eldritch established a side-project, [[the Sisterhood (gothic rock band)|the Sisterhood]], which was quickly abandoned in favour of continuing working under the Sisters of Mercy.",
