  "description": "'''Hooverphonic''' is a Belgian [[Electronic music|electronic]] band that was formed in October 1995. Though originally categorized as a [[trip hop]] group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where it could no longer be described as a belonging to a single genre, but rather as encompassing [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[electronica]], [[electropop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and a mixture of others. The band was originally named '''Hoover''', but was later renamed Hooverphonic to avoid confusion with bands already using the Hoover name, and a possible legal copyright problem with the [[The Hoover Company|vacuum cleaner company]].\n\nSince their formation, Hooverphonic's lineup consisted of bassist [[Alex Callier]], guitarist Raymond Geerts, and various lead singers. Prominent ones included [[Liesje Sadonius]] (1996–1997), [[Geike Arnaert]] (1997–2008, 2020–present), [[Noémie Wolfs]] (2010–2015), and Luka Cruysberghs (2018–2020).\n\nThe band were set to represent {{Esccnty|Belgium|y=2020}} at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020]] in [[Rotterdam]] with their song \"[[Release Me (Hooverphonic song)|Release Me]]\". However, on March 18, 2020, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They instead represented Belgium in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021]] with the song \"[[The Wrong Place]]\".",
