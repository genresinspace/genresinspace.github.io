  "name": "Boxcutter",
  "description": "'''Boxcutter''' is the pseudonym for '''Barry Lynn''' (born 1980), an electronic musician from Northern Ireland. Early Boxcutter material from 2005 and 2006, like that released on [[Hotflush Recordings]] and on the debut [[Planet Mu]] album [[Oneiric (album)|Oneiric]], was frequently associated with the genre [[dubstep]], although it was also compared to experimental artists such as [[Amon Tobin]] and [[Boards of Canada]]. The second Boxcutter album [[Glyphic (album)|Glyphic]] was more influenced by classic [[dub music]] such as [[King Tubby]], but also drew comparisons to artists such as [[Squarepusher]], [[Foul play (DJ)|Foul Play]] and [[Seefeel]], and continued Lynn's reputation for working outside of conventions and taking a genre-hopping approach. In 2009, Lynn released the [[SETI]]-themed album [[Arecibo Message (album)|Arecibo Message]]. In the same year, he also founded the Kinnego Records label, on which he released a collaboration with Kinnego Flux (a duo composed of David Baxter and Brian Greene) featuring artwork by London designers La Boca, and the first vinyl single by [[Space Dimension Controller]].\n\n[[The Dissolve (album)|The Dissolve]] was released in 2011 and scored 78 on Metacritic, with the BBC Review referencing [[Panda Bear (musician)|Panda Bear]] to describe a collaboration with vocalist Brian Greene, and reviewers remarking on the move away from dubstep sonics. Also in 2011, [[Adult Swim]] commissioned the track Waiting for the Lights for their [[Unclassified (Adult Swim album)|{Unclassified}]] compilation.\n\nBoxcutter released the Gnosis EP on [[Om Unit]]'s Cosmic Bridge label in December 2013.\n\nBoxcutter has also released music as The Host, including 2012's eponymous album on Planet Mu, and Esalen Lecures on Touch Sensitive Records in 2015. An album of material by Barry Lynn pre-dating the Boxcutter alias was released by Planet Mu in 2008, entitled Balancing Lakes, named after the balancing lakes in [[Craigavon, County Armagh|Craigavon]].\n\nBarry Lynn has collaborated with [[FaltyDL]] under the alias NeferTT, releasing the EP Blue Skies Red Soil in 2012 for Hotflush Recordings.\n\nBoxcutter has performed live across Europe and the US, including at [[Unsound Festival]], [[TodaysArt]], [[CTM Festival|Club Transmediale]], [[Bloc Festival]], and [[Decibel Festival]]. For live shows, Barry often accompanies his electronic music with live electric guitar or bass guitar.\n\nBarry Lynn is the son of the late [[Correspondence Chess]] [[International Master]] Liam Lynn.\n\nLynn has a PhD in [[Astrophysics]] from [[Queen's University Belfast]] and has published research papers for [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]].",
