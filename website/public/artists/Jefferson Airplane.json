One of the pioneering bands of [[psychedelic rock]], the group defined the [[San Francisco Sound]] and was the first from the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] to achieve international commercial success. They headlined the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] (1967), [[Woodstock]] (1969), [[Altamont Free Concert]] (1969), and the first [[Isle of Wight Festival]] (1968) in England. Their 1967 breakout album ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]'' was one of the most significant recordings of the [[Summer of Love]]. Two songs from that album, \"[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]\" and \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\", are among ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nThe October 1966 to February 1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane, consisting of [[Marty Balin]] (vocals), [[Paul Kantner]] (guitar, vocals), [[Grace Slick]] (vocals, keyboards), [[Jorma Kaukonen]] (lead guitar, vocals), [[Jack Casady]] (bass), and [[Spencer Dryden]] (drums), was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996. Balin left the band in 1971. After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full-time to their own band, [[Hot Tuna]]. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as [[Jefferson Starship]] in 1974, with Balin eventually joining them. Jefferson Airplane received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2016.",
