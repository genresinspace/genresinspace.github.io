The label released his debut studio album, ''[[Remember My Name (album)|Remember My Name]]'' (2015), and its follow-up, ''[[Lil Durk 2X]]'' (2016), to moderate commercial reception before parting ways with the rapper in 2018.\n\nFollowing the independent release of his ''Just Cause Y'all Waited'' mixtape in March 2018, Banks signed with [[Alamo Records]] in July of that year.

He closed the year with his sixth album, ''[[The Voice (Lil Durk album)|The Voice]]'' (2020), which peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Released the following year, his collaborative album with rapper Lil Baby, ''[[The Voice of the Heroes]]'' (2021), became his first to debut atop the chart. His seventh album, ''[[7220]]'' (2022) became his second to do so, while his eighth album, ''[[Almost Healed]]'' (2023), peaked at number three and was led by the single \"[[All My Life (Lil Durk song)|All My Life]]\" (featuring [[J. Cole]]), which also peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and won [[Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance|Best Melodic Rap Performance]] at the [[66th Annual Grammy Awards]], yielding his furthest commercial success.\n\nBanks is a four-time Grammy Award nominee. He founded the Chicago-based collective and record label [[Only the Family]] (OTF) in 2010, which included late rapper [[King Von]].
