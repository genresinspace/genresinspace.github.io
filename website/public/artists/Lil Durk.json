He closed the year with his sixth album, ''[[The Voice (Lil Durk album)|The Voice]]'' (2020), which peaked at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Released the following year, his collaborative album with rapper Lil Baby, ''[[The Voice of the Heroes]]'' (2021), became his first to debut atop the chart.

Cole]]), which also peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and won [[Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance|Best Melodic Rap Performance]] at the [[66th Annual Grammy Awards]], yielding his furthest commercial success.\n\nBanks is a four-time Grammy Award nominee and one-time winner.
