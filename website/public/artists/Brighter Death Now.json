  "description": "'''Brighter Death Now''' is the artist name under which Roger Karmanik (b. 1965 as Roger Karlsson), the founder of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] record label [[Cold Meat Industry]], releases [[death industrial]], [[power electronics (music)|power electronics]] and [[dark ambient]] music.\n\nWhereas early Brighter Death Now recordings tended to be largely instrumental and atmospherically oriented, present-day releases often feature screamed vocals, distorted beyond comprehension. Throughout its history, Karmanik has kept his music's thematic elements focused on such topics as child molestation, sadism, and psychosis.\n\nThe ''Great Death'' trilogy and ''May All Be Dead'' have become rare collectors items, and are sought after by many Brighter Death Now fans. Roger Karmanik has been active under other names such as ''Lille Roger'' (Swedish for Little Roger) and ''Bomb The Daynursery''.\n\nIn 2009, Karmanik remixed the short films of [[Jason LaRay Keener]] as projection for live shows.\n\nKarmanik closed down Cold Meat Industries around the beginning of 2014 as he expressed that he was suffering mentally and physically from the stress of running the label. By the end of 2014, Karmanik had fully immersed himself within the shroud of Brighter Death Now and announced the creation of his new label Familjegraven whose sole purpose is to release his own projects, including rarities, reissues, and new recordings.",
