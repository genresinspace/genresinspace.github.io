  "description": "'''Ronald Shannon Jackson''' (January 12, 1940 – October 19, 2013) was an American jazz drummer from Fort Worth, Texas. A pioneer of avant-garde jazz, free funk, and jazz fusion, he appeared on over 50 albums as a bandleader, sideman, arranger, and producer. Jackson and bassist [[Sirone (musician)|Sirone]] are the only musicians to have performed and recorded with the three prime shapers of [[free jazz]]: pianist [[Cecil Taylor]], and saxophonists [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Albert Ayler]].\n\n''Musician, Player and Listener'' magazine writers David Breskin and [[Rafi Zabor]] called him \"the most stately free-jazz drummer in the history of the idiom, a regal and thundering presence.\" [[Gary Giddins]] wrote \"Jackson is an astounding drummer, as everyone agrees...he has emerged as a kind of all-purpose new-music connoisseur who brings a profound and unshakably individual approach to every playing situation.\"\n\nIn 1979, he founded his own group, the Decoding Society, playing what has been dubbed [[free funk]]: a blend of [[funk]] [[rhythm]] and [[free jazz]] improvisation.",
