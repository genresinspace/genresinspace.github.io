  "description": "'''Holocaust''' are a Scottish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band founded in 1977 and based in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe band's lineup is John Mortimer guitar and vocals, Scott Wallace drums and Mark McGrath bass. The original lineup featured guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, vocalist Gary Lettice, bassist Robin Begg and drummer Nick Brockie. In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the moniker Hologram. Holocaust was one of the Scottish bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s, deviating from the more commercial [[new wave music]] of the day, and combining earlier metal with the tempo and attitude of [[punk rock]].{{cn|date=October 2023}}\n\nThe John Mortimer-led Holocaust incorporated many [[progressive metal]], [[thrash metal]] and [[post-punk]] influences into its sound, releasing complex pieces such as the \"Sound of Souls\" [[Extended play|EP]] and [[concept album]] ''Covenant''. The band's three-piece lineup has remained the same since 2003, releasing the EP \"Expander\" and the album ''Predator'' in 2015, and most recently the album \"Elder Gods\" in 2019.\n\nHolocaust's song, \"The Small Hours\", was covered by  [[Metallica]] in 1987 and released on their ''[[The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited]]'' EP, and reappeared on their 1998 compilation album ''[[Garage Inc.]]''\n\nIn 1996, Holocaust recorded a cover of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" for the compilation ''[[Metal Militia: A Tribute To Metallica II]]''.",
