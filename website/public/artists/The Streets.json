The project was founded in the early 90s in [[Birmingham]], while Skinner was still a teenager; however, no music would formally eventuate until the early 2000s. In the initial run of The Streets, the project released five studio albums: ''[[Original Pirate Material]]'' (2002), ''[[A Grand Don't Come for Free]]'' (2004), ''[[The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living]]'' (2006), ''[[Everything Is Borrowed]]'' (2008) and ''[[Computers and Blues]]'' (2011). The Streets also released a string of successful singles during this time, which reached the Top 40 on the [[UK Singles chart]] – including \"[[Has It Come to This?]]\", \"[[Fit but You Know It]]\", \"[[Dry Your Eyes]]\" (the project's only [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 2000s|number-one single]]), \"[[When You Wasn't Famous]]\" and \"[[Prangin' Out]]\". After disbanding The Streets in 2011, Skinner pursued several other musical projects before ultimately reviving the moniker in 2017. A mixtape, ''[[None of Us Are Getting Out of This Life Alive]]'', was released in 2020. The Streets' sixth studio album, ''[[The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light]]'', was released in September 2023.\n\nThe Streets is considered one of the most important and influential acts within the trajectory of hip-hop, [[UK garage|garage]] and [[grime music]] within the UK. In 2020, ''Pitchfork'' described ''Original Pirate Material'' as \"a landmark for [[UK rap]]\", while ''[[Dazed]]'' wrote in 2018 that the album \"soundtracked the beginning of a decade – recovering from the [[Britpop]] hangover and comedown from [[New Labour]] euphoria – but also defined it.\"",
