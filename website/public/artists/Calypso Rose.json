  "description": "'''Calypso Rose''' or '''Linda McCartha Monica Sandy-Lewis''' (born April 27, 1940, in Bethel Village, [[Tobago]]) is a [[Trinidad and Tobago]] [[calypsonian]]. She started writing songs at the age of 13; over the years, she has composed more than 1000 songs and recorded more than 20 albums. Considered the \"mother of [[Calypso music|calypso]]\", Rose was the first female calypso star and her lyrics frequently address social issues like racism and sexism. Her influence over the calypso music genre forced the renaming of the Calypso King competition to the Calypso Monarch instead. In addition to writing songs about social issues, Rose is also an activist and was given the title of UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for former child soldiers along with performing at numerous events for social change. She has received every award available to living artists in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nShe currently resides in [[Queens, New York]], and regularly returns to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in addition to touring.",
