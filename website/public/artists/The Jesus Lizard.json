  "description": "'''The Jesus Lizard''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1987 in [[Austin, Texas]] by vocalist [[David Yow]], guitarist [[Duane Denison]] and bassist [[David Wm. Sims]]. They relocated to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], in 1989, where they found kindred spirits in recording engineer [[Steve Albini]] and [[Touch and Go Records]]. With the addition of drummer [[Mac McNeilly]], they began performing live and became \"a leading [[noise rock]] band in the American independent [[underground music|underground]]â€¦[who] turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-[[industrial rock|industrial]] noise.\"  The albums ''[[Goat (album)|Goat]]'' (1991) and ''[[Liar (The Jesus Lizard album)|Liar]]'' (1992) have since been recognized as two of the most significant noise rock albums of their decade.\n\nDrummer [[Jim Kimball]] replaced McNeilly late in 1996, and was himself replaced by Brendan Murphy two years later, with McNeilly returning to drums for their reunion shows years later. Despite releasing a [[Puss/Oh, the Guilt|split single]] with leading alt-rockers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and signing to [[Capitol Records]], the band failed to find commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999. Their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics. The band performed another reunion tour in 2017 and 2019.",
