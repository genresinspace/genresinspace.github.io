  "description": "'''The Jesus Lizard''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1987 in [[Austin, Texas]] by vocalist [[David Yow]], guitarist [[Duane Denison]], and bassist [[David Wm. Sims]]. They relocated to [[Chicago]] in 1989 and began working with producer [[Steve Albini]] and [[Touch and Go Records]]. Adding drummer [[Mac McNeilly]], they became \"a leading [[noise rock]] band in the American independent [[underground music|underground]]…[who] turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-[[industrial rock|industrial]] noise.\"  The albums ''[[Goat (album)|Goat]]'' (1991) and ''[[Liar (The Jesus Lizard album)|Liar]]'' (1992) have since been recognized as two of the most significant noise rock albums of the era.\n\nDrummer [[Jim Kimball]] replaced McNeilly late in 1996 and was himself replaced by Brendan Murphy two years later. Despite releasing a [[Puss/Oh, the Guilt|split single]] with leading alt-rockers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and signing to [[Capitol Records]], the band did not achieve commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999. With returning drummer McNeilly, their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics. They performed further reunion tours beginning in 2017.",
