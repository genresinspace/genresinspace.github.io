With the loosening of restrictions on the performance of traditional works in the late 1970s, she broadened her repertory to include several of these pieces. In 1987 she emigrated to the United States, settling with her husband, [[Ding Mei Kui]], in [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]], [[Queens]], New York City.
