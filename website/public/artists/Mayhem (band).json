  "name": "Mayhem",
  "description": "'''Mayhem''' is a Norwegian [[black metal]] band formed in [[Oslo]] in 1984. They were one of the pioneers of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]], and their music has profoundly influenced the black metal genre. Mayhem's early career was marked by several controversies, including their notorious live performances, [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Dead's suicide|the 1991 suicide]] of vocalist [[Dead (musician)|Per Yngve Ohlin]] (\"Dead\"), and the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Murder of Euronymous|1993 murder]] of guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein Aarseth]] (\"Euronymous\") by former bassist [[Varg Vikernes]] (\"Count Grishnackh\") of [[Burzum]].\n\nThe group released a demo and an EP, that were highly influential and amassed a devoted following, through sporadic and notorious live performances, while attracting further attention due to their connections with the series of [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Church arsons and attempts|Norwegian church burnings]] and the incidents of violence surrounding them. Mayhem temporarily disbanded following Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which is regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members [[Jan Axel Blomberg]] (\"Hellhammer\"), [[Necrobutcher|Jørn Stubberud]] (\"Necrobutcher\"), and [[Sven Erik Kristiansen]] (\"Maniac\") reformed the band in 1995, with [[Rune Eriksen]] (\"Blasphemer\") replacing Aarseth. [[Attila Csihar]] and [[Teloch|Morten Iversen]] (\"Teloch\") have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively. Their post-Aarseth material is characterized by increased experimentation. The 2007 album ''[[Ordo Ad Chao]],'' received the [[Spellemannprisen|Spellemann Award]] for Best Heavy Metal Album.",
