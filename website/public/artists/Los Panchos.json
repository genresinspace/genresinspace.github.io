The trio became one of the leading exporters of the [[bolero]] and the romantic ballad in [[Latin America]]. \n\nThe group sold hundreds of millions of records since its creation in the mid 1940s, some of their best known songs being their interpretations of classic folk songs such as \"[[Bésame Mucho|Besame Mucho]]\", \"[[Sabor a Mí]]\", \"Sin Ti\", \"[[Solamente Una Vez]]\", \"Contigo\", \"[[Quizás, Quizás, Quizás|Quizas, Quizas, Quizas]]\", \"Contigo Aprendi\", \"[[Green Eyes (Aquellos Ojos Verdes)|Aquellos Ojos Verdes]]\", \"[[What a Diff'rence a Day Made|Cuando vuelva a tu lado]]\", \"[[Yellow Days|Se te olvida]]\", \"[[El reloj|El Reloj]]\", \"[[Noche de ronda|Noche de Ronda]]\", \"Rayito de Luna\".\n\nLos Panchos are regarded as one of the top musical trios of all time and one of the most influential Latin American artists of all time. They sold out concerts around the globe for over 70 years and have appeared in more than 50 films. \n\nA characteristic instrument of Los Panchos and other Mexican ''tríos románticos'' since the 1950s is the [[requinto guitar]], which is smaller and tuned higher than a standard guitar. Requinto solos are found in many bolero recordings by Los Panchos.",
