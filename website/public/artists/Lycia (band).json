  "description": "'''Lycia''' is an American [[dark wave]] band formed in 1988 in [[Tempe, Arizona]]. The main personnel of the band are [[Mike VanPortfleet]], [[Tara VanFlower]] and David Galas. Although only achieving minor cult success, the band is notable for being one of the ground breaking groups in darkwave and [[ethereal wave]] styles. Their 1995 album ''[[The Burning Circle and Then Dust]]'' received some attention for the [[power pop]] hit song \"Pray\" and \"remains a high point of American dark rock\", according to [[AllMusic]]. Lycia's music is characterized by rich soundscapes and layers of echoed guitars, dark and ethereal keyboards, doomy drum machine beats, VanPortfleet's melancholic, whispered vocals and Vanflower's vivid voice. [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Peter Steele]] are some of their more well-known fans.",
