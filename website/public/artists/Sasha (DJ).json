  "description": "'''Alexander Paul Coe''' (born 4 September 1969), known professionally as '''Sasha''',{{efn|name=a}} is a Welsh [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and record producer. He is best known for his live events and [[electronic music]] as a solo artist, as well as his collaborations with British DJ [[John Digweed]] as [[Sasha & John Digweed]]. He was voted as World No.⁠ ⁠1 DJ in 2000 in a poll conducted by ''[[DJ Magazine]]''. He is a four-time [[International Dance Music Awards]] winner, four-time [[List of DJ Awards winners and nominees|DJ Awards]] winner and [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominee.\n\nSasha began his career playing [[acid house]] music in the late 1980s. He partnered with John Digweed in 1993, touring internationally and producing a series of [[mix album]]s (compilations of other artists' work played in a continuous fashion).\n\nSasha has [[remix]]ed tracks for artists such as [[D-Ream]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Moby]], [[the Chemical Brothers]] and [[Hot Chip]]. Sasha's remixing and production often combine electronic music genres, making it difficult for critics to pinpoint his musical style. As well as remixes and compilation albums, Sasha has produced three albums of original works: ''[[The Qat Collection]]'' in 1994, ''[[Airdrawndagger]]'' in 2002, and ''[[Scene Delete]]'' in 2016.\n\nAfter achieving success as a producer and DJ, Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as [[BT (musician)|BT]] and [[James Zabiela]]. His use of live [[audio engineering]] equipment helped popularise technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on [[gramophone record|records]] and [[phonograph|turntables]]. In 2007, he formed a record label with [[Renaissance Records]] called [[emFire]], which is the exclusive outlet for his new music.",
