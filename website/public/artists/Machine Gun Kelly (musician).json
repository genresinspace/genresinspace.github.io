  "description": "'''Colson Baker'''{{efn|name=Richard}} (born April 22, 1990), known professionally as '''MGK''' (stylized in all lowercase) and formerly '''Machine Gun Kelly''', is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor.\n\nMGK released four [[mixtape]]s from 2007 to 2010 before he signed with [[Sean Combs|Puff Daddy]]'s [[Bad Boy Records]], an imprint of [[Interscope Records]], in 2011. His debut studio album, ''[[Lace Up]]'' (2012), peaked at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was led by the single \"[[Wild Boy (song)|Wild Boy]]\" (featuring [[Waka Flocka Flame]]), which marked his first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and received [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). His second and third albums, ''[[General Admission (Machine Gun Kelly album)|General Admission]]'' (2015) and ''[[Bloom (Machine Gun Kelly album)|Bloom]]'' (2017), were both met with critical praise and similar commercial success; the latter was supported by the single \"[[Bad Things (Machine Gun Kelly and Camila Cabello song)|Bad Things]]\" (with [[Camila Cabello]]), which peaked at number four on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. His 2018 single, \"[[Rap Devil]]\", was a diss track aimed at fellow rapper [[Eminem]], and peaked at number 13 on the chart despite mixed critical response. His fourth album, ''[[Hotel Diablo]]'' (2019), experimented with [[rap rock]] and saw a critical incline.\n\nMGK's fifth album, ''[[Tickets to My Downfall]]'' (2020), saw a complete departure from hip-hop in favor of a [[pop punk|pop-punk]] sound and aesthetic, with its production entirely helmed by [[Blink-182]] drummer [[Travis Barker]]. It debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200—becoming the only rock album to do so that year—and was supported by the single \"[[My Ex's Best Friend]]\" (featuring [[Blackbear (musician)|blackbear]]), which peaked within the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Its sequel, ''[[Mainstream Sellout]]'' (2022), served as his sixth album and matched its commercial success, although critical reception was mixed. In 2024, he released the collaborative [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[Genre: Sadboy]]'' with fellow Ohio-based rapper [[Trippie Redd]].\n\nMGK had his first starring role in the romantic drama ''[[Beyond the Lights]]'' (2014), and since appeared in the [[techno-thriller]] ''[[Nerve (2016 film)|Nerve]]'' (2016), the horror ''[[Bird Box (film)|Bird Box]]'' (2018), the comedy ''[[Big Time Adolescence]]'' and portrayed [[Tommy Lee]] in the [[Mötley Crüe]] biopic ''[[The Dirt (film)|The Dirt]]'' (both 2019). In 2022, he and [[Mod Sun]] made their directorial debuts with the [[Stoner film|stoner]] [[comedy film]] ''[[Good Mourning (film)|Good Mourning]]'', which they also wrote, produced, and starred in.\n\nThe stage name \"Machine Gun Kelly\" is derived from the nickname of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition-era]] gangster [[Machine Gun Kelly (gangster)|George Kelly Barnes]].",
