After the departure of Lancaster and Binns, as well as the recruitment of bassist Sam Bettley in 2009, the band released their debut album ''[[Stand Up and Scream]]'' (2009). The band released two studio albums ''[[Reckless & Relentless]]'' (2011) and ''[[From Death to Destiny]]'' (2013), before the departure of Worsnop in January 2015. He was replaced by [[Denis Stoff]] and the band released ''[[The Black (Asking Alexandria album)|The Black]]'' (2016). Stoff departed from the band in October that year, and Worsnop subsequently returned to the band. The band released their [[Asking Alexandria (album)|self-titled]] fifth album in late 2017, which was a marked stylistic departure from their previous works. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Like a House on Fire]]'', which was released in 2020, showed the group's continuity of a more straightforward and melodic [[hard rock]] sound, while also shifting into different genres. Its follow-up and their seventh studio album, ''[[See What's on the Inside]]'', was released in 2021. Their eighth studio album, ''[[Where Do We Go from Here? (Asking Alexandria album)|Where Do We Go from Here?]]'', was released in 2023.",
