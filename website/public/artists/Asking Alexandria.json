  "description": "'''Asking Alexandria'''  are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Dubai|Dubai, United Arab Emirates]] before relocating to [[York|York, North Yorkshire]]. The band's current line-up is composed of guitarist Cameron Liddell, drummer James Cassells, vocalist [[Danny Worsnop]], and bassist Sam Bettley.\n\nInitially formed in 2003 by guitarist [[Ben Bruce]], the band officially established its best-known formation in 2009 with a line-up consisting of Bruce, Worsnop, Cassells, Liddell and Bettley. This line-up released three albums – ''[[Stand Up and Scream]]'' (2009), ''[[Reckless & Relentless]]'' (2011), and ''[[From Death to Destiny]]'' (2013) – before the departure of Worsnop in January 2015. He was replaced by [[Denis Stoff]], and the band released ''[[The Black (Asking Alexandria album)|The Black]]'' (2016). Stoff departed from the band in October that year, and Worsnop subsequently returned to the band. The band released their [[Asking Alexandria (album)|self-titled]] sixth album in late 2017, which was a marked stylistic departure from their previous works. Their seventh studio album, ''[[Like a House on Fire]]'', which was released in 2020, showed the group's continuity of a more straightforward and melodic [[hard rock]] sound, while also shifting into different genres. Its follow-up and their eighth studio album, ''[[See What's on the Inside]]'', was released in 2021. Their ninth studio album, ''[[Where Do We Go from Here? (Asking Alexandria album)|Where Do We Go from Here?]]'', was released in 2023.",
