After a string of collaborations and film soundtrack contributions from 2013 and 2014, Tesfaye began combining his signature alternative R&B sound with a more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented approach on his second and third studio albums, ''[[Beauty Behind the Madness]]'' (2015) and ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'' (2016); both debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] while spawning the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[Can't Feel My Face]]\", \"[[The Hills (song)|The Hills]]\", \"[[Starboy (song)|Starboy]]\", and \"[[Die for You (The Weeknd song)|Die for You]]\".\n\nHe returned to a more alternative R&B-dominated soundscape for his debut [[extended play]], ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]'' (2018), which included the US top-ten single \"[[Call Out My Name]]\". He started making an album trilogy named after three chronologic time points and explored the [[dream pop]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] genres with the trilogy's first installment and fourth studio album, ''[[After Hours (The Weeknd album)|After Hours]]'' (2020), which spawned the chart-topping singles \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\" and \"[[Save Your Tears]]\", as well as \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", which became the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Top 10 songs of all time (1958–2021)|best-performing song in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100's history]] and the longest-charting song at the time.

In 2023, he co-created and starred in the [[HBO]] drama series ''[[The Idol (TV series)|The Idol]]'', which drew [[The Weeknd#The Idol allegations|significant controversy]] and was received as a critical failure.
