  "name": "Robert Wyatt",
  "description": "'''Robert Wyatt''' (born 28 January 1945) is an English retired musician. A founding member of the influential [[Canterbury scene]] bands [[Soft Machine]] and [[Matching Mole]], he was initially a kit drummer and singer before becoming [[paraplegic]] following an accidental fall from a window in 1973, which led him to abandon band work, explore other instruments, and begin a 40-year solo career.\n\nA key player during the formative years of British [[jazz fusion]], [[psychedelia]] and [[progressive rock]], Wyatt's own work became increasingly interpretative, collaborative and politicised from the mid-1970s onwards. His solo music has covered a particularly individual musical terrain ranging from covers of [[pop music|pop]] [[single (music)|singles]] to shifting, amorphous song collections drawing on elements of [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[nursery rhyme]].\n\nWyatt retired from his music career in 2014, stating \"there is a pride in [stopping], I don't want [the music] to go off.\" He is married to English painter and songwriter [[Alfreda Benge]].",
