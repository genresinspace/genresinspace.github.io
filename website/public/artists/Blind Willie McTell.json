  "name": "Blind Willie McTell",
  "description": "'''Blind Willie McTell''' (born '''William Samuel McTier'''; May 5, 1898 â€“ August 19, 1959) was an American [[Piedmont blues]] and [[ragtime]] singer, songwriter and guitarist. He played in a fluid, syncopated [[finger picking]] guitar style common among many East Coast, Piedmont blues players. Like his Atlanta contemporaries, he came to use [[twelve-string guitar]]s exclusively. McTell was also adept at [[slide guitar]], unusual among ragtime bluesmen. He sang in a smooth and often laid-back [[tenor]] which differed greatly from the harsher voices of many [[Delta blues]]men such as [[Charley Patton]]. He performed in various musical styles including blues, ragtime, [[Gospel music|religious music]], and [[hokum]] and recorded more than 120 titles during fourteen recording sessions.\n\nHe was born William Samuel McTier in the Happy Valley community outside [[Thomson, Georgia]]. In his recordings of \"Lay Some Flowers on My Grave\", \"Lord, Send Me an Angel\" and \"Statesboro Blues\", he pronounces his surname ''MacTell'' with the stress on the first syllable. He learned to play the guitar in his early teens from his mother and from relatives and neighbors in Statesboro where his family had moved. He was a popular performer on the streets of several Georgia cities, including [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and [[Atlanta]] where he made his first recordings, eight songs, for [[Victor Records]] in 1927 including \"Statesboro Blues.\" . He never had a major [[hit record]] but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and '30s.  McTell was active in the 1940s and '50s playing at house rent parties, on street corners, at fish fries, on the medicine and tent show circuit, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime friend, [[Curley Weaver]] as well as hoboing through the South and East. He made his last recordings in 1956 at an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner. He died three years later, having lived for years with diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and '50s. He did not live to see the [[American folk music revival]] when many other bluesmen were rediscovered.",
