She is best known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-song contributions to [[Square Enix]] and [[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney]]'s collaborative video game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'': \"[[Hikari (Hikaru Utada song)|Simple and Clean]]\", \"[[Passion (Hikaru Utada song)|Sanctuary]]\", \"[[Chikai (Hikaru Utada song)|Don't Think Twice]]\", and \"[[Face My Fears]]\".\n\nUtada was born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer [[Teruzane Utada]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[enka]]}} singer [[Keiko Fuji]]. She began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo as a result of her father's job. After signing to [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]], she released her English-language debut album ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' under the name '''Cubic U''' in 1998, which was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, Utada released her Japanese-language debut, ''[[First Love (Hikaru Utada album)|First Love]]'', which was an immediate success. Backed by the success of singles \"[[Automatic (Hikaru Utada song)|Automatic]]\", \"[[Time Will Tell (Hikaru Utada song)|Time Will Tell]]\", and \"[[Movin' On Without You]]\", the album sold two&nbsp;million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the [[Oricon]] charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six&nbsp;million more throughout the rest of 1999. ''First Love'' eventually became Japan's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] of all time.\n\nUtada's album ''[[Distance (Hikaru Utada album)|Distance]]'' was released in early 2001 and spawned her biggest singles—\"[[Addicted to You (Hikaru Utada song)|Addicted to You]]\", \"[[Wait & See (Risk)]]\" and \"[[Can You Keep a Secret? (song)|Can You Keep a Secret?]]\"—which became million-sellers. The album broke several sales records after three&nbsp;million copies were sold in its first week, instantly becoming Japan's [[Lists of fastest-selling albums#Japan|fastest-selling album]]. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as [[Traveling (song)|Traveling]], [[Hikari (Hikaru Utada song)|Hikari]] and [[Sakura Drops]], ''[[Deep River (Hikaru Utada album)|Deep River]]'', which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and became one of Japan's top-selling records of all time. The albums ''[[Exodus (Hikaru Utada album)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Ultra Blue]]'' and ''[[Heart Station]]'' also sold millions of copies. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released the acoustic-driven albums ''[[Fantôme (album)|Fantôme]]'' (2016) and ''[[Hatsukoi (Hikaru Utada album)|Hatsukoi]]'' (2018), which reached number one on the Oricon albums chart. She topped the charts again with 2022's ''[[Bad Mode]]'', her first Japanese/English album.\n\nBy the end of the 2000s, Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by ''[[The Japan Times]]''. She is one of Japan's [[List of best-selling music artists in Japan|top-selling recording artists]] of all time with over 40 million records sold. Twelve of her singles have reached number one on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]], while ten albums have become chart-toppers.
