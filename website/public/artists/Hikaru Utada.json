Adopting the stage name '''Cubic U''', they signed with [[Toshiba-EMI]] to release their English-language debut album, ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' (1998). Released the following year, their second album and Japanese-language debut, ''[[First Love (Hikaru Utada album)|First Love]]'' (1999), leaned further into R&B and dance-pop influences; it was a commercial success, becoming Japan's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] of all time. Its singles \"[[Automatic (Hikaru Utada song)|Automatic]]\", \"[[Time Will Tell (Hikaru Utada song)|Time Will Tell]]\", and \"[[Movin' On Without You]]\" were commercially successful, while the album sold two&nbsp;million units in its first week in Japan, topped the [[Oricon]] chart for six non-consecutive weeks, and sold six&nbsp;million more units throughout the rest of 1999.\n\nUtada's third album ''[[Distance (Hikaru Utada album)|Distance]]'' was released in early 2001 and spawned their biggest singles—\"[[Addicted to You (Hikaru Utada song)|Addicted to You]]\", \"[[Wait & See (Risk)]]\" and \"[[Can You Keep a Secret? (song)|Can You Keep a Secret?]]\" — each of which received multi-platinum certifications in Japan and other countries; it broke several sales records after three&nbsp;million copies were sold in its first week, instantly becoming Japan's [[Lists of fastest-selling albums#Japan|fastest-selling album]]. Her fourth album, ''[[Deep River (Hikaru Utada album)|Deep River]]'' (2002)—backed by chart-topping singles such as \"[[Traveling (song)|Traveling]]\", \"[[Hikari (Hikaru Utada song)|Hikari]]\" and \"[[Sakura Drops]]\"—incorporated elements of pop folk, and became one of Japan's top-selling records of all time. Their subsequent albums, ''[[Exodus (Hikaru Utada album)|Exodus]]'' (2004), ''[[Ultra Blue]]'' (2006) and ''[[Heart Station]]'' (2008), also sold millions of copies. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released the acoustic-driven albums ''[[Fantôme (album)|Fantôme]]'' (2016) and ''[[Hatsukoi (Hikaru Utada album)|Hatsukoi]]'' (2018), which reached number one on the Oricon albums chart. They topped the charts again with 2022's ''[[Bad Mode]]'', their first Japanese/English album.\n\nBy the end of the 2000s, Utada was deemed \"the most influential artist of the decade\" in the Japanese music landscape by ''[[The Japan Times]]''. They are one of Japan's [[List of best-selling music artists in Japan|top-selling recording artists]] of all time with over 40 million records sold. Twelve of their singles have reached number one on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]], while ten albums have become chart-toppers. Six of their full-length releases are among Japan's highest-selling albums, including ''First Love'', ''Distance'' and ''Deep River'', which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history. In 2021, Utada became one of the first Japanese figures to publicly identify as [[non-binary]].",
