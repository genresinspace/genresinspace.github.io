  "name": "Stahlgewitter",
  "description": "'''Stahlgewitter''' is a controversial German [[hard rock]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] group founded in 1995. Despite the genre's name, RAC song lyrics rarely focus on the specific topic of [[anti-communism]]. Rather, RAC lyrics typically feature [[nationalist]] themes. Stahlgewitter is listed by the group 'Netz gegen Nazis' (''Network Against Nazis'') as one of the more popular contemporary Rock Against Communism groups. This categorises Stahlgewitter in amongst other more historical Rock Against Communism groups such as the English band [[Skrewdriver]] which played a lending role in the formation of RAC and the fellow German band [[Landser (band)|Landser]] who are now deemed a \"criminal gang organisation\" in Germany.",
