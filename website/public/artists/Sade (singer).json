One of the most successful British female artists in history, she is often recognised as an influence on contemporary music. Her success in the music industry was recognised with the honour [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 2002, and she was made [[Order of the British Empire#Precedence and privileges|Commander]] in the [[2017 Birthday Honours]].\n\nSade was born in [[Ibadan]], [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], and was brought up in England from the age of four. She studied at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London and gained modest recognition as a fashion designer and part-time model before joining the band Pride in the early 1980s. After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1983. A year later, the band released the album ''[[Diamond Life]]'', which became one of the era's best-selling albums and the best-selling debut by a British female vocalist. \n\nIn July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the [[Live Aid]] charity concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] and in November the band released their second album, ''[[Promise (Sade album)|Promise]]''. The next year, she appeared in the film ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]''. The band released their third album (''[[Stronger Than Pride]]'') in 1988, and a fourth album (''[[Love Deluxe]]'') in 1992. The band went on hiatus in 1996 after the birth of Sade's child.\n\nThe band reunited in 1999 and the following year, released ''[[Lovers Rock (Sade album)|Lovers Rock]]'', their first album in eight years. ''Lovers Rock'' was a departure from the band's earlier jazz-inspired sounds. In 2010, the band released ''[[Soldier of Love (album)|Soldier of Love]]'', their sixth studio album, and toured arenas worldwide. Since that tour ended in 2011, the band has released two songs, \"[[Flower of the Universe]]\" for the soundtrack of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[A Wrinkle in Time (2018 film)|A Wrinkle in Time]]'', and \"[[The Big Unknown]]\", part of the soundtrack of [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]]'s film ''[[Widows (2018 film)|Widows]]''.",
