  "description": "'''Rise Against''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Chicago]], formed in 1999. The group's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[Tim McIlrath]], lead guitarist [[Zach Blair]], bassist [[Joe Principe]] and drummer [[Brandon Barnes]]. Rise Against's music emphasizes [[melody]], catchy [[Hook (music)|hooks]], an aggressive sound and playstyle, and rapid [[tempo]]s. Lyrically, the band is known for their [[social commentary]], covering a wide range of topics such as [[politics in the United States|politics]], [[animal rights]], [[humanitarianism]], and [[environmentalism]].\n\nThe band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label [[Fat Wreck Chords]], on which they released two studio albums, ''[[The Unraveling (Rise Against album)|The Unraveling]]'' (2001) and ''[[Revolutions per Minute (Rise Against album)|Revolutions per Minute]]'' (2003). Both the albums were met with underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the [[major label]] [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]], which was absorbed by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]. Rise Against's major label debut ''[[Siren Song of the Counter Culture]]'' (2004) brought the band mainstream success, largely in part to the popularity of the singles \"[[Give It All]]\" and \"[[Swing Life Away]]\". The band's next album, ''[[The Sufferer & the Witness]]'' (2006), peaked at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States, and was Rise Against's first album to chart in countries outside of North America.\n\nWith the release of ''[[Appeal to Reason (album)|Appeal to Reason]]'' (2008), Rise Against's music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The album's third single, \"[[Savior (Rise Against song)|Savior]]\", broke the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the [[Hot Rock Songs]] and [[Alternative Songs]] charts. Rise Against's popularity grew with the release of ''[[Endgame (Rise Against album)|Endgame]]'' (2011), which peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200, and charted highly worldwide. The band's seventh and eighth albums, ''[[The Black Market (Rise Against album)|The Black Market]]'' (2014) and ''[[Wolves (Rise Against album)|Wolves]]'' (2017), continued the trend of commercial success, and both peaked with the top ten on the ''Billboard'' 200, while their ninth album, ''[[Nowhere Generation]]'' (2021) failed to do the same. The band's tenth album, [[Ricochet (Rise Against album)|''Ricochet'']], released on August 15, 2025.\n\nRise Against is also known for their advocacy of [[progressivism]], supporting organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] and the [[It Gets Better Project]]. The band actively promotes [[animal rights]] and most of the members are [[straight edge]], [[PETA]] supporters and [[vegan]]s.",
