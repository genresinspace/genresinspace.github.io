  "description": "'''Randall William Rhoads''' (December 6, 1956 â€“ March 19, 1982) was an American guitarist. He was the co-founder and original guitarist of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Quiet Riot]], and the guitarist and co-songwriter for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s first two solo albums ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' (1980) and ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]'' (1981). Rhoads was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2021.\n\nOriginally educated in [[classical guitar]], Rhoads combined these early influences with heavy metal, helping form a sub-genre later known as [[neoclassical metal]]. With Quiet Riot, he adopted a black-and-white [[Polka dot|polka-dot]] theme which became an emblem for the group. He reached his peak as the guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne's solo career, performing on tracks including \"[[Crazy Train]]\" and \"[[Mr. Crowley]]\" on the ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' album. \"Crazy Train\" features one of the most well-known heavy metal guitar [[riff]]s.\n\nHe died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in [[Florida]] in 1982. Despite his short career, Rhoads is regarded as a pivotal figure in metal music, credited with pioneering a fast and technical style of guitar soloing that largely defined the metal scene of the 1980s. He helped popularize various guitar techniques now common in heavy metal music, including [[Tapping|two-handed tapping]], vibrato bar [[Dive bomb (guitar technique)|dive bomb]]s, and intricate scale patterns, drawing comparisons to his contemporary [[Eddie Van Halen]]. The [[Jackson Rhoads]] guitar was originally commissioned by him. He has been included in several published \"Greatest Guitarist\" lists, and has been cited by other prominent guitarists as a major influence.",
