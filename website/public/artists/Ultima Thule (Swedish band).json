  "name": "Ultima Thule",
  "description": "'''Ultima Thule''' ([[Latin]] for \"Farthest North\") is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] rock band. Their style is based on what they call ''[[Viking rock|Vikingarock]]'' (\"Viking rock\"), which combines occasional folk melodies with [[Rock music|rock]], mixed with [[Oi Punk|Oi!]], [[street punk]] and [[Teddy Boy]]. Some of their lyrics are versions of poems and traditional songs by [[Evert Taube]], such as \"Änglamark\". They have also released several versions of Sweden's national anthem, \"[[Du gamla, Du fria]]'\". They have been described as a [[white power]] band, though [[ethnomusicologist]] [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]] argues that this classification is much too simplistic. The band also rejects the description, saying they oppose fascism and racism.\n\n''För Fäderneslandet'' is Ultima Thule's most popular album, selling more than 100,000 copies. ''Vikingabalk'', their second best selling album, went gold with more than 80,000 copies sold.",
