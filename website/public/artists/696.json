  "description": "'''Coleman Randolph Hawkins''' (November 21, 1904 â€“ May 19, 1969), nicknamed \"Hawk\" and sometimes \"Bean\", was an American [[jazz]] tenor saxophonist. One of the first prominent jazz musicians on his instrument, as [[Joachim-Ernst Berendt|Joachim E. Berendt]] explained: \"There were some tenor players before him, but the instrument was not an acknowledged jazz horn\". Hawkins biographer [[John Chilton]] described the prevalent styles of tenor saxophone solos prior to Hawkins as \"mooing\" and \"rubbery belches\".  Hawkins denied being first and noted his contemporaries [[Happy Caldwell]], [[Stump Evans]], and [[Prince Robinson]], although he was the first to tailor his method of [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]] to the saxophone rather than imitate the techniques of the clarinet. Hawkins' virtuosic, [[arpeggiated]] approach to improvisation, with his characteristic rich, emotional, and vibrato-laden tonal style, was the main influence on a generation of tenor players that included [[Chu Berry]], [[Charlie Barnet]], [[Tex Beneke]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Vido Musso]], [[Herschel Evans]], [[Buddy Tate]], and [[Don Byas]], and through them the later tenormen, [[Arnett Cobb]], [[Illinois Jacquet]], [[Flip Phillips]], [[Ike Quebec]], [[Al Sears]], [[Paul Gonsalves]], and [[Lucky Thompson]].  While Hawkins became known with [[swing music]] during the [[big band]] era, he had a role in the development of [[bebop]] in the 1940s.\n\nFellow saxophonist [[Lester Young]], known as the \"President of the Tenor Saxophone\", commented, in a 1959 interview with ''[[The Jazz Review]]'': \"As far as I'm concerned, I think Coleman Hawkins was the president, first, right? As far as myself, I think I'm the second one.\" [[Miles Davis]] once said: \"When I heard Hawk, I learned to play ballads.\"",
