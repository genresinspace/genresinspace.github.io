  "description": "'''Jermaine Lamarr Cole''' (born January 28, 1985) is an American rapper and record producer. Born in a military base in Germany and raised in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], Cole initially gained attention as a rapper following the release of his debut mixtape, ''[[The Come Up]]'', in early 2007. Intent on further pursuing a musical career, he signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] in 2009 and released two additional mixtapes: ''[[The Warm Up]]'' (2009) and ''[[Friday Night Lights (mixtape)|Friday Night Lights]]'' (2010) to further critical acclaim as he garnered a wider following.\n\nEach of Cole's studio albums have peaked atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], beginning with his debut, ''[[Cole World: The Sideline Story]]'' (2011), and its follow-up, ''[[Born Sinner]]'' (2013). Both met with critical acclaim, the albums spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top 40 singles \"[[Work Out (J. Cole song)|Work Out]]\", \"[[Power Trip (song)|Power Trip]]\" (featuring [[Miguel (singer)|Miguel]]), and \"[[Crooked Smile]]\" (featuring [[TLC (band)|TLC]]). Despite commercial success, Cole departed from the [[pop rap|pop]]-oriented sound of the albums in favor of [[Conscious hip hop|conscious]] subject matter for his subsequent projects; themes of [[nostalgia]], [[racial inequality in the United States|racial inequality]], and [[idealism|materialism]] were explored respectively in his following releases: ''[[2014 Forest Hills Drive]]'' (2014), ''[[4 Your Eyez Only]]'' (2016) and ''[[KOD (album)|KOD]]'' (2018). ''4 Your Eyez Only'' yielded his furthest commercial success—selling an estimated 500,000 [[Album-equivalent unit|album-equivalent units]] in its first week, while the latter featured a then-record six simultaneous top 20 hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100—the first time a musical act achieved this feat since English rock band [[the Beatles]] in 1964. His sixth album, ''[[The Off-Season]]'' (2021), was met with continued success and spawned the single \"[[My Life (J. Cole, 21 Savage and Morray song)|My Life]]\" (with [[21 Savage]] and [[Morray]]), which peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Its chart success was matched by his guest appearance on the 2023 single \"[[All My Life (Lil Durk song)|All My Life]]\" by [[Lil Durk]], and succeeded by his first song to peak the chart, \"[[First Person Shooter (song)|First Person Shooter]]\" by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] that same year. The former also won Cole a [[Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance]].\n\nSelf-taught on piano, Cole also acts as a [[Hip hop production|producer]] alongside his recording career—having largely handled the production of his own projects—with credits on material for other artists, including [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Young Thug]], [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], and [[Mac Miller]], among others. Cole's side ventures include his record label [[Dreamville Records]], as well as its [[Dreamville Ventures|namesake media company]] and [[Dreamville Records#The Dreamville Foundation|non-profit]]. The label, having signed artists including [[JID]], [[Ari Lennox]], [[Bas (rapper)|Bas]], and [[EarthGang]], has released four compilation albums; their third, ''[[Revenge of the Dreamers III]]'' (2019), debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200 and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]. In January 2015, Cole began housing single mothers rent-free at his childhood home in Fayetteville.\n\nCole has won two [[Grammy Award]]s from seventeen nominations, a [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]] for [[Billboard Music Award for Top Rap Album|Top Rap Album]], three [[Soul Train Music Awards]], and eight [[BET Hip Hop Awards]]. Each of his albums—including ''Revenge of the Dreamers III''—have received [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|platinum]] certifications by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).",
