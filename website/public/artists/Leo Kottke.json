  "description": "'''Leo Kottke''' (born September 11, 1945) is an American [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitarist]]. He is known for a [[fingerpicking]] style that draws on [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[folk music]], and for [[syncopation|syncopated]], [[polyphony|polyphonic]] melodies. He has overcome a series of personal obstacles, including [[partial loss of hearing]] and a nearly career-ending bout with [[tendon]] damage in his right hand, to emerge as a widely recognized master of his instrument. He resides in the [[Minneapolis]] area with his family.\n\nFocusing primarily on instrumental composition and playing, Kottke also sings sporadically, in an unconventional yet expressive [[baritone]] described by himself as sounding like \"geese farts on a muggy day\". In concert, Kottke intersperses humorous and often bizarre [[monologues]] with vocal and instrumental selections from throughout his career, played solo on [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|six-]] and [[twelve string guitar|12-string]] guitars.",
