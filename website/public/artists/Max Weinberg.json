  "name": "Max Weinberg",
  "description": "'''Max Weinberg''' (born April 13, 1951) is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[E Street Band]] and as the bandleader for [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''. He is the father of former [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and current [[Suicidal Tendencies]] drummer [[Jay Weinberg]].\n\nWeinberg grew up in suburban [[New Jersey]] and began drumming at an early age. He attended college planning to be a lawyer but got his big break in music in 1974 when he won an audition to become the drummer for Springsteen. Weinberg became a mainstay of Springsteen's long concert performances. Springsteen dissolved the band in 1989, and Weinberg spent several years considering a law career and trying the business end of the music industry before deciding he wanted to continue with drumming.\n\nIn 1993, Weinberg got the role as bandleader of [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band#The Max Weinberg 7|the Max Weinberg 7]] for ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien''. Weinberg's drums-driven [[jump blues]] sound and his role as a comic foil prospered along with the show, giving him a second career. In 1999, Springsteen re-formed the E Street Band for a series of tours and albums; Weinberg worked out an arrangement that allowed him to play with both O'Brien and Springsteen. In 2009, Weinberg moved to the short-lived ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' as leader of [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band#Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band|Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band]]. Upon that program's conclusion, Weinberg declined to follow O'Brien to the new ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' show. Weinberg has continued playing with Springsteen, and in 2014 was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the E Street Band.",
