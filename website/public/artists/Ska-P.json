  "description": "'''Ska-P''' ({{IPA|es|esˈkape}}) is a Spanish [[ska punk]] band formed in 1994 in [[Vallecas]], a district of [[Madrid]], by a group of friends from Madrid, Navarre and Euskadi. \n\nThe band can be categorized, politically, as an [[anti-establishment]] musical group, sometimes even considered [[anarcho-communist]]. Musically, despite their fun image, Ska-P has well-rehearsed and tight arrangements, and as of 2002, includes among its members a [[brass section]].\n\nAt the end of 2004, they announced work on a new album. After voting four against two, in February 2005, the sudden and unexpected announcement was made that the band would take a break to allow the members to work on side projects, though some considered the band to have dissolved. Their farewell concert in September 2005 filled the 10,000-seat [[La Cubierta]] in Spain. The band's worldwide farewell tour of 2005 ended in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, in October of that year.\n\nIn October 2007 the band confirmed they were getting back together and in September 2008 released the single \"Crimen sollicitationis\". This was followed in October by a new album, ''[[Lágrimas y gozos]]'' (\"tears and joy\"). The release of the album was followed by a brief tour. Ska-P returned to La Cubierta Stadium in December 2008 to perform their only concert in Spain of that tour. In 2010 and 2011, Ska-P held their first tour in Japan.",
