  "description": "'''Donald Christopher Barber''' {{post-nominals|OBE}} (17 April 1930 â€“ 2 March 2021) was an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and [[Trombone|trombonist]]. He helped many musicians with their careers and had a UK top twenty [[trad jazz]] hit with \"[[Petite Fleur]]\" in 1959. These musicians included the [[blues]] singer [[Ottilie Patterson]], who was at one time his wife, and [[Lonnie Donegan]], whose appearances with Barber triggered the [[skiffle]] craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \"[[Rock Island Line]]\", while with Barber's band. He provided an audience for Donegan and, later, [[Alexis Korner]], and sponsored African-American blues musicians to visit Britain, making Barber a significant figure in launching the British [[rhythm and blues]] and \"[[beat boom]]\" of the 1960s.",
