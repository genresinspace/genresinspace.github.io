  "description": "'''Rorschach''' is an American [[hardcore punk]] band from [[New Jersey]] that existed from 1989 to 1993 and again from 2009 to 2012. Their typical blend of hardcore with [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonant]] [[Heavy metal music|metal]] elements provided an inspiration to many later metalcore and [[post-hardcore]] bands.\n\nThe first release by the band, ''Remain Sedate'', shows the band's sound at a stage when they played fast, heavy hardcore with a metal slant and raspy hardcore vocals. At this time they also drew heavy comparisons to [[Die Kreuzen]] for their bizarre [[chord progression]]s and Charles Maggio's unearthly howl. However, as the band progressed, they developed a slower, more sinister, [[Sludge metal|sludge]] sound that was influenced by New York band [[Swans (band)|Swans]]. Additionally, the vocals developed into high-pitched, tortured screaming rather than shouting, due in part to voice problems Maggio was experiencing at the time. This change in sound can be heard primarily on their second full-length release, ''[[Protestant (album)|Protestant]]''. Shortly after issuing this album, the group disbanded, some members eventually joining [[Deadguy]] and [[Kiss It Goodbye]].\n\nRorschach has performed occasional reunion shows from 2009 through 2012.\n\n[[Decibel (magazine)|''Decibel'']] magazine inducted ''Protestant'' into their Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the 2012 film ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]],'' the Rorschach song \"Pavlov's Dogs\" is used to torture suspected terrorists.",
