Their repertoire includes [[gospel music|gospel]],  [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[doo-wop]], and [[soul music|soul]].\n\nThe group was founded as '''the Roosters''' by [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] natives [[Sam Gooden]], Richard Brooks and Arthur Brooks, who moved to [[Chicago]] and added [[Jerry Butler]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] to their line-up to become '''Jerry Butler & the Impressions'''. By 1962, Butler and the Brookses had departed, and after switching to [[ABC-Paramount Records]], Mayfield, Gooden, and returning original Impressions' member [[Fred Cash]] collectively became a top-selling soul act. Mayfield left the group for a solo career in 1970; [[Leroy Hutson]], Ralph Johnson, Reggie Torian (born Reginald Torian), and Nate Evans ([[Twinight Records]]) were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash.\n\nInductees into both the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]], the Impressions had a string of hits in the 1960s, many of which were heavily influenced by [[gospel music]] and served as inspirational anthems for the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. They are also 1998 [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] inductees for their hit \"[[People Get Ready]]\", and winners of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation|Rhythm and Blues Foundation's]] Pioneer Award (in 2000). The group's long career spanned over 60 years at the time of their retirement in 2018.",
