  "description": "'''Friends''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] ''[[dansband]]'' or [[pop music|pop]] group formed in 1999 and made up of [[Stefan Brunzell]], [[Tony Haglund]], [[Kristian Hermanson]], [[Nina Inhammar]], [[Kim Kärnfalk]] and [[Peter Strandberg]]. They were put together from auditions on the [[reality television]] show '''''Friends på turne''''' (''Friends on Tour''), made by [[Bert Karlsson]] for [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]. The show was a success and Friends competed on [[Melodifestivalen 2000]], reaching second place. They won [[Melodifestivalen 2001]] with \"Lyssna till ditt hjärta\" and represented Sweden at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]] with the English version of the song, \"[[Listen to Your Heartbeat]].” Following their Eurovision participation, the Swedish delegation was forced to pay royalties to the team behind \"[[Liefde is een kaartspel]]\", the 1996 [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgian entry]], making the song the first admitted case of plagiarism in Eurovision history.\n\nThe band split in 2002, with Inhammar and Kärnfalk forming their own duo ''[[Nina & Kim]]''. In 2004, they attempted to represent Sweden with their song “En Gång För Alla” but came 7th in the second pre-selection round.  After 2006, Kärnfalk continued as a solo artist.",
