The band achieved mainstream success in 1985 with the album ''[[Night Time (album)|Night Time]]'' and particularly the single \"[[Love Like Blood (song)|Love Like Blood]]\" which reached the top ten in Belgium, the Netherlands and New Zealand.\n\nThe band's musical style emerged from the [[post-punk]] scene, but stood out due to their heavier approach, and has been cited as a key influence on [[industrial rock]]. Their style evolved over many years, at times incorporating elements of [[gothic rock]], [[synth-pop]] and [[electronic music]], but always featuring Walker's prominent guitar and Coleman's \"savagely strident vocals\". Killing Joke have influenced many later bands and artists, such as [[Metallica]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Soundgarden]].\n\nFollowing Raven's sudden death in 2007, all four founding members returned to the band's lineup the following year. Coleman and Walker were the only constant members of the band until Walker's death in 2023.",
