  "description": "'''Bad Boy Chiller Crew''' (abbreviated as '''BBCC''') are a [[Yorkshire]] [[UK rap|rap]] collective from [[Bradford]], UK. The group is composed of Gareth \"GK\" Kelly, Kane Welsh, and Sam \"Clive\" Robinson. \n\nThe group began by uploading comedy and [[prank]] videos on a Facebook page named \"itzmefraz\" as far back as 2017. The page was created by Kane and Kieran \"Fraz\" Durkin. In late 2018, they began to make music as Bad Boy Chiller Crew with early members Fraz, Lewis \"Molegrip\" Lock and Clive. Kane then became an [[Emcees|MC]] with the group after being in the background, mostly recording videos prior. GK later joined as their DJ (eventually to also become an MC) and after internal feuds, Fraz and Molegrip were kicked out of the group in the first half of 2019. \n\nIn December 2019, ''[[The Guardian]]'' named them as one of their \"50 new artists for 2020\".\n\nIn November 2021, the band appeared in their own six-episode, self-titled reality TV series, broadcast on ITV2.\n\nIn early 2020, the group were signed by the London-based record label House Anxiety.\n\n''[[Disrespectful (mixtape)|Disrespectful]]'' was ranked 10th in ''[[The New York Times]]''' \"Best Albums of 2022\" by [[Jon Caramanica]].",
