Following his departure, the trio were frequently joined by multi-instrumentalist Seth Evans and saxophonist Kaidi Akinnibi, both as session musicians and during live performances. Their name is derived from the Japanese [[electronic music]] genre [[black MIDI]], though their own music has no relation to it, instead incorporating styles such as [[math rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[post-punk]], and [[avant-jazz]].\n\nPart of the [[Windmill scene]], the band began on producer [[Dan Carey (record producer)|Dan Carey]]'s record label Speedy Wunderground, through which they released their debut single, \"bmbmbm\", in 2018.

It received critical acclaim, entered the top 50 of the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was nominated for the 2019 [[Mercury Prize]]. An anthology album including several recorded jams and spoken-word tracks, ''[[The Black Midi Anthology Vol. 1: Tales of Suspense and Revenge]]'', was released on 5 June 2020 exclusively to [[Bandcamp]]. In January 2021, founding member Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin went on hiatus from the group for health reasons. The band's second studio album, ''[[Cavalcade (Black Midi album)|Cavalcade]]'', was released on 26 May 2021. Their third studio album, ''[[Hellfire (Black Midi album)|Hellfire]]'', was released on 15 July 2022. \n\nThe band entered an indefinite hiatus in August 2024, as each member focused on other work; Greep released his highly acclaimed solo album ''[[The New Sound]]'', Picton formed a new group, My New Band Believe, and Simpson began working with jazz musician [[Nala Sinephro]] and rapper [[Little Simz]].",
