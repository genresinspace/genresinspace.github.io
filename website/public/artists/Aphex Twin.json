[[free party|free parties]] and clubs around the [[South West England|South West]] in the late 1980s. His debut EP ''[[Analogue Bubblebath]],'' released in 1991 on [[Mighty Force Records]], brought James an early following; he began to perform across the UK and [[continental Europe]]. James co-founded the independent label [[Rephlex Records]] the same year. His 1992 debut album ''[[Selected Ambient Works 85–92]]'', released by Belgian label [[Apollo Records (Belgium)|Apollo]], garnered wider critical and popular acclaim. James signed to [[Warp Records|Warp]] in late 1992 and subsequently released charting albums such as ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' (1995) and ''[[Richard D. James Album]]'' (1996), as well as [[Top 40]] singles such as \"[[Come to Daddy (song)|Come to Daddy]]\" (1997) and \"[[Windowlicker]]\" (1999); the latter two were accompanied by [[music video]]s directed by [[Chris Cunningham]] and brought James wider international attention.\n\nAfter releasing ''[[Drukqs]]'' in 2001 and completing his contract with Warp, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 ''[[Analord]]'' EP series under his AFX alias and a pair of 2007 releases as the Tuss. In 2014 he made available a [[Caustic Window LP|previously unreleased 1994 LP]] as Caustic Window. He returned later that year with the Aphex Twin album ''[[Syro]]'' on Warp, winning the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album]]. He has since released charting EPs including ''[[Cheetah (EP)|Cheetah]]'' (2016) and ''[[Collapse EP|Collapse]]'' (2018). His 2023 single \"[[Blackbox Life Recorder 21f]]\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording]].",
