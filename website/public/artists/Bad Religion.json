  "description": "'''Bad Religion''' is an American [[punk rock]] band, formed in [[Los Angeles]], California, in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple lineup changes, with singer [[Greg Graffin]] being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members [[Jay Bentley]] and [[Brett Gurewitz]] have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist [[Mike Dimkich]] and drummer [[Jamie Miller (US musician)|Jamie Miller]] have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.\n\nAfter gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major-label [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1993. The band pioneered the [[Punk rock#Pop-punk and mainstream success|punk rock revival]] movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for [[Punk rock in California|California-based punk bands]] such as [[Green Day]] and Epitaph-signed acts [[the Offspring]], [[NOFX]] and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]. They are also cited as an inspiration or influence on the 1990s and 2000s [[pop punk]], [[skate punk]], [[post-hardcore]], [[screamo]] and [[emo]] scenes.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/7-reasons-why-bad-religions-brett-gurewitz-is-the-godfather-of-punk-rock | title=7 reasons why Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz is the godfather of Californian punk | date=December 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/archives/recordings-view-punk-relives-its-heyday.html | title=RECORDINGS VIEW; Punk Relives Its Heyday | work=The New York Times | date=October 2, 1994 | last1=Diehl | first1=Matt }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2022/03/the-100-greatest-pop-punk-songs-of-all-time.html | title=The 100 greatest pop punk songs of all time | date=March 2, 2022 | access-date=December 11, 2023 | archive-date=March 3, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220303183529/https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2022/03/the-100-greatest-pop-punk-songs-of-all-time.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://thewarwhoop.com/10082/ae/punks-not-dead-punk-then-and-now/ | title=Punk's Not Dead: Punk then and Now }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-albums-on-epitaph-records | title=The 10 best albums on Epitaph Records | date=June 26, 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/arts/punk-s-earnest-new-mission.html | title=Punk's Earnest New Mission | work=The New York Times | date=January 4, 2004 | last1=Azerrad | first1=Michael }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.noecho.net/features/pop-punk-hardcore-connection | title=The Pop-Punk and Hardcore Connection &#124; Features | date=December 20, 2018 | access-date=December 11, 2023 | archive-date=December 8, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231208000908/https://noecho.net/features/pop-punk-hardcore-connection | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Punk vs Screamo| website=The Content Authority | date=29 June 2023 | url=https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/punk-vs-screamo | access-date=17 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Banda deny lidera festival de metalcore en auditorio sur de temperle |url=http://ar.omg.yahoo.com/noticias/banda-deny-lidera-festival-metalcore-auditorio-sur-temperle-113403647.html |website=Yahoo! |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105110510/http://ar.omg.yahoo.com/noticias/banda-deny-lidera-festival-metalcore-auditorio-sur-temperle-113403647.html |archive-date=5 January 2013 |language=es |date=23 February 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nAtlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger than Fiction]]''. ''Stranger than Fiction'' included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including \"[[Infected (song)|Infected]]\", \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger than Fiction]]\", and the re-recorded version of \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\" (the latter of which its original version appeared four years earlier on ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]''); the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Shortly before the release of ''Stranger than Fiction'', Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]]. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with \"[[Sorrow (Bad Religion song)|Sorrow]]\", \"[[Los Angeles Is Burning]]\", and \"[[The Devil in Stitches]]\" becoming Top 40 hits on the [[Alternative Airplay|US charts]] while their sixteenth studio album, ''[[True North (Bad Religion album)|True North]]'' (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth studio album, ''[[Age of Unreason (album)|Age of Unreason]]'', was released on May 3, 2019.",
