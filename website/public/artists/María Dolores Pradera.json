  "description": "'''María Dolores Fernández Pradera''' {{post-nominal styles|post-noms=[[Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise|OAXS]] [[Medal of Merit in Labour|MMT]]}} (29 August 1924 – 28 May 2018) was a Spanish melodic singer and actress, and one of the most famous voices in Spain and [[Latin America]].\n\nShe started her career as an actress and during the 1950s she started singing professionally, eventually abandoning her career as an actress in the 1960s. She released more than 35 records.\n\nAs a singer, she specialized in traditional Spanish and Latin American music: [[bolero]], [[Copla (music)|copla]], [[ballad]], [[ronda]], [[Vals criollo|vals]], and [[folk music]] ([[Peruvian music|Peruvian]], [[Argentine music|Argentine]], [[Mexican music|Mexican]], and [[Venezuelan music|Venezuelan]]). Her [[contralto]] voice had a deep resonance and sure melodic footing which must stem from classical training. Her pronunciation was pure [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], and her music pure Latin American. She typically sang accompanied by [[guitar]]s, [[requinto]]s, and drums. She sang for close to 30 years with the same group, Los Gemelos, formed by twin brothers, Santiago and Julián López Hernández, until the death of Santiago in the early 1990s.",
