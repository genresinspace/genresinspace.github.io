  "name": "Van Dyke Parks",
  "description": "'''Van Dyke Parks''' (born January 3, 1943) is an American musician, songwriter, arranger, record producer, singer, and former [[Warner Bros. Records]] executive whose work encompasses [[orchestral pop]], elaborate [[recording studio as an instrument|recording experiments]], [[Americana (culture)|Americana]] iconography, free-associative lyrics, and [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] sounds. He is best known for his 1967 album ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' and his collaborative work with acts such as [[the Beach Boys]], [[Lowell George]], and [[Harry Nilsson]], as well as various film and television scores.\n\nBorn in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], Parks studied voice and piano at the [[American Boychoir School]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], touring nationally with the choir during his youth. He concurrently pursued child acting roles in television and theater productions. After relocating to California in 1963, he performed [[folk music]] with his brother [[Carson Parks|Carson]] along the West Coast and contributed arrangements to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film soundtracks, including \"[[The Bare Necessities]]\" for ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967). Following two singles issued on [[MGM Records]]—\"[[Come to the Sunshine]]\" (1966) and a [[folk rock]] adaptation of [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]]—he became an active session musician in [[Laurel Canyon]], working with artists such as [[Tim Buckley]], [[Judy Collins]], and [[the Byrds]] before collaborating with [[Brian Wilson]] on the Beach Boys' ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', later completed in 2004 as [[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|Wilson's solo album]].\n\nIn 1966, Parks joined Warner Bros. through producer [[Lenny Waronker]], with whom he collaborated on numerous albums—including those by [[Harpers Bizarre]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Arlo Guthrie]], and [[Ry Cooder]]—and formed part of a creative circle at the label. One of the most expensive LPs ever produced at the time, ''Song Cycle'' achieved critical acclaim and influenced the 1970s [[singer-songwriter]] movement despite poor sales. He transitioned to an executive role at Warner Bros., where he facilitated label signings—including the Beach Boys, [[Little Feat]], [[Peter Ivers]], and [[Beaver & Krause]]—and spearheaded the first ever label division centered on promotional films for artists; his concepts later became foundational to [[MTV]].\n\nInfluenced by the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], Parks deepened his engagement with Caribbean musical traditions, promoting Trinidadian [[calypso (music)|calypso]] and [[steel pan]] music through projects such as his album ''[[Discover America]]'' (1971), productions for [[Mighty Sparrow]] and the [[Esso Trinidad Steel Band]], and Nilsson's mid-1970s recordings. After the late 1970s, Parks focused on composing for film and television, contributing to works including ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (with Nilsson, 1980), ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird|Follow That Bird]]'' (1985), and ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' (1987). He authored a trilogy of children's books based on his 1984 album ''[[Jump! (album)|Jump!]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Br'er Rabbit]] folktales. He has remained active as a collaborator and arranger, working with artists such as [[Haruomi Hosono]], [[Rufus Wainwright]], [[Silverchair]], and [[Joanna Newsom]], while releasing three additional studio albums: ''[[Tokyo Rose (album)|Tokyo Rose]]'' (1989), ''[[Orange Crate Art]]'' (with Wilson, 1995), and ''[[Songs Cycled]]'' (2013).",
