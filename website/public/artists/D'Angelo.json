He first garnered attention after co-producing the single \"[[U Will Know]]\" for R&B [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Black Men United]]. His debut studio album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995), was certified [[Platinum certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and received widespread acclaim from music critics, who have credited the album for ushering in the [[neo soul]] movement. His third single, \"[[Lady (D'Angelo song)|Lady]]\", reached the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nD'Angelo then collaborated with artists such as [[Erykah Badu]], [[Lauryn Hill]], and then-girlfriend [[Angie Stone]]. His next album, ''[[Voodoo (D'Angelo album)|Voodoo]]'' (2000), debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and continued to receive critical acclaim. The album's lead single \"[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]\" earned him the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] while the album itself won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]]. Following this period, D'Angelo became increasingly uncomfortable with his growing status as a [[sex symbol]]. This was followed by numerous personal struggles, including alcoholism, which resulted in limited musical output for several years.\n\nAfter over a decade spent mostly out of the public eye, he then released his third studio album, ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]'', in 2014. The album was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The same year, D'Angelo was hailed as the next [[Marvin Gaye]] by ''[[GQ]]''.",
