She was recognized as Woman of the Year and with a Rulebreaker Award at [[Billboard Women in Music|''Billboard'' Women in Music]], with the [[Billboard Spirit of Hope Award|Spirit of Hope Award]] at the [[2023 Billboard Latin Music Awards|''Billboard'' Latin Music Awards]], and has eleven ''[[Guinness World Records]]''.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Medellín]], Giraldo launched her career as a teenager, appearing on the Colombian spinoff of ''[[The X Factor]]''. She moved to New York in 2014 to learn more about the music industry and signed with [[Universal Music Latino]]. In late 2018, her duet \"[[Secreto (song)|Secreto]]\" became a hit in Latin America, as she and Puerto Rican artist [[Anuel AA]] publicly confirmed their relationship via the music video.\n\nIn July 2019, she released \"[[China (Anuel AA song)|China]]\" in collaboration with Anuel AA, [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Ozuna]], and [[J Balvin]], which became her first music video with over one billion views on [[YouTube]]. In May 2019, she released the album ''[[Ocean (Karol G album)|Ocean]]'', which served as a stylistic departure from ''Unstoppable'', incorporating a more relaxed and less \"pop\" sound while incorporating reggaetón influences. Popular singles from the album include the title track (later released as a remix with [[Jessie Reyez]]). Later that year, her song \"[[Tusa (song)|Tusa]]\" charted internationally and was certified 28× Latin platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

Throughout the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], and into early 2021, she would release successful songs, including some of her most famous (\"[[Ay, Dios Mío!]]\", \"[[Bichota]]\" and \"[[Location (Karol G song)|Location]]\"), in the lead-up to her third album, ''[[KG0516]]'', which was released in spring of that year, topping the U.S. Latin albums chart.\n\nGiraldo released her fourth album, ''[[Mañana Será Bonito]]'', in the spring of 2023; the record was immediately recognized as the first-ever Spanish-language album by a female artist to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. She achieved her highest-charting single on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with the song \"[[TQG]]\", a collaboration with fellow Colombian singer-songwriter [[Shakira]], reaching the No. 7 position.
