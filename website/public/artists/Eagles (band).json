With five number-one singles, six number-one albums, six [[Grammy Award]]s and five [[American Music Award]]s, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s in North America. In addition, they are one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]], having sold more than 200{{nbsp}}million records worldwide, including 100{{nbsp}}million sold in the US alone. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998 and were ranked number 75 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 2010 list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\". \n\nFounding members [[Glenn Frey]] (guitar, vocals), [[Don Henley]] (drums, vocals), [[Bernie Leadon]] (guitar, vocals), and [[Randy Meisner]] (bass guitar, vocals) had all been recruited by [[Linda Ronstadt]] as band members, some touring with her, and all playing on her [[Linda Ronstadt (album)|self-titled third solo studio album]] (1972), before venturing out on their own as the Eagles on [[David Geffen]]'s new [[Asylum Records]] label. Their debut studio album, ''[[Eagles (album)|Eagles]]'' (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: \"[[Take It Easy]]\" and \"[[Witchy Woman]]\". The next year's follow-up album, ''[[Desperado (Eagles album)|Desperado]]'', peaked at only number 41 in the US, although [[Desperado (Eagles song)|the title song]] became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist [[Don Felder]] joined, and ''[[On the Border]]'' produced the top-40 hit \"[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]\" and the Eagles' first number-one song in the US and Canada, \"[[Best of My Love (Eagles song)|Best of My Love]]\", which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'' became their first number-one album in the US and a top ten album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit \"[[One of These Nights (Eagles song)|One of These Nights]]\", which was their first top ten hit outside of North America, and the US top-5 song \"[[Lyin' Eyes]]\" and \"[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]\". Also in 1975, Leadon left the band and was replaced by guitarist and vocalist [[Joe Walsh]].\n\n''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)]]'' (1976) is the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling album in the United States]], with 40 million copies sold. This album primed the public for the late 1976 release of ''[[Hotel California (album)|Hotel California]]'', which would sell more than 28{{nbsp}}million copies in the US (ranking third all-time for US sales), and more than 32{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, \"[[New Kid in Town]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom while also reaching the top ten in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.\n\nMeisner was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'', spawning the North American number-one song \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits \"[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]\" and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'', a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]]. In 2013, they began the extended [[History of the Eagles – Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]] in conjunction with the documentary release, ''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Following Frey's death in January 2016, the Eagles re-formed in 2017, with Glenn's son, Deacon Frey, and country singer [[Vince Gill]] sharing lead vocals for Frey's songs. Deacon left the band in 2022, but returned in 2023 to participate in the band's ongoing final tour. Meisner died in 2023.",
