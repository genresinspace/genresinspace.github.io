  "name": "Blind Willie Johnson",
  "description": "'''Willie Johnson''' (January 25, 1897 â€“ September 18, 1945), commonly known as '''Blind Willie Johnson''', was an American [[gospel blues]] singer and guitarist. His landmark recordings completed between 1927 and 1930, thirty songs in all, display a combination of powerful [[chest voice]] singing, [[slide guitar]] skills and originality that has influenced generations of musicians. His records sold well though as a street performer and preacher, he had little wealth in his lifetime. His life was poorly documented, but over time, music historians such as [[Samuel Charters]] have uncovered more about him and his five recording sessions.\n\nA revival of interest in Johnson's music began in the 1960s following his inclusion on [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith]]'s ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' and by the efforts of the blues guitarist [[Reverend Gary Davis]]. Along with Davis, he has since been considered the dominant player of [[holy blues]] music which convey religious themes in a blues style, often with a blues style of guitar accompaniment.\n\nJohnson's work has become more accessible through [[compilation album]]s such as ''[[American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson]]'' and the Charters compilations. As a result, Johnson is credited as one of the most influential practitioners of the blues and his slide guitar playing, particularly on his hymn \"[[Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground]]\", is highly acclaimed. Other recordings by Johnson include \"[[Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed]]\", \"[[It's Nobody's Fault but Mine]]\" and \"[[John the Revelator (Blind Willie Johnson song)|John the Revelator]]\".",
