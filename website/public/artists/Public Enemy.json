Their debut album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', was released in 1987 to critical acclaim, and their second album, ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' (1988), was the first hip hop album to top ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll. Their next three albums, ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'' (1990), ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' (1991), and ''[[Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age]]'' (1994), were also well received. The group has since released eleven more studio albums, including [[He Got Game (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] to the 1998 sports-drama film ''[[He Got Game]]'' and a collaborative album with [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]], ''[[Rebirth of a Nation]]'' (2006). Their most recent album, ''Black Sky Over the Projects: Apartment 2025'', was released in 2025.\n\nPublic Enemy has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with Chuck D and Flavor Flav remaining the only constant members. Co-founder [[Professor Griff]] left in 1989 but rejoined in 1998, before parting ways again some years later{{when|date=May 2025}}. [[DJ Lord]] also joined Public Enemy in 1998 as the replacement of the group's original DJ [[Terminator X]]. In 2020, it was announced that Flavor Flav had been fired from the group.

They were honored with the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|62nd Grammy Awards]].",
