  "description": "'''Solomon Vincent McDonald Burke''' (born '''James Solomon McDonald''', March 21, 1940&nbsp;– October 10, 2010) was an American singer who shaped the sound of [[rhythm and blues]] as one of the founding fathers of [[soul music]] in the [[1960s in music|1960s]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2006|p=29}} He has been called \"a key transitional figure bridging R&B and soul\", and was known for his \"prodigious output\".{{sfn|Stambler|1974|p=83}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|1981|p=116}}\n\nHe had a string of hits including \"[[Cry to Me]]\", \"[[If You Need Me]]\", \"[[Got to Get You Off My Mind]]\", \"[[Down in the Valley (Solomon Burke song)|Down in the Valley]]\", and \"[[Everybody Needs Somebody to Love]]\". Burke was referred to [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|honorifically]] as \"King Solomon\", the \"King of [[Rock'n'Roll|Rock]] 'n' Soul\", \"Bishop of Soul\", and the \"[[Muhammad Ali]] of Soul\". Due to his minimal chart success in comparison to other soul music greats such as [[James Brown]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and [[Otis Redding]], Burke has been described as the genre's \"most unfairly overlooked singer\" of its golden age. [[Atlantic Records]] executive [[Jerry Wexler]] referred to Burke as \"the greatest male soul singer of all time\".{{sfn|Wexler|1993|p=49}}\n\nBurke's most famous recordings, which spanned five years in the early 1960s, bridged the gap between mainstream R&B and grittier R&B. Burke was \"a singer whose smooth, powerful articulation and mingling of sacred and profane themes helped define soul music in the early 1960s.\" He drew from his roots—[[gospel (music)|gospel]], [[jazz music|jazz]], [[country music|country]], and [[blues]]—as well as developing his own style at a time when R&B, and [[rock music|rock]] were both still in their infancy. Described as both \"[[François Rabelais|Rabelaisian]]\" and also as a \"spiritual enigma\", \"perhaps more than any other artist, the ample figure of Solomon Burke symbolized the ways that [[spirituality]] and commerce, ecstasy and entertainment, sex and salvation, individualism and brotherhood, could blend in the world of 1960s soul music.\"\n\nDuring the 55 years that he performed professionally, Burke released 38 [[studio album]]s on at least 17 [[record label]]s and had 35 singles that [[Record chart|charted]] on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts, including 31 singles that made the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]]s and 26 that made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2001, Burke was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a performer. His album ''[[Don't Give Up on Me (album)|Don't Give Up on Me]]'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2003. By 2005 Burke was credited with selling 17 million albums. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Burke as No. 89 on its 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\".",
