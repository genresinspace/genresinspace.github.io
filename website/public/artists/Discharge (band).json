  "description": "'''Discharge''' are an English [[hardcore punk]] band formed in 1977 in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], Staffordshire. The band is known for influencing several sub-genres of extreme music and their songs have been covered by some of the biggest names in heavy metal and other genres. The musical sub-genre of [[D-beat]] is named after Discharge and the band's distinctive drumbeat.\n\nThe band is characterized by a minimalistic approach to music and lyrics, using a heavy, distorted and grinding guitar-driven sound and raw, shouted vocals similar to a political speech, with lyrics on [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] themes, over intense drone-like rhythms. The band's sound has been called a \"grave-black aural acid assault.\" Discharge \"paved the way for an astounding array of politically motivated, musically intense and deeply confrontational bands\". Discharge was \"explicitly political\" and displayed a \"revolutionary/activist\" attitude that moved [[Hardcore punk in the United Kingdom|British hardcore punk]] away from its [[pub rock (UK)|pub rock]] origins and towards a \"dangerous and provocative\" or [[anti-establishment]] [[leftist]] territory.\n\nDischarge paved the way for various [[extreme metal]] styles such as [[thrash metal]], [[black metal]], [[crust punk]] and [[grindcore]]. The band's \"brutal, extremist approach\" and \"extreme thrash noise\" style of playing eventually led to the thrash genre.  \"Discharge's influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], [[Sepultura]], [[Soulfly]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]] and [[Arch Enemy (band)|Arch Enemy]] have covered Discharge's songs in tribute.\" Discharge was a major influence on at least two generations of metal.",
