  "description": "'''Mamaleek''' is an American [[Avant-garde metal|experimental metal]] group from [[San Francisco]], founded in 2008 by two anonymous brothers.  The name supposedly derives from [[Arabic]], and is the plural of [[mamluk]], or \"slave\".\n\nIn 2011, the band was signed with Enemies List; that year, their album ''Kurdaitcha'' topped Leor Galil's \"Best Free Albums of 2011\" list. The band has released nine albums, and are signed with the San Francisco-based alternative label [[The Flenser]].\n\nRegarding the band's style and genre, [[Vice (magazine)#Website|''Noisey'']] wrote: \"It's [[black metal]], but then again, it isn't; there are massive [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[jazz]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] influences, as well as pronounced Middle Eastern inclinations in melody and aesthetic\". According to ''Stereoboard'', they \"are a band like no other....Portishead playing lo-fi metal might be somewhere vaguely near the mark\". Galil said they \"mix Middle Eastern song structures and samples, atonal experimental and avant-garde accents, guttural metal howls, accessible electronic breakbeats, sludgy doom metal guitar-work, nimble piano interludes, and plenty of pop panache to create an unrelenting, moving sound\".\n\nBand member Eric Alan Livingston died on March 6, 2023, at the age of 38.",
