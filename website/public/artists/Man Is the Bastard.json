The band existed from 1990 to 1997, releasing mostly [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] splits, extended plays, and albums on obscure labels from around the world. By 1997, the group ended and members all went on to do other projects, such as the [[noise music|noise]] group [[Bastard Noise]], which originally started out as a Man Is the Bastard side project. They are typically seen as part of the 1990s [[powerviolence]] movement.\n\nMan Is the Bastard has dissolved but its members are involved with a number of other projects. Wood occasionally performs in the [[Los Angeles]] area as [[Bastard Noise]]. Kenyon and Connel continue to perform in progressive rock acts such as Frank Booth Youth, Bastard Lounge, ControllingHand, Lux Nova Umbra Est, and Umbra Vita. Andy Beattie continues doing vocals.
