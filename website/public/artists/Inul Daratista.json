  "description": "'''Inul Daratista''' (born '''Ainur Rokhimah''' on 21 January 1979) is a [[dangdut]] singer and performance artist from [[Pasuruan]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]]. She became nationally famous in 2003, and is known for her suggestive style of [[dancing]] that caused major controversy in Indonesia. Inul is a corrupted version of Ainur, and the singer's childhood pet name. As she began her musical career singing in a [[Rock music|rock]] band, she adopted the stage name Daratista.\n\nInul Daratista rose to national prominence after a televised January 2003 concert in [[Jakarta]]. Her dance moves, which she calls ''Goyang Inul'', [[goyang-gerudi]], or ''ngebor'' (lit. 'drilling'), quickly became the source of controversy due to her gyrating hip motions. Some [[conservative]] [[Muslim]] organizations such as the [[Indonesian Muslim Council]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: Majelis Muslimin Indonesia, abbreviated MMI) called for a ban on her concerts.  She was cited as a reason to pass a national anti-[[pornography]] bill that was drafted during the height of the controversy in mid-2003 and became a law in October 2008. Inul's dance style was also criticised by other dangdut singers, most vocally [[Rhoma Irama]], for \"corrupting\" the genre, though these criticisms did little to dent her popularity.",
