  "description": "'''Siege''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. Formed in 1981, they were active in the [[Boston hardcore]] scene from 1984 to 1985, and reunited briefly in 1991. Drummer Rob Williams and guitarist Kurt Habelt led a live ensemble of reunion performances between 2016 and 2023.\n\nIn its original incarnation, Siege paired extremely fast tempos with vocalist [[Kevin Mahoney]]'s screeches and growls in their intense style of hardcore. Though little known at the time, the band has posthumously become revered by punk and [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] fans worldwide and is now regarded as one of the pioneers of the [[grindcore]] and [[powerviolence]] subgenres.",
