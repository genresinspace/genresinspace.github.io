  "description": "'''Dave Jones''', better known as '''Zed Bias''', is an English [[electronic music]]ian based in [[Manchester]], who operates within the [[UK garage]]/[[2-step garage|2-step]], [[broken beat]] and [[UK funky]] genres, as a [[Record producer|producer]] and as a [[Disc jockey|DJ]]. He has also released material under various [[pseudonym]]s including Maddslinky and is one half of the duo [[Phuturistix]].\n\nBias is best known for his single \"Neighbourhood\" which reached No. 25 on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]] in July 2000, having created a large underground response from late 1999 in its original version. Living in [[Milton Keynes]] at the time, he collaborated with several other local artists and DJs resulting in a host of well-received tracks and remixes early in his producing career, such as \"Standard Hoodlum Issue\" with DJ Spatts ([[the Criminal Minds]]). Some of these have been released on his own Sidewinder/Sidestepper and Biasonic labels.\n\nBias started to record under the Maddslinky name in 2001, resulting in the album ''Make Your Peace'' in 2003 and a second ''Make a Change'' in 2010. Around the same time, he also became one half of the production duo [[Phuturistix]] and has been engaged in remixing duties for many well-known artists.\n\nBias' releases, which explore a more experimental or progressive side of the [[2-step garage]] sound, have been hailed as a crucial element in the establishment of [[dubstep]] as a definable sound or genre.",
