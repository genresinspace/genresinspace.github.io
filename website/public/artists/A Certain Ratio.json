  "description": "'''A Certain Ratio''' (abbreviated as '''ACR''') are an English [[post-punk]] band formed in [[Greater Manchester]] in 1977 by Peter Terrell (guitar), Simon Topping (vocals, trumpet), Jez Kerr (bass guitar, vocals), Martin Moscrop (trumpet, guitar) and Donald Johnson (drums), with Martha Tilson (vocals) joining soon after.\n\nOne of the first [[Independent music|indie]] groups to draw heavy influence from [[funk]] as well as [[disco]] and [[Latin music|Latin percussion]], the band were among the first to debut on [[Tony Wilson]]'s [[Factory Records]] in 1979 with \"All Night Party\", produced by [[Martin Hannett]]. During ACR's early years with Factory, they scored seven Top Ten UK independent releases, highlighted by \"Flight\" and \"Waterline\", and released five studio albums beginning with ''[[The Graveyard and the Ballroom]]'' (1980).\n\nFollowing late 1980s and early 1990s phases with [[A&M Records]] and [[Rob Gretton]]'s independent Robs Records, ACR was intermittently active. The group returned to the studio for its ninth studio album ''[[Mind Made Up]]'' (2008) and since then has continued to perform, with its back catalogue reissued through an arrangement with [[Mute Records]]. \n\nThey released their first studio album in twelve years, ''ACR Loco'' in September 2020, followed by three EPs ''A'', ''C'' and ''R'' in 2021, and eleventh studio album, ''1982'', in 2023. Their twelfth studio album, ''It All Comes Down to This'' was released in 2024.",
