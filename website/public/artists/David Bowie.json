  "description": "'''David Robert Jones''' (8 January 1947{{spnd}}10 January 2016), known as '''David Bowie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|i}} {{respell|BOH|ee}}), was an English singer, songwriter and actor. Regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft have had a great impact on [[popular music]].\n\nBowie studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. He released a string of unsuccessful singles with local bands and [[David Bowie (1967 album)|a self-titled solo album]] (1967) before achieving his first top-five entry on the [[UK singles chart]] with \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1969). After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the [[glam rock]] era with the [[alter ego]] [[Ziggy Stardust (character)|Ziggy Stardust]]. The success of the single \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" and its album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"[[plastic soul]]\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" and the album ''[[Young Americans]]'' (1975). In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' and released ''[[Station to Station]]''. In 1977, he again changed direction with the [[electronic music|electronic]]-inflected album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', the first of three collaborations with [[Brian Eno]] that came to be known as the [[Berlin Trilogy]]. ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (1977) and ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top-five and received critical praise.\n\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\", its album ''[[Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)]]'' and \"[[Under Pressure]]\" (a 1981 collaboration with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]). He achieved his greatest commercial success in the 1980s with ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the [[hard rock]] band [[Tin Machine]]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Jungle music|jungle]]. He also continued acting; his films included ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), ''[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' (1992), ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' (1996), and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' (2006). His last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. He returned from a decade-long recording hiatus in 2013 with ''[[The Next Day]]'' and remained musically active until [[Death of David Bowie|his death]] in 2016, two days after the release of ''[[Blackstar (album)|Blackstar]]''.\n\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million worldwide, made him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians of all time]]. He is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by David Bowie|numerous accolades]], including six [[Grammy Award]]s and four [[Brit Awards]]. Often dubbed the \"chameleon of rock\" due to his continual musical reinventions, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked him among the greatest [[Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|singers]], [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|songwriters]] and [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|artists]] of all time.
