  "description": "{{nihongo|'''Merzbow'''|メルツバウ|Merutsubau|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[noise music|noise]] project started in 1979 by Masami Akita, best known for a style of harsh noise music. Since 1980, Akita has released over 500 recordings and collaborated with numerous artists.\n\nThe name Merzbow comes from the German [[dada]] artist [[Kurt Schwitters]]' artwork ''[[Kurt Schwitters#The Merzbau|Merzbau]]'', in which Schwitters transformed the interior of his house using [[found object]]s. The name was chosen to reflect Akita's dada influence and junk art aesthetic. In addition to this, Akita has cited a wide range of musical influences from [[progressive rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[free jazz]], and early [[electronic music]]{{Sfn|Woodward|2000|p=40}} to non-musical influences like dadaism, [[surrealism]] and fetish culture.{{Sfn|Woodward|2000|p=27}} Since the early 2000s, he has been inspired by [[animal rights]] and [[environmentalism]], and began to follow a [[Veganism|vegan]], [[straight edge]] lifestyle.\n\nIn addition to being a prolific musician, he has been a writer and editor for several books and magazines in Japan, and has written several books of his own. He has written about a variety of subjects, mostly about music, [[modern art]], and [[underground culture]]. His more renowned works were on the topics of [[BDSM]] and [[Japanese bondage]]. Other art forms Akita has been interested in include painting, photography, filmmaking, and [[Butoh]] dance.\n\nIn 2000, [[Extreme Records]] released the 50&nbsp;CD box set ''[[Merzbox]]''. Akita's work has been the subject of several [[remix album]]s and at least one [[tribute album]]. This, among other achievements, has helped Merzbow to be regarded by some as the \"most important artist in noise\".",
