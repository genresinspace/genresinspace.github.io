  "description": "'''Teapacks''' (also known as '''Tipex''') ({{langx|he|טיפקס}}) is an Israeli [[band (music)|band]] that formed in 1988 as '''HaHotzaa La'Poal''' (Hebrew: {{Script/Hebrew|ההוצאה לפועל}}, ''The Execution'') in the southern Israeli city of [[Sderot]]. Originally the band was named after the [[correction fluid]] [[Tipp-Ex]], but in 1995 the transliteration was changed so as not to infringe on the well-known brand, while keeping the pronunciation and spelling in Hebrew the same.\n\nEach member of the band has a diverse background, and as a whole the band has Tunisian, Moroccan, Bulgarian, Romanian, Syrian, Polish, Russian, and Yemenite heritage. Teapacks gained popularity by bringing forward traditional Israeli-oriental music combined with light humorous hints. The [[band leader]], [[Kobi Oz]], is well known within Israel for his eccentric looks and style. The band has released eight albums plus a greatest hits collection, which collectively have sold over 300,000 copies. Teapacks has been chosen “Band of the Year” numerous times by Israeli radio stations.",
