  "description": "'''The Spinners''' are an American [[rhythm and blues]] [[vocal group]] that formed in [[Detroit, Michigan]], in 1954. They enjoyed a string of hit singles and albums during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly with producer [[Thom Bell]].  The group continues to tour, without any original members, after [[Henry Fambrough]] retired in 2023.\n\nThe group is also listed as the '''Detroit Spinners''' and the '''Motown Spinners''', due to their 1960s recordings with the [[Motown]] label. These other names were used in the UK to avoid confusion with a British folk group also called [[The Spinners (UK band)|the Spinners]]. On June 30, 1976, they received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. The Spinners were inducted into the [[National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]] in 2015 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2023.",
