Raised on a steady diet of [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[cumbia]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], as well as [[hip-hop]] and other [[club music]], Maluca's music has been described as \"experimental tropical punk, [[ghettotech]], and hip-house\". Although a bad case of stage fright kept her out of the spotlight for much of her life, a chance meeting with [[Mad Decent|Diplo]] while performing karaoke eventually led to \"El Tigeraso\", Maluca's first single.\n\nThe years 2009 and 2010 saw her touring, performing, and releasing what she calls \"tropical punk\" tracks. Since the release of her single in 2009, Maluca has recorded tracks that range from merengue mashups to kuduro to old-school deep house and focused on her stage show, which includes two dancers named the Cookies. China Food is her latest release as she prepares for a second visit to [[South by South West]].\n\nThe name ''Maluca'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a derivative of ''Mala'' which means bad or mean girl. In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''Maluca'' means a crazy or mischievous girl.",
