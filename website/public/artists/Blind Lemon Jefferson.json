  "description": "'''Lemon Henry''' \"'''Blind Lemon'''\" '''Jefferson''' (September 24, 1893 â€“ December 19, 1929) was an American [[blues]] and [[gospel music|gospel]] singer-songwriter and musician. He was one of the most popular and successful blues singers of the 1920s and has been called the \"Father of the [[Texas Blues]]\".''''''\n\nDue mainly to his high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing, Jefferson's performances were distinctive. His recordings sold well, but he was not a strong influence on younger blues singers of his generation, who could not imitate him as easily as they could other commercially successful artists. Later blues and [[rock and roll]] musicians, however, did attempt to imitate both his songs and his musical style.\n\nJefferson had an intricate and fast style of guitar playing and a particularly high-pitched voice. He was a founder of the [[Texas blues]] sound and an important influence on other blues singers and guitarists, including [[Lead Belly]] and [[Lightnin' Hopkins]].\n\nHe was the author of many songs covered by later musicians, including the classic \"[[See That My Grave Is Kept Clean]]\". Another of his songs, \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox Blues]]\", was recorded more than 30 years later by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], in a [[rockabilly]] version credited to [[Carl Perkins]], who did not credit Jefferson on his 1955 recording. Fellow blues artist [[B.B. King]] credited Jefferson as one of his biggest musical influences, next to [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Louis Jordan]] and [[T-Bone Walker]].",
