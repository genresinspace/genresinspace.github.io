  "description": "'''Tearano''' is a musical group from the southwestern region of [[Madagascar]]. They perform a [[Music of Madagascar|contemporary form]] of the traditional ''[[beko music|beko]]'' genre, fusing southern vocal harmonies and ''[[tsapiky]]'' rhythms with modern instrumentation heavily featuring synthesizers and electric guitars. The band's innovative instrumentation modernized the tsapiky sound and rendered it more radio friendly and accessible to listeners in other regions of Madagascar. The band is considered an ambassador of the musical traditions of the south, and is credited with popularizing the tsapiky genre outside of the southern region of [[Toliara]] where it originated.",
