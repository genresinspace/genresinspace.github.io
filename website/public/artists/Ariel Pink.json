  "description": "'''Ariel Marcus Rosenberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑːr|i|ɛ|l}} {{respell|AR|ee|el}}; born June 24, 1978), professionally known as '''Ariel Pink''', is an American musician, singer, and songwriter whose work draws heavily from the popular music of the 1960s–1980s. His [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and [[home recording|home-recorded]] albums proved influential to many indie musicians starting in the late 2000s. He is frequently cited as the \"godfather\" of the [[hypnagogic pop]] and [[chillwave]] movements, and he is credited with galvanizing a larger trend involving the evocation of the media, sounds, and outmoded technologies of prior decades, as well as an equal appreciation between [[high art|high]] and [[low art]] in [[independent music]].\n\nA native of [[Los Angeles]], Pink began experimenting with recording songs on an [[Stem mixing and mastering|eight-track]] [[Portastudio]] as a teenager. His early influences were artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[the Cure (band)|the Cure]], and [[R. Stevie Moore]]. The majority of [[Ariel Pink discography|his recorded output]] stems from a prolific eight-year period (1996–2003) in which he accumulated over 200 cassette tapes of material.  Virtually all of his music released in the 2000s was written and recorded before 2004, the same year he debuted on [[Animal Collective]]'s [[Paw Tracks]] label with ''[[The Doldrums (album)|The Doldrums]]'' (2000), ''[[House Arrest (album)|House Arrest]]'' (2002) and ''[[Worn Copy]]'' (2003). The albums immediately attracted a [[cult following]].\n\nIn the 2000s, Pink's unusual sound prompted a renewed critical discussion of [[Hauntology (music)|hauntological]] phenomena, for which he was a central figure. Until 2014, his records were usually credited to '''Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti''', a solo project sometimes conflated with his touring band. His fame and recognition escalated following his signing to [[4AD]] and the success of his 2010 album ''[[Before Today (album)|Before Today]]'', his first recorded in a professional studio. He then recorded three more albums – ''[[Mature Themes]]'' (2012), ''[[Pom Pom (album)|Pom Pom]]'' (2014), and ''[[Dedicated to Bobby Jameson]]'' (2017) – the last of which was recorded for [[Mexican Summer]].\n\nThroughout his career, Pink has been subject to several media controversies stemming from his occasional provocations onstage and in interviews. In 2021, he lost support from Mexican Summer following his presence in Washington D.C. during the [[January 6 United States Capitol attack|January 6 Capitol attack]]. He then formed a new band, '''Ariel Pink's Dark Side''', with whom he recorded two albums, ''The Key of Joy Is Disobedience'' (2022) and ''Never Made A Demo, Ever'' (2023).",
