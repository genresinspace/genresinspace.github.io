  "description": "'''Erasure''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|ʒ|ər}} {{respell|ə|RAY|zhər}}) are an English [[synth-pop]] duo formed in London in 1985, consisting of lead vocalist and songwriter [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] and songwriter, producer and keyboardist [[Vince Clarke]], the latter previously a co-founder of the band [[Depeche Mode]] and synth-pop duo [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]. From their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\" (1986), Erasure established themselves on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming one of the most successful acts of the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. From 1986 to 2007, the pair achieved 24 consecutive top 40 entries in the UK singles chart. By 2009, 34 of their 37 chart-eligible singles and EPs had made the UK top 40, including 17 climbing into the top 10. At the [[9th Brit Awards|1989 Brit Awards]], Erasure won the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]].\n\nErasure released their debut album ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'' in 1986. It did not perform well chart-wise, although one song from the album, \"[[Oh l'amour]]\", later became one of their biggest hits when reissued in 2003 to promote the ''[[Hits! The Very Best of Erasure]]'' compilation album.  With their second album, 1987's ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', came major success, the album reaching UK number 6 and spawning four top 20 singles with \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", \"[[It Doesn't Have to Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\", and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". Their third album, 1988's ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was a number 1, and produced further hit singles with \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\", and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". It  was followed the same year by the Christmas EP ''[[Crackers International]]'', which peaked at number 2 and included another of their most popular songs, \"[[Crackers International|Stop!]]\" . ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive UK number 1 albums, followed by ''[[Wild!]]'' (1989), the Mercury Prize nominated ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991), the compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'' (1992), and ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'' (1994). Their [[ABBA]] tribute EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'' (1992), also reached number 1 in the UK. Hit singles from these albums included \"[[Drama!]]\", \"[[Blue Savannah]]\", and \"[[Star (Erasure song)|Star]]\" from ''Wild!'', \"[[Chorus (Erasure song)|Chorus]]\", \"[[Love to Hate You]]\", and \"[[Breath of Life (Erasure song)|Breath of Life]]\" from ''Chorus'', and \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\" and \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" from ''I Say I Say I Say''. \n\nFrom 1995, the commercial success of Erasure began to fade with the atmospheric album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' (1995), then with the mixed success of ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' (1997), until the album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'' (2000) which almost passed unnoticed. A little later in the 2000s, the duo achieved a commercial rebound in a few European countries thanks to their cover of a [[Peter Gabriel]] song, \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", taken from the covers album ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' (2003), as well as the single \"[[Breathe (Erasure song)|Breathe]]\" on the album ''[[Nightbird (Erasure album)|Nightbird]]'' (2005). Subsequently, Erasure began a new commercial decline accentuated by the record crisis: the group's new albums still ranked briefly in the charts, but no new singles reached the rankings. However, a solid international fanbase allows Erasure to maintain its activity by relying on tours, online sales, as well as the copyrights attached to their catalog of past successes.\n\nOverall in their career, Erasure have written over 200 songs and have sold over 28 million albums worldwide.",
