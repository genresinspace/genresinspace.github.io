  "description": "'''Erasure''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|eɪ|ʒ|ər}} {{respell|ə|RAY|zhər}}) are an English [[synth-pop]] duo formed in London in 1985, consisting of lead vocalist and songwriter [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] and songwriter, producer and keyboardist [[Vince Clarke]], the latter previously a co-founder of the band [[Depeche Mode]] and synth-pop duo [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]. From their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\" (1986), Erasure established themselves on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming one of the most successful acts of the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. From 1986 to 2007, the pair achieved 24 consecutive top 40 entries in the UK singles chart. By 2009, 34 of their 37 chart-eligible singles and EPs had made the UK top 40, including 17 climbing into the top 10. At the [[9th Brit Awards|1989 Brit Awards]], Erasure won the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]].\n\nErasure released their debut album ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]''&nbsp;in 1986. It did not perform well chart-wise, although one song from the album, \"[[Oh l'amour]]\", later became one of their biggest hits when reissued in 2003 to promote the ''[[Hits! The Very Best of Erasure]]'' compilation album.  With their second album, 1987's ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The&nbsp;Circus]]'', came major success, the album reaching UK number 6 and spawning four top 20 singles with \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", \"[[It Doesn't Have to Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\", and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". Their third album, 1988's ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The&nbsp;Innocents]]'', was a number 1, and produced further hit singles with \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\", and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". It  was followed the same year by the Christmas EP ''[[Crackers&nbsp;International]]'', which peaked at number 2 and included another of their most popular songs, \"[[Crackers International|Stop!]]\" . ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive UK number 1 albums, followed by ''[[Wild!]]''&nbsp;(1989), the Mercury Prize nominated ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]''&nbsp;(1991), the compilation ''[[Pop!&nbsp;The&nbsp;First&nbsp;20&nbsp;Hits]]''&nbsp;(1992), and ''[[I&nbsp;Say&nbsp;I Say&nbsp;I&nbsp;Say]]''&nbsp;(1994). Their [[ABBA]] tribute EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]''&nbsp;(1992), also reached number 1 in the UK. Hit singles from these albums included \"[[Drama!]]\", \"[[Blue Savannah]]\", and \"[[Star (Erasure song)|Star]]\" from ''Wild!'', \"[[Chorus (Erasure song)|Chorus]]\", \"[[Love to Hate You]]\", and \"[[Breath of Life (Erasure song)|Breath of Life]]\" from ''Chorus'', and \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\" and \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" from ''I Say I Say I Say''. \n\nFrom 1995, the commercial success of Erasure began to fade with the atmospheric album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' (1995), then with the mixed success of ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' (1997), until the album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'' (2000) which almost passed unnoticed. A little later in the 2000s, the duo achieved a commercial rebound in a few European countries thanks to their cover of a [[Peter Gabriel]] song, \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", taken from the covers album ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' (2003), as well as the UK Top 5 single \"[[Breathe (Erasure song)|Breathe]]\" on the album ''[[Nightbird (Erasure album)|Nightbird]]'' (2005). Subsequently, Erasure began a new commercial decline accentuated by the record crisis: the group's new albums still ranked briefly in the charts.\n\nOverall in their career, Erasure have written more than 200 songs and have sold more than 28 million albums worldwide.",
