The band's first line-up also included singer Alessandro Conti and Rhapsody of Fire drummer Alex Holzwarth, who was then a member of both bands.

Their second and final album, ''[[Prometheus, Symphonia Ignis Divinus]]'', was released in 2015.\n\nFrom April 2017 to March 2018, Turilli, Leurquin, Guers, Holzwarth, and former Rhapsody of Fire vocalist Lione toured together for the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour, playing the music of the original band; in June 2018, Turilli confirmed that the band was inactive, and the following December announced that the 20th Anniversary Farewell Tour lineup now formed a new band, named [[Turilli / Lione Rhapsody]].",
