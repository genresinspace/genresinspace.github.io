  "description": "'''Mr. Pacman''' is a [[Bitpop|bitpop/gamewave]] (or as the band calls themselves, \"8-bit hero gangsta rock\") band from [[Denver, Colorado]]. Described as a [[performance art]] project as well as a band, Mr. Pacman's live shows include [[martial arts]] fighting with [[monster]]s, outrageous 1980s-style [[retro-futurism|retro-futuristic]] outfits, and their signature [[Commodore 64]]-inspired electronic music with a rock attitude. Although most musicians who use the [[MOS Technology SID]] chip do so only in the studio, Mr. Pacman uses a [[SidStation]], controlled by his keytar, live on stage, and the Silver Ghost uses a [[Commodore SX-64]] as a bass [[synthesizer]]. (Daniel Eriksson, who helped design the SidStation, was the first to use a Sidstation live on stage, at mekke 2000; [[Goto80]] was the first to use a SID chip live onstage at the ECC in 1993.) Many Mr. Pacman songs are based on songs from classic video games, such as the ''[[Mega Man (original series)|Mega Man]]'' series.",
