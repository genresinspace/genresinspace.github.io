  "description": "The '''Wings Over Jordan Choir''' was an [[African Americans|African-American]] [[a cappella]] [[Spirituals|spiritual]] [[choir]] founded and based in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]]. The choir was part of the weekly [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] [[Radio program|radio]] series, '''''Wings Over Jordan''''', created to showcase the group.\n\nDebuting over Cleveland radio station [[WHKW|WGAR]] in 1937 as ''The Negro Hour'', the radio program was broadcast on the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] from 1938 to 1947 and the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] through 1949. ''Wings Over Jordan'' broke the [[color barrier]] as the first radio program produced and hosted by African-Americans to be nationally broadcast over a network. The program was the first of its kind which was easily accessible to audiences in the [[Deep South]], featuring distinguished black church and civic leaders, [[scholar]]s and artists as guest speakers. One of the highest-rated religious radio programs in the [[United States]], it also had an international [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] audience on the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), the [[Voice of America]] (VOA), and [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio]]. The program has been credited with WGAR and CBS receiving inaugural [[Peabody Awards]] in 1941.\n\nFounded in Cleveland by [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[Glynn Thomas Settle]] (1894–1967), the choir performed concerts throughout the country during its height (often defying [[Jim Crow laws]]) and toured with the [[USO]] in support of the American [[war effort]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. Billed as one of the world's greatest Negro choirs, the Wings Over Jordan Choir is regarded as a forerunner of the [[civil rights movement]] and a driving force in the development of choral music helping to both preserve by introducing traditional spirituals to a mainstream audience.{{r|WingsFirsts}} Other versions of the group began to emerge during the 1950s, and a Cleveland-based [[Tribute act|tribute choir]] of the same name has performed since 1988.",
