  "name": "Earthstar",
  "description": "'''Earthstar''' is an [[electronic music]] group from [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Earthstar was encouraged by [[Krautrock]]/[[Kosmische Musik]]/electronic music artist, composer, and producer [[Klaus Schulze]] to relocate to [[Germany]] where they contracted with [[Sky Records]].  Schulze inspired and produced their second album, ''[[French Skyline]]''.  Earthstar is notable as the only American band who participated in Germany's Kosmische Musik/electronic music scene while still at its height.\n\nThe New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock describes Earthstar as a “wall of sound.” Wuest's vision and compositions propel the band along with composers Dennis Rea and Daniel Zongrone. The composed music doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument but rather creates a sound texture. There are credits for traditional musical instruments including sitar and vocals that may be difficult to distinguish.  Earthstar's style on ''French Skyline'' has been compared to Wolfgang Bock, Sangiuliano, and Klaus Schulze's own recordings.  Other albums have a softer style with more distinct instrumentation.\n\nEarthstar is also notable for [[Craig Wuest]]'s heavy use of the [[Mellotron]] and the rare [[Birotron]], a variation on the Mellotron that can sustain notes beyond eight seconds.",
