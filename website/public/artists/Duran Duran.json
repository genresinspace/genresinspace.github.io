The band's first major hit was \"[[Girls on Film]]\" (1981), from their [[Duran Duran (1981 album)|self-titled debut album]], the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video. The band's breakthrough second album was ''[[Rio (Duran Duran album)|Rio]]'' (1982), a worldwide hit. The songs \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\" and \"[[Rio (song)|Rio]]\" featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker [[Russell Mulcahy]] and became two of their biggest hits. Their third album, ''[[Seven and the Ragged Tiger]]'', became their only UK number one album and featured the US and UK number one single \"[[The Reflex]]\". In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single \"[[A View to a Kill (song)|A View to a Kill]]\" from the soundtrack of the [[James Bond]] [[A View to a Kill|film of the same title]].\n\nAndy Taylor and Roger Taylor both left the band before the recording of their fourth album, ''[[Notorious (Duran Duran album)|Notorious]]'' (1986), which yielded the top ten [[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|title track]]. Le Bon, Rhodes and John Taylor initially continued as a core trio, before adding guitarist [[Warren Cuccurullo]] and drummer [[Sterling Campbell]] as full-time members in 1989, though Campbell departed in 1991. The band spent the late 1980s and early 1990s releasing albums and singles to only moderate success. However, their 1993 album ''[[Duran Duran (1993 album)|Duran Duran]]'' (commonly called ''The Wedding Album''), featured two top ten worldwide hits \"[[Ordinary World (song)|Ordinary World]]\" and \"[[Come Undone (Duran Duran song)|Come Undone]]\". John Taylor left the band in 1997, though four years later, in 2001, a full reunion of the classic 1980–1985 line-up of Le Bon, Rhodes and all three Taylors took place, which led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album ''[[Astronaut (Duran Duran album)|Astronaut]]'', which reached number three in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries. The album's lead single \"[[(Reach Up for The) Sunrise]]\" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK.
