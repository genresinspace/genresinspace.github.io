The band has released three further albums: ''Living for the Other Side'' (2021), ''Holy Ghost Power'' (2022), and ''Marigold'' (2024), with their first, third, and fourth albums appearing near the top of the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' bluegrass chart]].\n\nAustin Litke and [[Thomas Joseph White]], both Dominican priests, founded the band and initially played [[Irish traditional music]]. The band expanded to comprise Litke, White, and eight Dominican [[Religious brother|brothers]] in 2017; Litke and White remain band members with six other Dominicans in 2024.\n\nThe band's name references a letter by author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. She frequently read [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' and believed that her readers should think of her not as a \"[[hillbilly]] [[nihilist]]\" but as a \"hillbilly [[Thomist]]\".
