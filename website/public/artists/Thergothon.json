  "name": "Thergothon",
  "description": "'''Thergothon''' was a Finnish [[funeral doom]] band active from 1990 to 1993. They are one of the pioneers of the funeral doom subgenre. The band only released one demo, ''[[Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth]]'' (1991), and one album, ''[[Stream from the Heavens]]'' (1994). Their sound was extremely slow and dirge-like in long pieces, which combined heavy guitar riffs, extremely deep [[death grunt]]s and sparse lead guitar melodies. They disbanded a year before the release of the album and its members focused on other projects.\n\nNiko Sirkiä and Jori Sjöroos went on to form [[This Empty Flow]], which marked a distinct stylistic departure from Thergothon. The project began as somewhat of a [[shoegaze]] band, taking cues from groups like [[Slowdive]], but ended up as more in the area of [[trip hop]]. Lately, Sjöroos has gained reputation for composing songs for popular Finnish pop rock act [[PMMP]]. Sirkiä, later known as Niko Skorpio, works as a visual artist and records experimental electronic music. He also used to run a record label called Some Place Else.",
