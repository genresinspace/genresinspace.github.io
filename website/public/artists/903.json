  "description": "'''Antoine Caliste Domino Jr.''' (February 26, 1928&nbsp;â€“ October 24, 2017), known as '''Fats Domino''', was an American singer-songwriter and pianist. One of the pioneers of [[rock and roll]] music, Domino sold more than 65 million records. Born in [[New Orleans]] to a [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] family, Domino signed to [[Imperial Records]] in 1949. His first single \"[[The Fat Man (song)|The Fat Man]]\" is cited by some historians as the [[origins of rock and roll|first rock and roll single]] and the first to sell more than 1 million copies. Domino continued to work with the song's co-writer [[Dave Bartholomew]], contributing his distinctive rolling piano style to [[Lloyd Price]]'s \"[[Lawdy Miss Clawdy]]\" (1952) and scoring a string of mainstream hits beginning with \"[[Ain't That a Shame]]\" (1955). Between 1955 and 1960, he had eleven Top 10 US [[popular music|pop]] hits. By 1955, five of his records had sold more than a million copies, being certified gold.\n\nDomino was shy and modest by nature but made a significant contribution to the rock and roll genre. [[Elvis Presley]] declared Domino a \"huge influence on me when I started out\" and when they first met in 1959, described him as \"the real king of rock 'n' roll\". [[The Beatles]] were also heavily influenced by Domino.\n\nFour of Domino's records were named to the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] for their significance: \"[[Blueberry Hill]]\", \"Ain't That a Shame\", \"[[Walking to New Orleans (song)|Walking to New Orleans]]\" and \"The Fat Man\". He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as part of its first group of inductees in 1986. The [[Associated Press]] estimates that during his career, Domino \"sold more than 110 million records\".",
