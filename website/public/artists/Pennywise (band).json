  "description": "'''Pennywise''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from [[Hermosa Beach, California]], formed in 1988. The band took its name from the antagonist in [[Stephen King]]'s horror novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' known as [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown]].\n\nBetween their 1991 [[Pennywise (album)|self-titled]] debut and 2005's ''[[The Fuse (Pennywise album)|The Fuse]]'', Pennywise released an album every two years on [[Epitaph Records]], a label owned by [[Bad Religion]] guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]]. To date, the band has released twelve full-length [[studio album]]s, one [[live album]], two [[Extended play|EPs]] and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, ''[[About Time (Pennywise album)|About Time]]'', which peaked at number ninety-six on the [[Billboard 200]], and number fifty-five on Australia's [[ARIA Charts]]. The band's mainstream success coincided with a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands [[NOFX]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[Blink-182]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Lagwagon]], and [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]. By 2007, the band had independently sold over three million records worldwide.\n\nPennywise's current line-up consists of [[Jim Lindberg]] (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass), and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist [[Jason Thirsk]] died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by [[Ignite (band)|Ignite]] singer [[Zoltán Téglás|Zoli Téglás]]. With Téglás, the band recorded their tenth studio album, ''[[All or Nothing (Pennywise album)|All or Nothing]]'', which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after Téglás was sidelined by a back injury.",
