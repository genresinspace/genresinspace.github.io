  "description": "'''William A. Penno''' (1843â€“1929), known by his stage name '''William A. Huntley''', was a composer, music teacher, and vocal and instrumental performer in [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] and [[vaudeville]] traditions. Playing his 5-string banjo before crowds that came to number in the low thousands, he sang in a high tenor and played his banjo bare fingered, picking the strings in a style today named \"[[Banjo#Classic era, 1880s-1910s|classic banjo]].\" His published compositions include banjo instrumentals and [[parlor music]].  Huntley spent his working life performing and teaching in the off season. He performed throughout the United States and toured Europe as a part of several different minstrel groups. A highlight of his performing career was to play before the Prince and Princess of Wales, about 1880 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London. He moved away from minstrel shows by the 1880s, and \"took pride\" that he could perform without [[blackface]] stage makeup. He focused on building respectability for the banjo, through teaching, composition, and performance recitals. He was featured in the [[Samuel Swaim Stewart|S. S. Stewart Company]]'s catalog (showing that art-banjo promoter Stewart recognized his talent) and began to play the company's [[banjeaurine]]. In 1888 he performed before a crowd of 2,000 people in his hometown, [[Providence, Rhode Island]].",
