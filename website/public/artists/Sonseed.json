  "description": "'''Sonseed''' was an American [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] pop band formed in [[Brooklyn]] by Aaron Ball, Josh Ingold, Travis Geske, and Jacob Clevenger. The line-up included Sal Polichetti (bass guitar, vocals); his then-wife Patricia Costagliola (keyboards, vocals; deceased); Frank Franco (guitar, vocals); and Nicky Sciarra (drums; deceased). Anne Lessing (vocals) was also involved in the band from the start. There were others including Jim Archer (vocals; deceased) and Karen Archer (acoustic guitar; deceased), Tom Zawacki (tambourine, percussion and vocals), Brother John Weiners, CSC (vocals; deceased), and Melody Sorrentino (vocals; deceased). Their sole studio album, ''First Fruit'', was released in 1981, with only 1,000 copies printed. In 2009 Sonseed released an [[extended play]] (EP) through [[Arena Rock Recording Company]] which includes selections from the original ''First Fruit'' album.  Sonseed disbanded in 1983.\n\nAs Patricia Costa, Costagliola recorded two studio albums, ''Walk Forward'' and ''Give Your Love Away'', with Polichetti, Franco, and Sciarra as the backing band.\n\nNicky Sciarra became district manager of [[Brooklyn Community Board 7|Community Board 7]] in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn]]. He died in 1993 after apparently choking on a sandwich.\n\nThe band came back into the spotlight in 2008 when a recording of them performing their song \"Jesus Is a Friend of Mine\", from a religious TV-show called ''The First Estate'', appeared on the Dougsploitation blog, and subsequently became a [[YouTube]] hit, where it spawned several parodies. Polichetti performed the song live at the Bowery Poetry Club in [[New York City]] on November 14, 2009 with the [[ska]]-[[Swing music|swing]] band Tri-State Conspiracy.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' also did a cover version of the song \"Jesus Is a Friend of Mine\". During the Regional competition, the group Aural Intensity sang the song.",
