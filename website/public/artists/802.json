  "description": "'''Cardinal Sin''' are an [[extreme metal]] band formed in 1995 by ex-[[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] member [[John Zwetsloot]]. In 1996, they released a 4-track EP called ''[[Spiteful Intents]]'', which featured a trademark classical composition by Zwetsloot. Having disbanded after the EP, they reformed in 2003 with a partially new lineup, but have yet to release anything beyond ''Spiteful Intents''.\n\nDaniel Ekeroth described their musical style as \"typical mid-90s death/[[Thrash metal|thrash]]\". ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' journalist Robert MÃ¼ller wrote that since the group were focussed around the guitarists John Zwetsloot and Devo Andersson there were no doubts about the technical quality, though the EP's sound was \"established and all to well-known\".",
