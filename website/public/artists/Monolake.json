  "name": "Monolake",
  "description": "'''Monolake''' is a German [[electronic music]] project founded in 1995, initially consisting of members Gerhard Behles and [[Robert Henke]]. Monolake is now being perpetuated by Henke while Behles has focused on running the [[music software]] company [[Ableton]], which they founded in 1999 together with Bernd Roggendorf. In 2004, Torsten Pröfrock became a member of the project.\nMonolake is now perpetuated by Henke alone.\n\nMonolake's minimal, [[Dub music|dub]]-influenced [[techno]] helped establish the sound of the [[Basic Channel|Chain Reaction]] label, also located in Berlin, which subsequently used their own [ml/i] (''Monolake / Imbalance Computer Music'') label for the group's output. Both current members of Monolake have their own solo projects, with Henke releasing under his own name and Pröfrock as \"T++\" and \"Various Artists.\"\n\nIn 2008, T++ followed [[Ricardo Villalobos]] in bridging the gap between [[minimal techno]] and [[dubstep]] by [[remix]]ing [[Shackleton (musician)|Shackleton]]'s ''Death Is Not Final'' for the [[Skull Disco]] label.\n\nIn 2009, Henke appeared in the electronic music documentary ''[[Speaking In Code]]'', which presented the completion of the [[Monodeck]]. As of 2012, Henke has been designing a new form of live show syncing surround-sound audio stems with visual loops, allowing for improvisation.\n\nMonolake is named after [[Mono Lake]], which is east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]].",
