  "description": "'''The Killers''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, in 2001 by [[Brandon Flowers]] (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and [[Dave Keuning]] (lead guitar, backing vocals). After the band went through a number of short-term bassists and drummers, [[Mark Stoermer]] (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and [[Ronnie Vannucci Jr.]] (drums, percussion) joined in 2002.\n\nThe Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]]: ''[[Hot Fuss]]'' (2004), ''[[Sam's Town]]'' (2006), ''[[Day & Age]]'' (2008), ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]'' (2012), ''[[Wonderful Wonderful (The Killers album)|Wonderful Wonderful]]'' (2017), ''[[Imploding the Mirage]]'' (2020), and ''[[Pressure Machine]]'' (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities [[compilation album|compilation]], ''[[Sawdust (album)|Sawdust]]'' (2007); a live album, ''[[Live from the Royal Albert Hall]]'' (2009); two [[Greatest hits album|greatest-hits albums]], ''[[Direct Hits (The Killers album)|Direct Hits]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rebel Diamonds]]'' (2023); and a Christmas compilation, ''[[Don't Waste Your Wishes]]'' (2016).\n\nSince 2016 and 2017, respectively, Stoermer and Keuning have had extended hiatuses from the band. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer participated in recording sessions for ''Wonderful Wonderful'' and ''Imploding the Mirage'', and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording ''Pressure Machine'', which was released in 2021. [[Ted Sablay]], who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton assumed the role of bassist in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards, respectively, live.\n\nThe Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the U.S. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Wembley Stadium]], [[Glastonbury Festival]] in [[Glastonbury 2007|2007]] and [[Glastonbury 2019|2019]], and [[Electric Picnic]] in Ireland in 2023.",
