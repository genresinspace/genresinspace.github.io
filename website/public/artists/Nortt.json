  "description": "'''Nortt''' is a Danish [[funeral doom metal]] project maintained by a musician who goes by an [[eponymous]] pseudonym. The project was founded in 1995 and the sole member describes his music as \"pure depressive black funeral doom metal\". In terms of lyrics and imagery (for instance the use of [[corpse paint]]) he is akin to other [[black metal]] acts, while the sound of his music is closer to [[doom metal]].\n\nOn his official website Nortt reveals a fascination with [[darkness]], [[night]], [[nihilism]], [[solitude]], [[wiktionary:misery|misery]], [[misanthropy]] and [[death]]. In an interview he remarked: \"Death ... is viewed as an inevitable and alluring phenomenon. Death is described from the perspective of the dying and from the dead. The uncertainty of death is preached as more thrilling than the well-known pain of life.\" He is a self-proclaimed [[nihilism|nihilist]], and thinks that religion is for the weak. While he despises religion, he views the [[occult]] and old (pre-[[Christianity|Christian]], [[pagan]]) religions with respect. Nortt believes that it takes strength to be a [[Satanism|Satanist]], because of its [[existentialism]] and free thought.\n\nFor his third full-length album, Galgenfrist, he signed with Italian underground label [[Avantgarde Music]].",
