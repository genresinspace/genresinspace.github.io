  "description": "'''Dead Infection''' was a Polish [[goregrind]] band, that was founded in 1990 by Cyjan and Domin (ex members of [[grindcore]] band Front Terror). Since their formation, the band has released a few full-length albums, and 7-inch EPs. They are the second band from Poland after [[Vader (band)|Vader]] that made a deal to release a CD/LP with a non-European label. Their second album, ''A Chapter Of Accidents'', is considered by many to be among the milestones of goregrind music. They played numerous live shows around the world, across Europe, the United States, South America, Mexico, and Japan. In February 2020, Cyjan died, which led to the group's disbandment.",
