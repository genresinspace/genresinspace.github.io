[[Scottish people|Scottish]] musician [[Bill Drummond]] (alias King Boy D) and [[English people|English]] musician [[Jimmy Cauty]] (alias Rockman Rock) began by releasing [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-inspired and [[sampling (music)|sample]]-heavy records as the JAMs. As the Timelords, they recorded the [[UK Singles Chart]] number-one single \"[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]\", and documented the process of making a hit record in a book ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]''. As the KLF, Drummond and Cauty pioneered [[stadium house]] (rave music with a pop-rock production and sampled crowd noise) and, with their 1990 LP ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'', the [[ambient house]] genre. The KLF released a series of international hits on their own KLF Communications record label and became the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991.\n\nFrom the outset, the KLF adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novels ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', making [[anarchism|anarchic]] [[situationist International|situationist]] manifestations, including the [[vandalism|defacement]] of [[billboard|billboard adverts]], the posting of cryptic advertisements in ''[[New Musical Express]]'' (''NME'') and the mainstream press, as well as unusual performances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. In collaboration with [[Extreme Noise Terror]] at the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]] in February 1992, they fired [[machine gun]] [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance pre-announced the KLF's departure from the music business and, in May of that year, they [[deletion (music industry)|deleted]] their entire [[Music catalog|back-catalogue]]. Drummond and Cauty established the [[K Foundation]] and sought to subvert the [[art world]], staging an [[K Foundation art award|alternative art award]] for the Worst Artist of the Year, and [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burning one million pounds sterling]] (approximately £2.35m or €2.75m as of 2022).\n\nThe duo have released a small number of new tracks since 1992, as the K Foundation, [[the One World Orchestra]], and in 1997, as [[Fuck the Millennium|2K]]. Drummond and Cauty reappeared in 2017 as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, releasing the novel ''[[2023: A Trilogy|2023]]'', and rebooting an earlier campaign to build a \"People's Pyramid\". In January 2021, the band began uploading their previously deleted catalogue onto [[Streaming service provider|streaming services]], in [[Compilation album|compilations]].",
