  "description": "'''God Is My Co-Pilot''' (often abbreviated as GodCo) is a [[no wave]] [[queercore]] band from New York City formed in 1991. The two primary members throughout the 90s were the openly queer couple of vocalist Sharon Topper and guitarist Craig Flanagin. The last recordings with Topper were made in 1998 (though the group continued to perform occasionally until 2012).\n\nThere was no further activity until 2018 when the band released a demo on both cassette and Bandcamp, began playing frequent shows in NYC, and toured the UK. The current line-up consists of Flanagin playing guitar, Normandy Sherwood (of the [[National Theater of the United States of America]]) on vocals & electronics, long-standing members Jason Blackkat on bass, Jer Reid on guitar, and Fredrik Haake on drums, with new members Hajnal Pivnick on violin, and [[Kevin Shea (musician)|Kevin Shea]] on drums.\n\nThe group has been recording new music since 2018; both a single and an album drawn from these recordings, which include contributions from cellist [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]], drummer Genny Slag, and guitarist [[Half Japanese|Mark Jickling]], are slated for release in 2022.\n\nGod Is My Co-Pilot is known for being prolific (see discography below). All of their material has been released on [[independent record labels]] or self-released. Their own self-run label ''The Making Of Americans'' (named after [[The Making of Americans|the novel of the same name]] by [[Gertrude Stein]]) released music by [[Jad Fair]], [[Cat Power]], [[DQE (band)|Dairy Queen Empire]], Dawson, and [[The Scissor Girls]] among others.\n\nFormer members of God Is My Co-Pilot include keyboardist [[Anthony Coleman]], vocalist/bassist [[Fly (artist)|Fly]]; bassists James Garrison, Alex Klein, Daria Grace and Ann Rupel; cellist [[Fred Lonberg-Holm]]; and drummers Dan Brown, Michael Evans, Christine Bard and [[The Gunga Din|Siobhan Duffy]].\n\nThe group is often joined by guest musicians. These have included [[Frank London]], [[Kenny Wollesen]], [[Weasel Walter|Sandy Ewen]], [[Margaret Fiedler McGinnis]], [[Elliott Sharp]], [[Marion Coutts]], [[Borbetomagus|Jim Sauter]], [[Catherine Jauniaux]], [[Gen Ken Montgomery]], [[Martha and the Muffins|Andy Haas]], [[John Zorn]] and [[Jad Fair]].\n\nThe band's lyrics frequently address [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[gender]]. The band states, in their song, We Signify, \"...We're co-opting rock, the language of sexism, to address gender identity on its own terms of complexity....\" They occasionally sing in languages other than English: some of their output has been in [[French language|French]], [[Quebec French|Quebecois]], [[Cajun English|Cajun]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]], [[Yiddish]], [[German language|German]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], among others. Their sound has been described as [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[noise rock]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[avant-garde jazz|avant jazz]]. ''Stay Free'' zine said of the music, \"We hear a new sound, 'free punk' we'll call it.\"",
