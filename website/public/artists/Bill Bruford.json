  "description": "'''William Scott Bruford''' (born 17 May 1949) is an English drummer and percussionist who first gained prominence as a founding member of the progressive rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. After leaving Yes in 1972, Bruford spent the rest of the 1970s recording and touring with [[King Crimson]] (1972–1974), [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] (1975), and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]] (1978), as well as touring with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] (1976). In 1978, he formed his own group, [[Bruford (band)|Bruford]], which was active until 1980.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Bruford returned to King Crimson for three years (1981–1984), collaborated with several artists (including [[Patrick Moraz]] and [[David Torn]]), and formed his own electric jazz band [[Earthworks (band)|Earthworks]] in 1986. He then played with his former Yes bandmates in [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]], which eventually led to a very brief second stint in Yes. Bruford played in King Crimson for his third and final tenure from 1994 to 1997, then continued with a new acoustic configuration of Earthworks.\n\nIn 2009, Bruford announced his retirement from professional drumming. He pursued other projects, including the operation of his two record labels, Summerfold and Winterfold, releasing an autobiography, and speaking and writing about music. In 2016, Bruford received a [[PhD]] in Music from the [[University of Surrey]]. That year, Bruford ranked No. 16 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} list of the \"100 Greatest Drummers of All Time\". In 2017, Bruford was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Yes. In 2022, after a 13-year hiatus, he returned to live performance as a member of the Pete Roth Trio.",
