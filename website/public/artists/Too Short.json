A pioneer of [[West Coast hip-hop]], Shaw was among the first acts to receive recognition in the genre during the late 1980s. His lyrics were often based on [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimping]] and [[promiscuity]], but also drug culture and street survival; exemplified respectively in his most popular singles \"[[Blow the Whistle (song)|Blow the Whistle]]\" and \"[[The Ghetto (Too Short song)|The Ghetto]]\". He is one of few acts to have worked with both [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] during the heights of their respective careers. \n\nShaw began recording in 1983, and cultivated a regional following with three independent projects tailored for his native [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. His fourth album, ''[[Born to Mack]]'' (1987) sold an estimated 50,000 units from Shaw's car trunk, leading to a commercial re-issue by [[Jive Records]] the following year. His fifth album, ''[[Life Is... Too Short]]'' (1989), received [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|double platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and became his first entry on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. His sixth album, ''[[Short Dog's In The House]]'' (1990), peaked at number 20 on the chart and spawned the single \"The Ghetto\", which became his first and highest-charting entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as a lead artist. His next four albums—''[[Shorty the Pimp]]'' (1992), ''[[Get in Where You Fit In]]'' (1993), ''[[Cocktails (album)|Cocktails]]'' (1995), and ''[[Gettin' It (Album Number Ten)]]'' (1996)—each peaked within the top ten of the ''Billboard'' 200 and received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certifications by the RIAA. \n\nIn 1988, he formed the group [[the Dangerous Crew]] with Oakland-based rappers and producers, and in 2020, he formed the West Coast hip hop group [[Mount Westmore]] with frequent collaborators [[Ice Cube]], [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[E-40]]. In 2006, he founded the record label [[#Up All Nite Records|Up All Nite Records]], through which he signed the [[hyphy]] group [[The Pack (group)|the Pack]] (which included then-unknown rapper [[Lil B]]).",
