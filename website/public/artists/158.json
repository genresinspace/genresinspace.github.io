  "description": "'''Frank Grillo''' (born '''Francisco Raúl Gutiérrez Grillo'''; December 3, 1909 – April 15, 1984) known professionally as '''Machito''' (previously as '''Macho'''), was a Latin jazz musician who helped refine [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] and create both [[Cubop]] and [[salsa music]]. He was raised in Havana with his sister, singer [[Graciela]].\n\nIn New York City, Machito formed the [[Afro-Cubans (band)|Afro-Cubans]] in 1940, and with [[Mario Bauzá]] as musical director, brought together Cuban rhythms and [[big band]] arrangements in one group. He made numerous recordings from the 1940s to the 1980s, many with Graciela as singer. Machito changed to a smaller ensemble format in 1975, touring Europe extensively. He brought his son and daughter into the band, and received a [[Grammy Award]] in 1983, one year before he died.\n\nMachito's music had an effect on the careers of many musicians who played in the Afro-Cubans over the years, and on those who were attracted to Latin jazz after hearing him. [[George Shearing]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Cab Calloway]] and [[Stan Kenton]] credited Machito as an influence. An intersection in [[East Harlem]] is named \"Machito Square\" in his honor.",
