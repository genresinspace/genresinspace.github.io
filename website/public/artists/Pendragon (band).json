  "name": "Pendragon",
  "description": "'''Pendragon''' are an English [[neo-prog]] band established in 1978 in [[Stroud, Gloucestershire]] as '''Zeus Pendragon''' by guitarist and vocalist Nick Barrett. The word ''Zeus'' was dropped before the band started recording, as the members decided it was too long to look good on a T-shirt. There were a few personnel changes in the early days, but since 1986 the lineup has remained relatively stable (with only the drummer changing several times since then) and the band are still active as of 2025.",
