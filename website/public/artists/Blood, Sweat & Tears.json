BS&T has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel and has encompassed a wide range of musical styles. Their sound has merged [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music]] with [[big band]] [[jazz]].\n\nThe group's [[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|self-titled second album]] spent seven weeks atop the U.S. charts in 1969 and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1970. It contained the hit recordings \"[[And When I Die]]\", \"[[You've Made Me So Very Happy]]\", and \"[[Spinning Wheel (song)|Spinning Wheel]]\".

The group has also adapted music from [[Erik Satie]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]] into their arrangements.\n\nThe group was inspired by the \"brass-rock\" of [[the Buckinghams]] and their producer, [[James William Guercio]], as well as the [[Maynard Ferguson]] Orchestra. BS&T's success paralleled that of similarly configured ensembles such as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] (another group produced by Guercio) and the [[Electric Flag]], but by the mid-1970s the group's popularity had declined.",
