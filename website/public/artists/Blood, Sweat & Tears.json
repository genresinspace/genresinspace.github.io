  "description": "'''Blood, Sweat & Tears''' (also known as \"'''BS&T'''\") is an American [[Jazz fusion#Jazz rock|jazz rock]] music group founded in [[New York City]] in 1967, noted for combining a [[Brass instrument|brass]] section with rock band instrumentation. BS&T has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel and has encompassed a wide range of musical styles. Their sound has merged [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music]] with [[big band]] [[jazz]].\n\nThe group's second album, [[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|''Blood, Sweat & Tears'']], spent seven weeks atop the U.S. charts in 1969 and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1970. It contained the hit recordings \"[[And When I Die]]\", \"[[You've Made Me So Very Happy]]\", and \"[[Spinning Wheel (song)|Spinning Wheel]]\". All of these peaked at number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The follow-up album, ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears 3]]'', also reached number 1 in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to original music, the group is known for arrangements of popular songs by [[Laura Nyro]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carole King]], [[the Band]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Billie Holiday]] and many others. The group has also adapted music from [[Erik Satie]], [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]] into their arrangements.\n\nThe group was inspired by the \"brass-rock\" of [[the Buckinghams]] and their producer, [[James William Guercio]], as well as the [[Maynard Ferguson]] Orchestra. BS&T's success paralleled that of similarly configured ensembles such as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] (another group produced by Guercio) and the [[Electric Flag]], but by the mid-1970s the group's popularity began a decline.",
