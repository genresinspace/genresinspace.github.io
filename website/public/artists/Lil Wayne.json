  "description": "'''Dwayne Michael Carter Jr.''' (born September{{spaces}}27, 1982), known professionally as '''Lil Wayne''', is an American rapper. He is often regarded as one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation, as well as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Born and raised in [[New Orleans]], he was discovered by hometown rapper [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] in 1993 and signed with his record label, [[Cash Money Records]], at age eleven. He emerged as the label's [[Wikt:flagship|flagship]] artist until his departure in 2018.\n\nCarter was first placed in a duo with Cash Money labelmate [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]] in 1994—known collectively as the B.G.'z—and they released the album ''True Story'' that year, although Carter (at the time known as Baby D) appeared on only three of its tracks. Carter and B.G. then formed the Southern hip-hop group [[Hot Boys]] with labelmates [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] and [[Turk (rapper)|Turk]] in 1997, and released their debut album, ''[[Get It How U Live!]]'' that year. The Hot Boys gained mainstream success after the release of their second album ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (album)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'' (1999) and their appearance on B.G.'s single, \"[[Bling Bling (song)|Bling Bling]]\". The group briefly disbanded after the album due to each member (besides Carter) parting ways with the label, although one further album—''[[Let 'Em Burn]]'' (2003)—was released.\n\nCarter's debut studio album, ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'' (1999), was his breakthrough as a solo artist, quickly achieving commercial success. It was followed by ''[[Lights Out (Lil Wayne album)|Lights Out]]'' (2000) and ''[[500 Degreez]]'' (2003). Carter is credited with revolutionising the [[mixtape]] scene with his innovative approach in the 2000s. His fourth and fifth albums, ''[[Tha Carter]]'' (2004) and ''[[Tha Carter II]]'' (2005), both debuted within the top five of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received critical acclaim. His sixth album, ''[[Tha Carter III]]'' (2008), yielded the pinnacle of Wayne's career, with first-week sales of over one million units domestically. It won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] and was supported by his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-number one single \"[[Lollipop (Lil Wayne song)|Lollipop]]\" (featuring [[Static Major]]), and the top-ten singles \"[[A Milli]]\" and \"[[Got Money]]\" (featuring [[T-Pain]]). \n\nCarter's seventh studio album, ''[[Rebirth (Lil Wayne album)|Rebirth]]'' (2010), experimented with [[rap rock]] and was released to generally negative critical reception. A month after its release, he began serving an 8-month jail sentence for criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in 2007. His eighth album, ''[[I Am Not a Human Being]]'' (2010), was released during his incarceration, while his ninth album, ''[[Tha Carter IV]]'' (2011), followed months after his release from prison. Despite mixed reviews, ''Tha Carter IV'' sold 964,000 units in its first-week in the U.S. His twelfth studio album, ''[[Tha Carter V]]'' (2018)—preceded by ''[[I Am Not a Human Being II]]'' (2013) and ''[[Free Weezy Album]]'' (2015)—was released following long-term delays and label disputes, and was met with 480,000 in first-week sales. His thirteenth album, [[Funeral (Lil Wayne album)|''Funeral'']] (2020), became his fifth non-consecutive number one album. He released his fourteenth album, ''[[Tha Carter VI]]'', in June 2025.\n\nCarter has sold over 120 million records worldwide, including over 25 million albums and 95 million digital tracks in the U.S, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]]. He has won five [[Grammy Awards]], eleven [[BET Awards]], four [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and eight [[NAACP Image Awards]]. On September{{spaces}}27, 2012, he became the first male artist to surpass [[Elvis Presley]] with the most entries on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with 109 songs. Carter founded the record label [[Young Money Entertainment]] in 2005, which has signed artists including [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Tyga]] and [[Nicki Minaj]].",
