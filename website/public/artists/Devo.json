Their classic line-up consisted of two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs ([[Mark Mothersbaugh|Mark]] and [[Bob Mothersbaugh|Bob]]) and the Casales ([[Gerald Casale|Gerald]] and [[Bob Casale|Bob]]), along with [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]]. The band had a No. 14 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' chart]] hit in 1980 with the single \"[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]\", the song that gave the band mainstream popularity.\n\nDevo's music and visual presentation (including stage shows and costumes) mingle [[kitsch]] science fiction themes, [[deadpan]] [[Surreal humour|surrealist humor]] and mordantly [[satire|satirical]] [[social commentary]]. The band's namesake, the [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[social theory]] of \"de-evolution\", was an integral concept in their early work, which was marked by experimental and dissonant [[art punk]] that merged rock music with [[electronic music|electronics]]. Their output in the 1980s embraced [[synth-pop]] and a more mainstream, less conceptual style, though the band's satirical and quirky humor remained intact. Their music has proven influential on subsequent movements, particularly on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative rock]] artists. Devo (most enthusiastically Gerald Casale) was also a pioneer of the [[music video]] format.",
