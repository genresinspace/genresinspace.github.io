  "description": "'''Lust Control''' is a [[Christian punk|Christian]] [[thrash punk]] band, originally formed in 1988. They are known for their explicit lyrical content, which is devoted to matters of sexual [[sexual purity|purity]] and sin, including [[sexual abstinence|abstinence]], [[masturbation]], [[pornography]], [[sexual education|sex ed]], and related topics. For their unwavering views on sexual purity, ''CCM'' magazine has called Lust Control \"the [[Josh McDowell]] of the [[Christian rock]] world.\" Musically they have been likened to [[The Ramones]] or [[The Dead Milkmen]]. The band formed as a joke and was not meant for long term exposure, which has led some to refer to it as a Christian version of [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]. Lust Control received the title of \"The Worst Christian Band of the Decade\" for the 1990s from ''[[HM (magazine)|HM]]''.\n\nThe band's creators see themselves as performing a legitimate ministry with a message which is often marginalized or poorly approached in churches and completely taboo in [[contemporary Christian music]]. For its creators, the goal was to emphasize [[Divine grace|grace]] and [[forgiveness]] rather than sin; to that end the band offers [[Bible study (Christian)|devotional studies]] of the topics presented. The band has come under attack from groups on the [[Christian right]], who take issue with their explicit lyrics and musical style. Lust Control has released three albums of original material and an equal number of compilation albums.",
