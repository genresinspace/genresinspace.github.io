Born in [[Champaign, Illinois]], Ludacris moved to [[Atlanta]], Georgia, at age nine, where he first began rapping. Starting out with a brief stint as a [[disc jockey|DJ]], he formed his own record label, [[Disturbing tha Peace]] in the late 1990s to independently release his debut studio album ''[[Incognegro]]'' (1999). After its single, \"[[What's Your Fantasy]]\" (featuring [[Shawnna]]), became a top 40 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the album was re-released by [[Def Jam Recordings]] as his major label debut, ''[[Back for the First Time]]'' (2000).

Throughout his career, Ludacris has scored two number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 as a lead artist: \"[[Stand Up (Ludacris song)|Stand Up]]\" (featuring Shawnna) and \"[[Money Maker]]\" (featuring Pharrell), as well as three singles which did so as a guest performer: [[Usher (musician)|Usher]]'s \"[[Yeah!

The following year, he guest featured on [[Justin Bieber]]'s single \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which remains one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United States#11× Platinum or higher|highest-certified singles]] of all time in the United States.\n\nLudacris is cited as one of the first [[Southern hip hop|Dirty South]] rappers to achieve mainstream success in the early 2000s. He is the recipient of three [[Grammy Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]], a [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards|Critics' Choice Award]] and an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award]].
