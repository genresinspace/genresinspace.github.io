  "description": "'''Los Campesinos!''' are a seven-piece [[indie pop]] band from [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], formed in early 2006 at [[Cardiff University]]. The band has seen several lineup changes – lead vocalist Gareth David Paisey and guitarists Neil Turner and Tom Bromley are the only remaining original members, now joined by guitarist Rob Taylor, keyboardist Kim Paisey, bassist Matt Fidler and drummer Jason Adelinia.\n\nInfluenced by the [[twee pop]] movement, the band released their debut studio album, ''[[Hold on Now, Youngster...]]'', in February 2008, and followed up with ''[[We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed]]'', in October that year. Both receiving favourable reviews by critics, the former was described by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' as a \"giddy, tuneful love note to individuality, pathos – and everything else indie pop built its name on\". Their third album, ''[[Romance Is Boring]]'' (2010), saw the band expanding their \"already sizeable instrumental palette\". Since then, Los Campesinos! have issued [[Los Campesinos! discography|four more studio albums]], with ''[[All Hell (Los Campesinos! album)|All Hell]]'' (2024) being their most recent release and highest charting album, to date.\n\nIn 2021, ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' included Los Campesinos! among the 200 most important artists from the site's first 25 years, and described the group as \"the 21st century's most endearing [[Cult following|cult band]].\"",
