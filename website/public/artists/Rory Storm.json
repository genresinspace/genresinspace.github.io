Born in [[Liverpool]], Storm was the singer and leader of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, a Liverpudlian band who were contemporaries of [[the Beatles]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nThe Hurricanes were one of the most popular acts on the Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] club scenes during their existence, although their attempt at a recording career was not successful. They released only two singles (and one additional compilation track) during their early 1960s heyday, and none of their material made the charts. Their second and final single was a version of the ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' song \"[[America (Leonard Bernstein song)|America]]\", and was produced by the Beatles' manager [[Brian Epstein]].",
