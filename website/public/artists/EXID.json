  "description": "'''EXID''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|_|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|_|aɪ|_|ˈ|d|iː}}; {{korean|이엑스아이디}}; initialism for \"Exceed in Dreaming\") is a South Korean [[girl group]] formed in 2012. The group consists of five members: [[Heo Sol-ji|Solji]], [[Elly (rapper)|Elly]], [[Hani (singer)|Hani]], [[Seo Hye-lin|Hyelin]], and [[Park Jeong-hwa|Jeonghwa]]. EXID debuted in February 2012, with the single \"Whoz That Girl\". Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2014 that the group unexpectedly gained popularity with the single \"[[Up & Down (EXID song)|Up & Down]]\", which reached number one on the [[Gaon Singles Chart]] four months after release due to a fan-recording of a live performance becoming a [[viral video]].\n\nEXID released their second EP ''[[Ah Yeah (EP)|Ah Yeah]]'' in April 2015, to commercial success, and followed this with their first studio album ''[[Street (EXID album)|Street]]'' (2016) and various other EPs over the years. In May 2019, EXID announced its indefinite hiatus for Korean group activities due to various members leaving their agency [[Banana Culture]], but remained active in their Japanese releases such as their studio albums [[Trouble (EXID album)|''Trouble'']] (2019) and ''[[B.L.E.S.S.E.D]]'' (2020). EXID returned two years later with their first independent album ''X'' (2022) to commemorate their tenth anniversary.",
