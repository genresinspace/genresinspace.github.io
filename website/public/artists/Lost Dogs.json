  "description": "'''Lost Dogs''' are an American musical [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in 1991, comprising vocalists, songwriters, and guitarists from multiple [[Christian alternative rock]] bands. Their current lineup includes [[Terry Scott Taylor]] ([[Daniel Amos]], [[The Swirling Eddies]]), [[Michael Roe]] ([[The 77s]]), [[Derri Daugherty]] and [[Steve Hindalong]] ([[The Choir (alternative rock band)|The Choir]]). The original lineup included [[Gene Eugene]] ([[Adam Again]]), who died in 2000. The band's eclectic blending of folk, blues, country, and rock has been characterized as \"a sort of [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] equivalent to the [[Traveling Wilburys]]\". The band released their debut album ''[[Scenic Routes]]'' in 1992 as a one-time collaboration.\n\nLost Dogs concert performances are filled with between-song jokes and one-liners between the band members (usually poking fun at each other). Many Lost Dogs albums include at least one or two cover songs. Songs covered by Lost Dogs on an album or in concert include [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Lord Protect My Child]]\", [[Leonard Cohen]]'s \"If It Be Your Will\", [[The Beatles]]' \"I'm A Loser\", \"[[The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)]]\", and [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"Hard Times, Come Again No More\".\n\nIn March 2000, shortly after the release of their ''Gift Horse'' album, Gene Eugene died.\n\nIn 2004, the band got together with [[Steve Hindalong]] to produce a special album for their summer tour. The result was entitled ''[[Mutt (Lost Dogs album)|Mutt]]'', and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member's regular rock bands. The following year, the band would release the almost entirely instrumental ''[[Island Dreams]]''. ''[[The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees]]'' was released July 2006.\n\nIn 2008, the Lost Dogs traveled down historic [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] with cinematographer [[Jimmy Abegg]]. Abegg filmed the band's experiences. The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey, which was released as [[Old Angel]] in May 2010.",
