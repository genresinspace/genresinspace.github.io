  "description": "'''Negativland''' is an American [[experimental music]] band that originated in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the late 1970s. The core of the band consists of Mark Hosler, David Wills (aka \"The Weatherman\"), Peter Conheim and [[Wobbly (musician)|Jon Leidecker (aka \"Wobbly\")]]. Negativland has released a number of albums ranging from pure sound collage to more musical expositions. These have mostly been released on their own label, [[Seeland Records]].  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they produced several recordings for [[SST Records]], most notably ''[[Escape from Noise]]'', ''[[Helter Stupid]]'' and ''[[U2 (EP)|U2]]''. Negativland were sued by the band [[U2]]'s record label, [[Island Records]], and by [[SST Records]], which brought them widespread publicity and notoriety. The band, along with the [[Church of the SubGenius]] parody religion and other \"creative\" types, were among those given a free website by the University of North Carolina back in 1994 just to see what these creative types would do with a website. Negativland coined the term [[culture jamming]] in 1984. [[Don Joyce (musician)|Don Joyce]] added it to the album ''[[JamCon '84]]'' in the form of \"culture jammer\". The band took their name from a [[Neu!]] track, with their record label [[Seeland Records]] also being named after another Neu! track.",
