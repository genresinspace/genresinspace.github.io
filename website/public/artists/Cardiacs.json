The band's theatrical performance style often incorporated off-putting costumes and make-up, complete with on-stage confrontations. Their sound and image made them unpopular with the press, but they amassed a devoted following.\n\nTim Smith was the primary songwriter, noted for his complex and innovative compositional style. He and his brother were the only constant members in the band's regularly changing [[List of Cardiacs band members#Lineups|lineup]]. The band created their own [[Independent record label|indie label]], the Alphabet Business Concern, in 1984 and found mainstream exposure with the single \"[[Is This the Life?]]\" from their debut album ''[[A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window]]'' (1988). Their second album, ''[[On Land and in the Sea]]'' (1989), was followed by ''[[Heaven Born and Ever Bright]]'' (1992), which displayed a harder edged, [[Heavy metal music|metal]]-leaning sound retained in the subsequent albums ''[[Sing to God]]'' (1996) and ''[[Guns (Cardiacs album)|Guns]]'' (1999). The final Cardiacs album, ''[[LSD (Cardiacs album)|LSD]]'', was left unfinished after Tim Smith was hospitalised with [[dystonia]] resulting from a [[cardiac arrest]] and [[stroke]] in 2008, which caused the band to go on hiatus indefinitely.\n\nSmith's illness brought increased and belated critical recognition to Cardiacs, with several music outlets calling ''Sing to God'' a masterpiece.{{efn|See [[Sing to God#Retrospective assessment]]}} His death in 2020 saw a raft of tributes on social media. Many rock groups including [[Blur (band)|Blur]] were influenced by Cardiacs' eclectic music, which appeared on streaming services in 2021. Alternately billed as \"Cardiacs\", \"The Cardiacs\", and \"Cardiacs Family & Friends\", Cardiacs members \"past, present, and future\" performed the music of Tim Smith at several sold-out gigs in 2024.",
