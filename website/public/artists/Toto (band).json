  "description": "'''Toto''' is an American rock band formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1977. Toto combines elements of [[Pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[hard rock]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]]. Having released 14 studio albums and sold over 50 million records worldwide, the group has received several [[Grammy Award]]s and was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2009.\n\n[[David Paich]] (keyboards, vocals) and [[Jeff Porcaro]] (drums) had played together as [[session musician]]s on several albums and formed the band; [[David Hungate]] (bass), [[Steve Lukather]] (guitar, vocals), [[Steve Porcaro]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Bobby Kimball]] (vocals) were recruited before the release of the band's [[Toto (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1978. Led by the Top 5 single \"[[Hold the Line]]\", the album brought the band to mainstream attention, though it was their fourth album ''[[Toto IV]]'' (1982) which brought them global attention. \"[[Africa (song)|Africa]]\" topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]], while \"[[Rosanna (song)|Rosanna]]\" reached number 2, helping Toto become one of the best-selling music groups of their era.\n\nBefore the release of ''Toto IV'', Hungate left the band. He was replaced on bass by [[Mike Porcaro]] for their 1982 World Tour. During the recording of their next studio album, ''[[Isolation (Toto album)|Isolation]]'', Kimball also departed the band. He was replaced by a number of different short-term vocalists, the first of which was [[Dennis Frederiksen|Fergie Frederiksen]], and the longest serving of which was [[Joseph Williams (musician)|Joseph Williams]]. After Jeff Porcaro's death in 1992, he was replaced by [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]]. While the band has not repeated the U.S. radio successes of their heyday in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they have continued to produce albums and tour more-or-less continuously to the current day, minus a few hiatuses, and have had many more top-ten albums and singles in places like Japan and [[Scandinavia]]. Steve Lukather remains the only original member who still records and tours with the band. Paich remains an official member of the band, though he has mostly retired from touring. Since the 2010s, the band has increasingly relied on contracted touring musicians to continue to perform. As of 2023, they have released fourteen studio albums, eight live albums, one movie soundtrack, 1984's ''[[Dune (1984 soundtrack)|Dune]]'', and a number of compilation albums. Their final release was 2018's ''[[Old Is New]]'' before the band decided against recording any further studio albums. In 2022, Toto launched its \"Dogz of Oz\" Tour by opening for Journey. Its first date was in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on February 22.",
