  "description": "'''Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin'''{{pronunciation needed|date=September 2025}} (born 17 May 1961; [[anglicised]] as ''Enya Patricia Brennan''), known [[mononym]]ously as '''Enya''', is an Irish singer and [[composer]]. With an estimated equivalent of over 80 million albums sold worldwide, Enya is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artist]]s; the 13th best selling female artist of all-time. In addition to being the best-selling Irish solo artist, she is the second-best-selling music act from Ireland overall, after the band [[U2]]. [[Enya discography|Enya's music]] has been widely recognised for its use of multi-layers of her own vocals and instrumentation, lengthened [[Reverberation|reverb]], and interwoven elements of [[Celtic music]].\n\nRaised in the [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking]] region of [[Gweedore]], Enya began her musical career in 1980 playing alongside her family's [[Irish language|Irish]] folk band, [[Clannad]]. She left Clannad in 1982 to pursue a solo career, working with the former Clannad manager and producer, [[Nicky Ryan]], and his wife [[Roma Ryan|Roma]], as their lyricist. Over the following four years, Enya further developed her sound by combining multi-tracked vocals and keyboards with elements from a variety of musical genres, such as [[Celtic music|Celtic]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Gregorian chant]], [[Gregorian chant|church]], [[Jazz music|jazz]], [[hip-hop]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[World music|world]], and [[Irish traditional music|Irish folk]]. Her earliest solo releases were two piano/[[Synthesizer|synthesiser]] instrumentals for the ''Touch Travel'' T4 cassette compilation (1984) composed around 1982–83. The majority of the [[soundtrack]] for ''[[The Frog Prince (1985 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1985) was composed by Enya, and she sang two songs with lyrics for the project. Enya also composed a body of work for a [[Documentary film|documentary]] series by the [[BBC]] named ''[[The Celts (1987 TV series)|The Celts]].'' A selection of Enya's pieces for ''The Celts'' were released as her [[Enya (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1986, with the documentary and [[BBC Records]] releases in 1987.\n\nThe [[chairman]] of Warner Music at the time, [[Rob Dickins]], enjoyed listening to Enya's music for ''The Celts'' and signed her with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]]. The initial record deal granted her considerable [[artistic freedom]] and minimal interference. The success of her second studio album, ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' (1988), propelled Enya to worldwide fame, primarily through her international hit single \"[[Orinoco Flow|Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)]]\". In the following [[decade]] and up to the [[new millennium]], she released the multi-million-selling albums ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' (1991), ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995), and ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' (2000). Sales of ''A Day Without Rain'' and its lead single, \"[[Only Time]]\", surged in the United States following its use in media coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Her subsequent releases included ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'' (2005), ''[[And Winter Came...]]'' (2008) and ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'' (2015).\n\n\"Boadicea\", a track from her eponymous album, appeared in the soundtrack of [[Stephen King]]'s 1992 horror film ''[[Sleepwalkers (1992 film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' and has since been sampled in several hit songs, including \"[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]\" (1996) by [[Fugees]] and \"[[I Don't Wanna Know]]\" (2004) featuring [[Mario Winans]], which became the second Number 1 single featuring Enya, in the UK charts. The song, featuring both the synthesiser and Enya [[humming]] the melody, continues to be sampled almost 4 decades since its initial 1986 release.\n\n[[List of awards and nominations received by Enya|Enya's accolades]] include four [[Grammy Awards]], six [[World Music Awards]], and she holds the record as the most-nominated female Irish artist at the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]], with four nominations. \"[[May It Be]]\", her composition from the soundtrack of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), received a nomination for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Original Song. \n\nIn March 2025, Enya received the [[RTÉ Choice Music Prize]]'s Classic Irish Album award for her 1988 breakthrough album ''Watermark''.",
