  "description": "'''The Animals''', currently billed as '''Eric Burdon & the Animals''' (featuring original frontman [[Eric Burdon]]) and also as '''Animals & Friends''' (featuring original drummer [[John Steel (drummer)|John Steel]]), are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in 1962.\n\nThe Animals' original lineup consisted of frontman [[Eric Burdon]], guitarist [[Hilton Valentine]], bass guitarist [[Chas Chandler]], keyboardist [[Alan Price]], and drummer John Steel. Known for their gritty, [[blues]]y sound, they balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material, and were part of the [[British Invasion]] of the US.\n\nThe Animals rose to prominence with their [[signature song]] and transatlantic number-one hit single \"[[The House of the Rising Sun#The Animals' version|The House of the Rising Sun]]\", and continued this success with hits such as \"[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]\", \"[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]\", \"[[Don't Bring Me Down (The Animals song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\", \"[[I'm Crying]]\", \"[[See See Rider]]\", and \"[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood#The Animals version|Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]\". They underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon then assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] and [[progressive rock]] band with hits such as \"[[San Franciscan Nights]]\", \"[[When I Was Young (song)|When I Was Young]]\", and \"[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]\" before disbanding at the end of the decade. \n\nThe original lineup of Burdon, Price, Chandler, Valentine, and Steel reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names. Altogether, the band has had 10 top-20 hits in both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The Animals' original lineup members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994.",
