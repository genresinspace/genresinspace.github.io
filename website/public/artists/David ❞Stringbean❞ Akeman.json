  "description": "'''David Akeman''' (June 17, 1915 – November 10, 1973), better known as '''Stringbean''' (or '''String Bean'''), was an American singer-songwriter, musician, comedian, and semiprofessional baseball player best known for his role as a main cast member on the hit television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and as a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Akeman was well known for his \"old-fashioned\" [[banjo]]-picking style, careful mix of comedy and music, and his memorable stage wardrobe (which consisted of a long nightshirt tucked into a pair of short blue jeans belted around his knees — giving him the comical appearance of a very tall man with stubby legs). Akeman and his wife were shot and murdered by burglars in their rural Tennessee home near [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], in 1973.",
