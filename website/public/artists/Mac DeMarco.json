  "description": "'''McBriare Samuel Lanyon DeMarco''' (born '''Vernor Winfield McBriare Smith IV'''; April 30, 1990) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer. Mac initially emerged in the indie music scene in 2012, and has since released six full-length studio albums: his debut ''[[2 (Mac DeMarco album)|2]]'' (2012), ''[[Salad Days (Mac DeMarco album)|Salad Days]]'' (2014), ''[[This Old Dog]]'' (2017), ''[[Here Comes the Cowboy]]'' (2019), ''[[Five Easy Hot Dogs]]'' (2023) and ''[[Guitar (Mac DeMarco album)|Guitar]]'' (2025). He additionally released the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]]s ''[[Rock and Roll Night Club]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Another One (Mac DeMarco album)|Another One]]'' in 2015, as well as the [[compilation album]] ''[[One Wayne G]]'' in 2023. In 2018, DeMarco made his own record label by the name of \"Mac's Record Label\".\n\nBefore his commercial debut ''[[Rock and Roll Night Club]]'' in 2012, he made music by the pseudonym \"Makeout Videotape\" on [[Bandcamp]]. Throughout 2009 to 2010 he released albums under this name until in 2011 when he moved from [[Vancouver]] to [[Montreal]], and started working as a solo artist, in which he didn't find any success, so he participated in medical experiments for money. In early 2012 however, Mac eventually signed to indie label [[Captured Tracks]] and released his debut [[extended play]], Rock and Roll Night Club, on vinyl. Earlier, Green Burrito Records released the album on a limited edition 100-unit cassette run.\n\nHis style of music has been described as \"blue wave\" and [[slacker rock]], or, by DeMarco himself, \"jizz jazz\".",
