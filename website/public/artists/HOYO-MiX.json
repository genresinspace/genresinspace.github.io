  "description": "'''HOYO-MiX''' is a [[musical group]] and [[music studio]] under [[miHoYo]], primarily responsible for producing songs and soundtracks for various miHoYo games, including the ''[[Honkai]]'' series, ''[[Tears of Themis]]'', and ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. The studio is headed by Cai Jinhan, miHoYo's music director.\n\nIt was founded after Cai Jinhan and his collaborators had their work using vocaloid songs acquired by miHoYo. Since officially forming in the early 2010s, the studio has produced soundtracks for miHoYo's games, releasing its first OST in 2014. While key figures like composer Chen Yupeng initially shaped the project's musical identity, HOYO-MiX evolved into a flexible team-based system even after Chen's departure. Beyond game music, the studio has collaborated with singers and orchestras worldwide such as the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic]] and [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]]<nowiki/>s. Since 2021, HOYO-MiX has expanded into large-scale live and online concerts worldwide while also engaging in academic and industry initiatives like international digital music festivals. Its music has been received positively, with all but one of the awards it has received coming from its work on ''Genshin Impact''.\n\nAlthough HOYO-MiX consists of several groups of people working on different game projects, they are mostly credited as \"HOYO-MiX\" as a whole in their works on streaming platforms.",
