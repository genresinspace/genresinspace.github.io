  "description": "'''Wayne Shorter''' (August 25, 1933 â€“ March 2, 2023) was an American [[jazz]] saxophonist, composer and bandleader. Shorter came to mainstream prominence in 1959 upon joining [[Art Blakey]]'s [[Jazz Messengers]], for whom he eventually became the primary composer. In 1964 he joined [[Miles Davis]]' [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet|Second Great Quintet]], and then co-founded the [[jazz fusion]] band [[Weather Report]] in 1970. He recorded more than 20 albums as a bandleader.\n\nMany Shorter compositions have become [[jazz standard]]s. His music earned worldwide recognition, critical praise, universal commendation, and 12 [[Grammy Awards]]. He was acclaimed for his mastery of the [[soprano saxophone]] since switching his focus from the [[Tenor saxophone|tenor]] in the late 1960s, and began an extended reign in 1970 as ''[[DownBeat]]''{{'}}s annual poll-winner on that instrument, winning the critics' poll for 10 consecutive years and the readers' for 18. ''[[The New York Times]]'' music critic [[Ben Ratliff]] described Shorter in 2008 as \"probably jazz's greatest living small-group composer and a contender for greatest living [[Musical improvisation|improviser]]\". In 2017, he was awarded the [[Polar Music Prize]].",
