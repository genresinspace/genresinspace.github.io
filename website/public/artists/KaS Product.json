  "description": "'''KaS Product''' are a French electronic duo. Their music has been considered part of the French [[cold wave (music)|cold wave]] and [[electropunk]] movements. Formed in 1980, the duo consisted of Spatsz (Daniel Favre) on electronics and rhythm machines with Mona Soyoc on guitar, vocals and piano. Spatsz worked at a psychiatric hospital previously while Soyoc worked with a jazz band before meeting Spatsz.\n\nTheir music is done in a similar minimal electronics and vocal style akin to ''[[Kaleidoscope (Siouxsie and the Banshees album)|Kaleidoscope]]''-era [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] and [[Soft Cell]]. The press compared Soyoc's voice to that of [[Siouxsie Sioux]].\n\nTheir first and second albums were re-released with bonus tracks. ''[[Try Out (Kas Product album)|Try Out]]'' was re-released with five bonus tracks: \"Mind\", \"Seven\", \"Doctor Insane\", \"In Need\", and \"Malena\". ''By Pass'' was re-released with four bonus tracks: \"Scape\", \"Sweet & Sour\", \"Crash\" and \"Party\". All of the tracks on both CDs have been remastered.\n\n{{cquote|Gorgeously provocative duo of Mona Soyoc and Spatz who released a couple of singles on their own punk label, then signed to RCA which seemed a remarkably odd union, which produced two blindingly brilliant albums, 'Try Out' and 'Bypass' that found the haunting, mad vocals hemmed in by and stretched out over the alternately boiling/icy keyboards, the shattering chatter of arching/dive bombing guitar and stabbing electronic rhythms. - Mick Mercer<ref>Mick Mercer, ''Gothic Rock'', Los Angeles: Cleopatra Records, p. 112.</ref>}}\n\nOn 1 February 2019, it was announced that Spatsz had died. He was 61 years old.\n\nPer videos on YouTube with a 2022 copyright, now KaS Product Reload with Thomas Bouetel (machines) and \nPierre Corneau (Basse) joining Mona. Their Facebook activity is current as of September, 2024, and they have several live videos on their Youtube channel from 2024 concerts in France.\n\nA new album, Reloaded, is due to be released at the end of March 2025.",
