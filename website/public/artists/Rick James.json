  "description": "'''James Ambrose Johnson Jr.''' (February 1, 1948 â€“ August 6, 2004), better known by his stage name '''Rick James''', was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born and raised in [[Buffalo, New York]], James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] to avoid [[conscription|being drafted]] into the Army. In 1964, James moved to [[Toronto]], Canada, where he formed the rock band [[The Mynah Birds]], who eventually signed a recording deal with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 1966. James's career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail. After being released, James moved to [[California]], where he started a variety of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[funk]] groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAfter forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's [[Gordy Records]], releasing the album ''[[Come Get It!]]'' in 1978 which produced the hits \"[[You and I (Rick James song)|You & I]]\" and \"[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]\". In 1981, James released his most successful album, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which included career-defining hits such as \"[[Give It to Me Baby]]\" and \"[[Super Freak]]\", the latter song becoming his biggest [[Crossover music|crossover single]], mixing elements of funk, disco, rock, and [[new wave music|new wave]]. James was also known for his [[soul music|soulful]] ballads such as \"Fire & Desire\" and \"[[Ebony Eyes (Rick James song)|Ebony Eyes]]\". He also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists, including [[Teena Marie]], the [[Mary Jane Girls]], [[The Temptations]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and [[Smokey Robinson]].\n\nJames's mainstream success peaked by the release of his album ''[[Glow (Rick James album)|Glow]]'' in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, ''[[The A-Team]]''. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper [[MC Hammer]] sampled James's \"Super Freak\" for his breakout 1990 hit, \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\", which won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]]. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James's career was hampered by his drug addiction, and he was embroiled in legal issues. In 1993, he was convicted of two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of [[crack cocaine]], resulting in a three-year sentence at [[Folsom State Prison]]. He was released on parole in 1996. His health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.\n\nIn 2004, James's career returned to mainstream [[Popular culture|pop culture]] after he appeared in an episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The segment involved a [[Charlie Murphy (actor)|Charlie Murphy]] ''[[E! True Hollywood Story|True Hollywood Stories]]''-style sketch that satirized James's wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music, and that year he returned to perform on the road. He died later that year from heart failure at age 56.",
