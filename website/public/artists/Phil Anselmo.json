  "name": "Phil Anselmo",
  "description": "'''Philip Hansen Anselmo''' (born June 30, 1968) is an American musician best known as the lead singer for [[groove metal]] band [[Pantera]], [[southern metal]] supergroup [[Down (band)|Down]], and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] band [[Superjoint]], amongst other musical projects. He is the owner of [[Housecore Records]].\n\nAnselmo is regarded as one of the most iconic frontmen in metal history, known for being particularly animated and donning a machismo attitude that became emblematic of the general theme of Pantera. Earlier in his career with the band, Anselmo took considerable inspiration from traditional heavy metal vocalists such as [[Rob Halford]], singing in full [[head voice]]. However, he later became recognized for a more abrasive style of vocals, and formed a number of extreme metal projects such as [[Scour (band)|Scour]].",
