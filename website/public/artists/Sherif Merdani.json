His artistic career was abruptly halted by the communist regime, following the aftermath of the [[Festivali i Këngës 11|11th edition]] of [[Festivali i Këngës]], which led to his arrest and imprisonment. After the fall of communism and his release from the notorious Qafë-Bari Prison, where he spent part of his 16 years, Merdani returned to public life and served in Albania's diplomatic service.",
