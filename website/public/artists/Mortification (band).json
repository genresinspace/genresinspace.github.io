  "description": "'''Mortification''' was an Australian [[Christian death metal]] band which was formed in 1987 as a heavy metal group, '''Lightforce''', by mainstay [[Steve Rowe]] on bass guitar and vocals. By 1990, in the Melbourne suburb of [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], they were renamed as Mortification with the line-up of Rowe, Michael Carlisle on guitar and Jayson Sherlock on drums. Mortification has released fourteen studio albums, three compilation albums, three extended plays, six live discs, one demo album, one box set, and several videos on major record labels such as [[Nuclear Blast]]. As one of the earliest internationally successful Christian death metal bands from Australia, they served as an inspiration for later similar groups.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Mortification played death and [[thrash metal]]. After the departure of Sherlock, Mortification began experimenting with [[groove metal]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[power metal]]. They achieved commercial success with ''[[Blood World]]'' in 1994 and received critical acclaim for 1996's ''[[EnVision EvAngelene]]''. Despite the lack of subsequent commercial success or mainstream critical recognition, \"the band, in spite of their extreme sound, are some kind of superstars in the 'White Metal' scene\", and have been described as \"a legend in the death metal scene.\"\n\nIn late 1996, Rowe was diagnosed with [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia|acute lymphatic leukemia]] and took 18 months to recover.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} Mortification issued their tenth album, ''[[Triumph of Mercy]]'' in August 1998 and accompanied it with a tour of North America. By August 1999, the band had sold a total of a quarter of a million albums across Europe and the US. They returned to their death/thrash roots for the 2004 album, ''[[Brain Cleaner]]''.",
