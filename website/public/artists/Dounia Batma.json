  "description": "'''Dounia Batma''' ({{langx|ar|دنيا بطمة}}) (born 1 April 1991) is a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] singer and actress who rose to popularity around the world as the runner-up of the [[Arab Idol (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Arab Idol]]'' (the Arabic version of [[Pop Idol]]) on [[Middle East Broadcasting Center|MBC]]. She lost the title against Egyptian contestant [[Carmen Suleiman]]. She married Mohamed Al Turk, the father of Bahraini singer [[Hala Al Turk]].\n\nBatma was born and raised in [[Hay Mohammadi]], in the [[Ain Sebaa-Hay Mohammedi]] district of [[Casablanca]], Morocco. Her father, Hamid Batma, played for different bands including Mesnawa and Nass El Ghiwane, and her uncle, [[Laarbi Batma]], is the leader of Moroccan fusion group [[Nass El Ghiwane]], considered by [[Martin Scorsese]] as \"Africa's Rolling Stones\". She studied tourism after high-school, without stopping to dream about a musical career. In 2010, at the age of 18, inspired by her already-famous older cousin Khansa Batma (Mohamed Batma's daughter), she took part in a Moroccan musical competition, called [[Studio 2M]], broadcast on [[2M TV]], in the Oriental category. She sang various songs of both [[Moroccan music|Moroccan]] and [[Arabic music|Middle-Eastern]] repertoires, and reached the semi-finals. She did not reach the final, but managed to release a single \"Aalash Tgheeb\" (Why are you hiding?) in [[Moroccan Arabic]] which didn't become very successful. But she realized that she would need to go further to get the career she was expecting and Arab Idol was a great venue to reach the Arab World's heart.",
