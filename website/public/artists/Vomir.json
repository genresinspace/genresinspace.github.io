  "description": "'''Romain Perrot''' (born 1973), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Vomir''' ('vomit' or 'regurgitate'), is a French [[noise music]] artist based in [[Paris]]. Since beginning his career in 1996, Vomir has appeared in over 300 releases, including singles, albums and collaborations with other [[noise music|noise]] artists. The majority of his albums were produced by his own independent label, Decimation Sociale. Vomir positions his approach to music as an \"anti-\" approach, with a radical and [[nihilism|nihilist]] stance. He spearheads the [[harsh noise wall]] movement, an extreme subgenre of noise music which he describes as \"no ideas, no change, no development, no entertainment, no remorse\".\n\nAt a young age Perrot was heavily influenced by [[Pink Floyd]] and taught himself how to perform music in his childhood. In the 1990s, he moved closer to the experimental scene by frequenting artists Bimbo Tower, U-Bahn and Instants Chavirés, but it was through the discovery of [[Japanoise]] from [[Merzbow]] and [[Keiji Haino]] that he was introduced to the [[free improvisation]] and [[harsh noise]] genres. He became fond of [[The Rita]] and his self-titled genre \"militant walls\", which led him to term the genre harsh noise wall, which he began to produce under the stage name Vomir in 2006.\n\nVomir is the founder and head organiser of Harsh Noise Wall Festival, organised at Les Instants Chavirés, [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis]]. He has collaborated with Marc Hurtado, Rotted Brain, Écoute la Merde, [[Werewolf Jerusalem]], [[Government Alpha]] and Torturing Nurse among several others.",
