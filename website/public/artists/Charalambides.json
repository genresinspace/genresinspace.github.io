  "description": "'''Charalambides''' is an [[avant-garde music]]al group originally from [[Houston]], [[Texas]], United States and lately of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas. They were formed in 1991 under the short-lived name Mutual Admiration Society by Tom Carter, Christina Carter and Kyle Silfer, and later members have since included Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray. The band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. Their music contains elements typical of [[psychedelic music]] such as reverb, [[Reverse tape effects|backwards recording]], extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds, which led to them being described as part of the [[New Weird America]] movement. In addition to several major releases on labels such as [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]], Eclipse Records, and [[Time-Lag Records]], they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (''Our Bed is Green'', and ''Historic Sixth Ward'' for example).\n\nTheir name derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter met, who are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition, the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as [[Loren Mazzacane Connors]], [[Yellow Swans]] and Robert Horton.",
