  "description": "'''Robyn Rowan Hitchcock''' (born 3 March 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano, and bass guitar. After leading [[the Soft Boys]] in the late 1970s and releasing the influential ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'' with them in June 1980, Hitchcock launched a prolific solo career.\n\nHitchcock's earliest lyrics mined a rich vein of English surrealist comic tradition and tended to depict a particular type of eccentric and sardonic English worldview. His music and performance style was influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], and by the [[English folk music]] revival of the 1960s and early 1970s. This was soon filtered through a then-unfashionable [[psychedelic rock]] lens during the [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]] eras of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This combination of musical styles won Hitchcock's band of the time, The Soft Boys, an enthusiastic if small fanbase. However, the Soft Boys' final album together, ''Underwater Moonlight'', posthumously earned them a glowing reputation (particularly in America) as a major influence on bands like [[R.E.M.]]\n\nAfter finding a measure of success in the latter 1980s in America, Hitchcock's lyrical and musical horizons broadened further to encompass a range of approaches while still retaining a recognisably surreal, but more serious, signature style. He has recorded for two major American labels ([[A&M Records]], then [[Warner Bros.]]) over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, and was the subject of a live performance/documentary film (''[[Storefront Hitchcock (film)|Storefront Hitchcock]]'') by major motion picture director [[Jonathan Demme]] in 1998. Since the turn of the millennium he has also finally received belated critical recognition in his home country. Despite this, mainstream success remains limited. He continues to tour and record prolifically and has earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances, and a dedicated \"cult following\" for his unique body of work.",
