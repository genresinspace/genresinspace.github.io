He first recorded in 1962, recording his own songs and singing in Spanish. He signed to Caracol and released his first single, ''Balada de la tristeza'', which became a hit in the summer of 1963. The following year he signed with Arena and released his most well-known songs, ''Cielo'' (as a way to say \"Honey\", a cover of the Bobby Hebb song ''[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]''), ''Despídete con un beso'' (\"Say goodbye with a kiss\") and ''Si me vas a abandonar'' (\"If you are going to leave me\"). His 1969 live album, ''[[Buddy Richard en el Astor]]'', was broadcast live on Chilean television and radio, one of the first live broadcasts in the country. His 1975 song ''Tu cariño se me va'' (\"Your love leaves me\") and his 1982 song ''Mentira'' (\"Lie\") (made popular by the [[Nicaragua]]n singer [[Hernaldo Zúñiga]]) became popular across Latin America. After a lull in his career, he again became popular in 1993 after recording with the band [[Los Tres]].\n\nHe retired from public performance in 2008, playing his last concert at the [[Quinta Vergara]] on 25 February at the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival]].
