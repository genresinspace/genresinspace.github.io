  "description": "'''Jason Forrest''' is an American [[electronic music]] producer known for noisy [[Experimental music|experimental]] [[electronica]] and [[breakcore]] incorporating many ideas of [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] and [[rock and roll]]. Largely produced and performed on a single computer (including live shows), his songs tend to be constructed from digital samples of found sounds and other artists' music. Until 2004 he recorded under the name '''Donna Summer''', an allusion to [[disco]] singer [[Donna Summer]].\n\nIn 2005 ''[[RES (magazine)|RES]]'' magazine named Forrest's \"Steppin Off\" video, by director Jon Watts, music video of the year. In 2006 ''Res'' magazine named Forrest's video ''War Photographer'', directed by [[Joel Trussell]] video of the year, and online magazine ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' also named it in their top five videos of the year. Both videos have won several awards at various international film and video festivals and have both been widely viewed, downloaded and acclaimed.\n\nForrest has released on many labels, but primarily on [[Sonig]], the KÃ¶ln, Germany based record label. He also has releases on Irritant Records (UK), Omeko (JP), MeWe le Disque (BE), Mirex (DE), Brooklyn Beats (USA), and [[HOSS Records]] (USA).\n\nSome of the more conspicuous samples of other artists to be found in Forrest's work include ones from [[Laurie Anderson]], [[The Who]], Supertramp, Steely Dan, Joe Jackson, Elton John, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pat Benatar. This (along with his former stage name) shows his interest in appropriation as an artistic concept. Along with many images featured on the Cock Rock Disco web site it also shows his interest in recontextualizing popular culture from past decades.\n\nForrest grew up in South Carolina, has lived in [[Atlanta]] and New York City and now (Winter, 2009) resides in Berlin. He has a BA in Photography. He previously worked as a professional artist as well as an art critic for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution news paper.\n\nBesides being a fan himself, there is no connection between Forrest and the [[pop music]]/[[disco]] artist, [[Donna Summer]]. In a 2003 interview with the [[CBC Radio]] program, ''[[Brave New Waves]]'', he stated that by being a [[middle class]] white male using this name he was \"subjecting people to a fake issue of diversity\" and forcing them \"to consider gender a little bit more\".",
