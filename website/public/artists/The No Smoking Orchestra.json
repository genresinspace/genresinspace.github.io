  "description": "'''The No Smoking Orchestra''', frequently credited as '''Emir Kusturica and the No Smoking Orchestra''', was a Serbian [[garage rock]] band formed in [[Belgrade]] in 1993.\n\nThe band was formed in 1993 by [[Nele Karajlić]] who, after relocating to Belgrade from [[Sarajevo]], decided to revive [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], a band he co-founded with [[Sejo Sexon]] in 1980 that had at that point been dormant since 1990. Initially, the band performed as Zabranjeno Pušenje, but ultimately changed the name to Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra when renowned filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]] (who had previously played with the band in 1987) re-joined it in 1998.",
