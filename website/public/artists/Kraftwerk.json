  "description": "'''Kraftwerk''' ({{IPA|de|ˈkʁaftvɛʁk|-|de-Kraftwerk.ogg}}, {{literally|[[power plant]]}}) is a German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band formed in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1970 by [[Ralf Hütter]] and [[Florian Schneider]]. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of [[electronic music]], Kraftwerk was among the first successful acts to popularise the genre. The group began as part of [[West Germany]]'s experimental [[krautrock]] scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, [[drum machine]]s, and [[vocoder]]s. [[Wolfgang Flür]] joined the band in 1973 and [[Karl Bartos]] in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.\n\nOn commercially successful albums such as ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' (1974), ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (1977), ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (1978), and ''[[Computer World]]'' (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described \"robot pop\" style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylised image including matching suits. Following the release of ''[[Electric Café]]'' (1986), Flür left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. The band released ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks]]'', its most recent studio and concept album, in 2003. Founding member Florian Schneider left in 2008 to pursue solo work until his death in 2020. The band, with new members, has continued to tour under the leadership of Ralf Hütter.\n\nThe band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-punk]], [[techno]], [[house music]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], and [[club music]]. In 2014, [[the Recording Academy]] honoured Kraftwerk with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. It later won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album]] with its live album ''[[3-D The Catalogue]]'' (2017) at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018 ceremony]]. In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the [[Rock & Roll Hall of Fame]] in the early influence category. As of 2026, the band continues to [[Tour (music)|tour]], with the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary.",
