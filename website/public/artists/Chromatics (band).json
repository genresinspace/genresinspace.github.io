  "description": "'''Chromatics''' were an American [[electronic music]] band from [[Portland, Oregon]], formed in 2001. The band's final line-up consisted of [[Ruth Radelet]] (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar, vocoder), Nat Walker (drums, synthesizer), and [[Johnny Jewel]] (producer, multi-instrumentalist). The band originally featured a trademark sound indebted to [[punk rock|punk]] and [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] that was described as \"noisy\" and \"chaotic\". After numerous lineup changes, which left [[guitarist]] Adam Miller as the sole original member, the band began releasing material on the [[Italians Do It Better]] record label in 2007, with their style streamlined into an [[Italo disco]]-influenced sound.\n\nTheir third album ''[[Night Drive (album)|Night Drive]]'' (2007) was met with critical acclaim, as was their fourth album, ''[[Kill for Love]]'', which was released on March 26, 2012. Several of the band's songs have been featured in television series such as ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', ''[[Mr. Robot]]'', ''[[The Mindy Project]]'', ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]'', ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'', ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'', ''[[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]]'', ''[[Baby (Italian TV series)|Baby]]'', and ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks]]'', as well as being featured in the films ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011), ''[[Taken 2]]'' (2012), ''[[Only You (2018 film)|Only You]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Perfection]]'' (2019). In December 2014, the band announced what would have been their fifth studio album, titled ''[[Dear Tommy]]''. While Chromatics have released a number of singles from it, ''Dear Tommy'' had yet to be released when they instead issued the album ''[[Closer to Grey]]'' in October 2019. The band announced its break-up in August 2021.",
