  "description": "'''Bernard''' \"'''Buddy'''\" '''Rich''' (September 30, 1917 â€“ April 2, 1987) was an American [[jazz]] drummer, songwriter, conductor, and bandleader. He is considered one of the most influential drummers of all time.\n\nRich was born and raised in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], United States. He discovered his affinity for jazz music at a young age and began drumming at the age of two. He began playing jazz in 1937, working with acts such as [[Bunny Berigan]], [[Artie Shaw]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Count Basie]], and [[Harry James]]. From 1942 to 1944, Rich served in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]. From 1945 to 1948, he led the '''Buddy Rich Orchestra'''. In 1966, he recorded a big-band style arrangement of songs from ''[[West Side Story]]''. He found lasting success in 1966{{citation needed|date=February 2021|reason=Swingin' New Big Band and The Sounds of '66 were released in 1966, so it appears that the band was formed in 1966 rather than 1967. The Wikipedia and AllMusic articles about the 1967 album Big Swing Face say it was the second album by the Buddy Rich Big Band, not the first.}} with the formation of the '''Buddy Rich Big Band''', also billed as the '''Buddy Rich Band''' and '''The Big Band Machine'''.\n\nRich was known for his virtuoso technique, power, and speed. He was an advocate of the [[traditional grip]], though he occasionally used [[matched grip]] when playing the [[Tom-tom drum|toms]]. Despite his commercial success and musical talent, Rich never learned how to read [[sheet music]], preferring to listen to the drum parts played in rehearsal by whoever was his drum roadie at the time and relying on his excellent memory.",
