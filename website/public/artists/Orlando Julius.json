He began experimenting with combining traditional music with horns, guitar, and American genres, a fusion which came to be known as afrobeat. He had his first hits with 1965's \"Jagua Nana\" and the 1966 album ''Super Afro Soul''. In the 1970s, Julius moved to the United States, forming a band with [[Hugh Masekela]] and later working as a [[session musician]] before returning to Nigeria in 1984. A series of [[reissue]]s in the 2000s and 2010s led to international touring and a collaboration with [[The Heliocentrics]] which reached the [[Billboard World Albums]] chart.",
