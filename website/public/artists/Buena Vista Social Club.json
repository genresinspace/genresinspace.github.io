  "description": "'''Buena Vista Social Club''' was a [[musical ensemble]] primarily made up of Cuban musicians, formed in 1996. The project was organized by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]] executive [[Nick Gold]], produced by American guitarist [[Ry Cooder]] and directed by [[Juan de Marcos González]]. They named the group after the [[Social club|members' club]] of the same name in the [[Buenavista, Havana|Buenavista]] quarter of [[Havana]], a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as [[son cubano|son]], [[bolero]] and [[danzón]], they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, some of whom had been retired for many years.\n\nThe group's [[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|eponymous studio album]] was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in [[Amsterdam]] and [[New York City|New York]] in 1998. German director [[Wim Wenders]] captured the performance on film for a [[Documentary film|documentary]]—also called ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]''—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary feature]] and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the [[European Film Awards]]. This was followed up by a second documentary ''[[Buena Vista Social Club: Adios]]'' in 2017.\n\nThe success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and [[Latin American music]] in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The \"Buena Vista Social Club\" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's \"musical golden age\" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: [[Compay Segundo]], [[Rubén González (pianist)|Rubén González]], and [[Ibrahim Ferrer]], who died aged 95, 84, and 78 respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.\n\nSeveral surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero [[Eliades Ochoa]], veteran singer [[Omara Portuondo]], and [[laúd]] player [[Barbarito Torres]] currently tour worldwide.{{Update inline|date=February 2025|reason=Statement with “currently” ([[MOS:CURRENT]]) supported by an archived page from 2005}}.
