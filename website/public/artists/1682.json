  "description": "'''Irving Jones''' (1873 â€“ March 9, 1932) was an American comedian and songwriter who specialized in a [[ragtime]] musical genre known as [[coon song]]s during their heyday in the late 19th and early 20th century.  He sold close to 50 songs, many of which became enormously popular. A successful comic throughout his career, he has been hailed as a pioneer of ragtime music and both praised and criticized for his ability to take advantage of the popularity of the coon song genre, which often used stereotypical portrayals of African-Americans.",
