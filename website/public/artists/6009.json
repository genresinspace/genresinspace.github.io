  "description": "'''Blood for Blood''' is an American [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. It was formed in 1994 by Erick \"Buddha\" Medina and \"White Trash\" Rob Lind, drawing inspiration from the hardcore scene in Boston and New York. In 1997, they were signed to [[Victory Records]]. The band describes its sound as influenced by [[Sheer Terror]], [[Breakdown (band)|Breakdown]], [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]] and [[Killing Time (American band)|Killing Time]].\n\nAfter their 2004 album was released, the band went on hiatus until 2010. Guitarist and songwriter Rob Lind decided touring with the band would be detrimental to his newfound sobriety, having been a [[heroin]] addict and alcoholic for many years, and feared a relapse. As a tour replacement, the band called upon [[Billy Graziadei]] from [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] to fill in on guitar duties in Lind's absence.\n\nIn 2011, the band mentioned Lind's possible return for another full-length album; however, in June 2012, vocalist Erick Medina was kicked out of the band due to being charged with raping a minor. The band has since been resurrected with Lind on vocals.",
