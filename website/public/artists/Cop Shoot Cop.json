  "description": "'''Cop Shoot Cop''' was a [[noise rock]] group founded in New York City in 1987. They disbanded in 1996. The band were frequently classified as [[industrial rock]], but were often quite different from many bands so dubbed: having a distinctive instrumental lineup that encompassed twin bass guitars, found metal percussion, and no lead guitar. The group had little mainstream success (scoring a few hits on [[college radio]]), despite tours with [[Iggy Pop]] and music videos on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' and ''[[120 Minutes]]'' (notably for \"$10 Bill\", featuring a number of [[dwarfism|little people]]). They retain a [[cult following]]â€”their out-of-print releases sometimes sell for large amounts.",
