  "description": "'''Magazine''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1977 in [[Manchester, England]] by singer [[Howard Devoto]] and guitarist [[John McGeoch]]. After leaving the [[punk rock]] group [[Buzzcocks]] in early 1977, Devoto decided to create a more progressive and less \"traditional\" rock band. The original lineup of Magazine was composed of Devoto, McGeoch, [[Barry Adamson]] on bass, Bob Dickinson on keyboards and [[Martin Jackson]] on drums.\n\nTheir debut album, ''[[Real Life (Magazine album)|Real Life]]'' (1978), was critically acclaimed and later considered one of the first British [[post-punk]] albums. After releasing two other albums, ''[[Secondhand Daylight]]'' and ''[[The Correct Use of Soap]]'', McGeoch left the band in 1980 to join [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]. Magazine released another studio album and disbanded in 1981. All four of their albums reached the top 40 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\nThey reunited in 2009 for a UK tour with [[Noko]] on guitar. Magazine released an album of new material, ''[[No Thyself]]'', in October 2011, followed by a short UK tour.\n\nMagazine have been cited as an influence by bands and musicians such as [[Simple Minds]], [[the Smiths]], [[Radiohead]], [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and [[John Frusciante]].",
