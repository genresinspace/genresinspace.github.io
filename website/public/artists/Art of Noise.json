  "description": "'''Art of Noise''' (also '''the Art of Noise''') were a British [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] [[synth-rock]] group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer [[Gary Langan]] and programmer [[J. J. Jeczalik]], along with keyboardist/arranger [[Anne Dudley]], producer [[Trevor Horn]], and music journalist [[Paul Morley]]. The group had international Top 20 hits with its interpretations of \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\", featuring [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and the instrumental \"[[Peter Gunn (song)|Peter Gunn]]\", which won a 1986 [[Grammy Award]].\n\nThe group's mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic [[sound collage]]s based on digital [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of [[electronics]] and computers in pop music, particularly its innovative use of [[sample (music)|sampling]].",
