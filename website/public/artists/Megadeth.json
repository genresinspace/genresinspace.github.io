  "description": "'''Megadeth''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist and guitarist [[Dave Mustaine]]. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the \"big four\" of American thrash metal—along with [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[Metallica]]—and is credited with helping to develop and popularize the genre. Their music features intricate arrangements, fast [[rhythm section]]s, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes such as war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.\n\nIn 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, ''[[Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!]]'', on the independent record label [[Combat Records]], to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with [[Capitol Records]]. Their first major-label album, ''[[Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?]]'', was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' [[substance abuse]] issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of [[Music recording sales certification|platinum-selling albums]], including ''[[So Far, So Good... So What!]]'' (1988), ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' (1990) and ''[[Countdown to Extinction]]'' (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. Megadeth's most recent album, ''[[The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!]]'', was released in 2022.\n\nMegadeth has undergone multiple lineup changes throughout its {{Age|1983|4|1}}-year career, with Mustaine being the sole consistent member of the band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist [[David Ellefson]], who had [[Ellefson v. Megadeth, Inc.|taken legal action]] against Mustaine. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth's current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist [[James LoMenzo]], guitarist [[Teemu Mäntysaari]] and drummer [[Dirk Verbeuren]].\n\nMegadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums, and [[List of awards and nominations received by Megadeth|has received twelve Grammy nominations]]. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in [[59th Annual Grammy Awards|2017]] for the song \"[[Dystopia (song)|Dystopia]]\" in the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] category. The band's mascot, [[Vic Rattlehead]], regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, [[Gigantour]], several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in October 2019. {{As of|2023}}, the band sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.",
