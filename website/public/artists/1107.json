Their best-known line-up consisted of lead vocalist [[Brian Connolly]], bassist [[Steve Priest]], guitarist [[Andy Scott (guitarist)|Andy Scott]] and drummer [[Mick Tucker]].\n\nThe band formed in London in 1968, originally with the name the Sweetshop, and achieved their first hit, \"[[Funny, Funny]]\", in 1971, after teaming up with songwriters [[Nicky Chinn]] and [[Mike Chapman]] and record producer [[Phil Wainman]]. During 1971 and 1972, their musical style showed a marked progression, from [[the Archies]]-like [[bubblegum pop|bubblegum]] style of \"Funny, Funny\" to a [[The Who|Who]]-influenced hard rock style, supplemented by a use of high-pitched backing vocals.\n\nThe band achieved success in the UK charts during the 1970s, having thirteen top 20 hits, with \"[[Block Buster!]]\" (1973) topping the chart, followed by three consecutive number-two hits: \"Hell Raiser\" (1973), \"[[The Ballroom Blitz]]\" (1973) and \"[[Teenage Rampage]]\" (1974). The band turned to a more [[hard rock]] style with their mid-career singles, such as 1974's \"[[Turn It Down (Sweet song)|Turn It Down]]\". \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\" (1975) also reached number two on the UK chart. The band were popular in West Germany and other countries on the European mainland.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}} The group achieved success in the US with the top ten hits \"[[Little Willy (song)|Little Willy]]\", \"The Ballroom Blitz\", \"Fox on the Run\", and \"[[Love Is Like Oxygen]]\".\n\nSweet had their last international success in 1978 with \"Love Is Like Oxygen\". Connolly left the group in 1979 to start a solo career, and the remaining members continued as a trio until they disbanded in 1981. From the mid-1980s, Scott, Connolly and Priest each played with their own versions of Sweet at different times. Connolly died in 1997, Tucker in 2002 and Priest in 2020. Andy Scott is still active with his version of the band. Sweet have sold over 35 million albums worldwide.",
