  "description": "'''Henry Mobley''' (July 7, 1930 &ndash; May 30, 1986) was an American tenor saxophonist and composer. Mobley was described by [[Leonard Feather]] as the \"middleweight champion of the tenor saxophone\", a metaphor used to describe his tone, that was neither as aggressive as [[John Coltrane]] nor as mellow as [[Lester Young]], and his style that was laid-back, subtle and melodic, especially in contrast with players such as Coltrane and [[Sonny Rollins]]. The critic Stacia Proefrock claimed him \"one of the most underrated musicians of the bop era.\" Mobley's compositions include \"Double Exposure\", \"Soul Station\", and \"Dig Dis\".",
