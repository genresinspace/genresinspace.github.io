  "description": "'''The Dismemberment Plan''' is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Washington, D.C.]] on January 1, 1993. Also known as '''D-Plan''' or '''the Plan''', the name was derived from an industry phrase used by insurance salesman Ned Ryerson in the 1993 comedy film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''. The band members include Eric Axelson ([[bass guitar|bass]]), Jason Caddell ([[guitar]]), Joe Easley ([[Drum kit|drums]]), and [[Travis Morrison]] ([[Singing|vocals]] and [[guitar]]). Axelson, Caddell, Morrison and original drummer Steve Cummings formed the band in college, knowing each other from attending northern Virginia high schools (Axelson, Cummings, and Morrison attended [[Lake Braddock Secondary School]] in [[Burke, Virginia]]). Cummings left the band after the recording of their debut album ''[[! (The Dismemberment Plan album)|!]]'' and was replaced by Easley, cementing the band's lineup.\n\nThe Dismemberment Plan released four albums before breaking up in 2003, the best known being 1999's critically acclaimed ''[[Emergency & I]]''. They reunited three times after their initial disbandment for additional tour dates, and to produce their fifth studio album ''[[Uncanney Valley]]'' in 2013.",
