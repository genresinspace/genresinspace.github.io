  "description": "'''Faheem Rashad Najm''' (born September 30, 1984), known professionally as '''T-Pain''', is an American singer and rapper. He is known for popularizing creative use of [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]], often used with extreme parameter settings to create [[electronic music|electronic]]-styled vocal performances. Blending its use with [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[hip-hop]] sensibilities, T-Pain became a prominent figure in both genres throughout the 2000s. Other music industry artists, such as [[Lil Wayne]], [[Kanye West]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], and [[Travis Scott]], have since utilized Auto-Tune to a similar effect. \n\nT-Pain began his recording career as part of the hip-hop group Nappy Headz. He released his debut solo mixtape, ''Back @ It'' independently in 2004, and signed with [[Akon]]'s [[Konvict Muzik]], in a joint venture with [[Jive Records]], the following year. His 2005 debut single, \"[[I'm Sprung]]\", was quickly met with commercial success, peaking at number eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and receiving [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Its follow-up, \"[[I'm 'n Luv (wit a Stripper)]]\" (featuring [[Mike Jones (rapper)|Mike Jones]]), peaked at number five on the chart; both served as lead singles for his debut studio album, ''[[Rappa Ternt Sanga]]'' (2005). Despite moderate critical and commercial reception, his second album, ''[[Epiphany (T-Pain album)|Epiphany]]'' (2007), peaked atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the ''Billboard'' Hot 100-number one single \"[[Buy U a Drank (Shawty Snappin')]]\" (featuring [[Yung Joc]]), as well as the top-40 single, \"[[Bartender (T-Pain song)|Bartender]]\" (featuring Akon). His third album, ''[[Three Ringz]]'' (2008), was preceded by the single \"[[Can't Believe It (T-Pain song)|Can't Believe It]]\" (featuring Lil Wayne), and his fourth album, ''[[Revolver (T-Pain album)|Revolver]]'' (2011), was preceded by \"[[5 O'Clock (T-Pain song)|5 O'Clock]]\" (featuring [[Wiz Khalifa]] and [[Lily Allen]]). His fifth album, ''[[Oblivion (T-Pain album)|Oblivion]]'' (2017) sustained long-term delays and was met with critical and commercial failure, serving as his final release on a [[Record label #Major labels|major label]]. \n\nMeanwhile, T-Pain saw continued success as a guest performer on nine Hot 100-top ten singles—\"[[Shawty (Plies song)|Shawty]]\" by [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]], \"[[Cyclone (song)|Cyclone]]\" by [[Baby Bash]], \"[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]\" by Kanye West, \"[[Shawty Get Loose]]\" by [[Lil Mama]], \"[[Got Money]]\" by Lil Wayne, \"[[Blame It]]\" by [[Jamie Foxx]], and \"[[Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)]]\" by [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]—which includes two singles that peaked the chart: \"[[Kiss Kiss (Chris Brown song)|Kiss Kiss]]\" by [[Chris Brown]] and \"[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]\" by [[Flo Rida]]. The latter was named third in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Songs of the Decade and received [[List of music recording certifications#Digital download singles|diamond (10× platinum)]] certification by the RIAA. \"Good Life\" and \"Blame It\" both won [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]], respectively, from T-Pain's total of 12 nominations for the award. Outside of music, he founded the record label [[Nappy Boy Entertainment]] in 2005, which has signed fellow rapper [[Travie McCoy]]. Furthermore, he has produced and written material for other artists, and [[voice acting|voice acted]] in film and television including ''[[Tom & Jerry (2021 American film)|Tom & Jerry]]'', ''[[Freaknik: The Musical]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', and ''[[We Bare Bears]]''.",
