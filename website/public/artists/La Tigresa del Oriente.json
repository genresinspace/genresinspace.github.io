  "description": "'''Juana Judith Bustos Ahuite''' (born 22 November 1945) is best known as '''La Tigresa del Oriente''' ({{Literal translation|The Eastern Tigress}}, the \"east\" being the [[Peruvian Amazon]]) is a Peruvian singer, hairdresser, actress, [[makeup artist]] and model. Due to the popularity of her videos on YouTube (the video for her single \"''[[Nuevo Amanecer]]''\" surpassed the 10-million-hit mark in 2009), she has become an [[internet meme]] and reached some international fame.\n\nLa Tigresa is known for her [[leopard]] garb, makeup and appearance, and for the [[choreographies]] staged by her dancing troupe, which includes three women and one man. Her first single \"''Nuevo amanecer'' (New Dawn)\" became an Internet meme in Latin America.\n\nHer videos for her first recording are unique, if low in budget, and were filmed in the Peruvian jungle with her \"exotic\" dancers.  Other singles from Bustos include: \"''Mi canoa''\", \"''Carnaval en Iquitos''\", \"''Trabaja flojo trabaja\"'', \"''Anaconda''\", \"''Tr√°nsfuga de mi amor''\", \"''Hombre de Madera''\", and \"''Homenaje al Papa Juan Pablo II''.\"\n\nIn 2011, she released her second record label plate ''Fiesta Felina'', and later that same year took the English version of \"Nuevo amanecer\", entitled \"New brighter day\".",
