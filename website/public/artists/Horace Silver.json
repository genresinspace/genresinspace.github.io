  "description": "'''Horace Ward Martin Tavares Silver'''{{refn|group=note|According to Silver, his father's surname was originally \"Silva\", but was changed upon marriage to \"Silver\", while his own baptismal name was \"Horace Ward Silver\", which then had his father's middle name added, as well as \"Martin\" upon his Catholic [[confirmation]], making him Horace Ward Martin Tavares Silver.{{sfn|Silver|2006|p=3}}}} (September 2, 1928 â€“ June 18, 2014) was an American [[jazz]] pianist, composer, and arranger, particularly in the [[hard bop]] style that he helped pioneer in the 1950s.\n\nAfter playing tenor saxophone and piano at school in [[Connecticut]], Silver got his break on piano when his trio was recruited by [[Stan Getz]] in 1950. Silver soon moved to New York City, where he developed a reputation as a composer and for his bluesy playing. Frequent sideman recordings in the mid-1950s helped further, but it was his work with [[the Jazz Messengers]], co-led by [[Art Blakey]], that brought both his writing and playing most attention. Their ''[[Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers]]'' album contained Silver's first hit, \"[[The Preacher (Horace Silver song)|The Preacher]]\". After leaving Blakey in 1956, Silver formed his own quintet, with what became the standard small group line-up of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums. Their public performances and frequent recordings for [[Blue Note Records]] increased Silver's popularity, even through changes of personnel. His most successful album was ''[[Song for My Father (album)|Song for My Father]]'', made with two iterations of the quintet in 1963 and 1964.\n\nSeveral changes occurred in the early 1970s: Silver disbanded his group to spend more time with his wife and to concentrate on composing; he included lyrics in his recordings; and his interest in spiritualism developed. The last two of these were often combined, resulting in commercially unsuccessful releases such as ''[[The United States of Mind]]'' series. Silver left Blue Note after 28 years, founded his own record label, and scaled back his touring in the 1980s, relying in part on royalties from his compositions for income. In 1993, he returned to major record labels, releasing five albums before gradually withdrawing from public view because of health problems.\n\nAs a player, Silver transitioned from [[bebop]] to hard bop by stressing melody rather than complex harmony, and combined clean and often humorous right-hand lines with darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual left-hand rumble. His compositions similarly emphasized catchy melodies, but often also contained dissonant harmonies. Many of his varied repertoire of songs, including \"[[Doodlin' (Horace Silver song)|Doodlin]]{{'\"}}, \"[[Peace (Horace Silver song)|Peace]]\", and \"[[Sister Sadie]]\", became [[jazz standard]]s that are still widely played. His considerable legacy encompasses his influence on other pianists and composers, and the development of young jazz talents who appeared in his bands over the course of four decades.",
