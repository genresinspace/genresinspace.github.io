  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''Babymetal'''|ベビーメタル|Bebīmetaru|lead=yes}} (stylized in [[all caps]] as '''BABYMETAL''') is a Japanese [[kawaii metal]] band consisting of [[Suzuka Nakamoto]] as \"Su-metal\", [[Moa Kikuchi]] as \"Moametal\" and [[Momoko Okazaki]] as \"Momometal\". The band is produced by [[Kobametal]] from the [[Amuse Inc.|Amuse talent agency]]. Their vocals are backed by heavy metal instrumentation, performed by a group of [[session musicians]] known as the \"Kami Band\" at performances.\n\nThe band was formed in 2010, with the original lineup of Su-metal (vocal and dance), Moametal (scream and dance), and [[Yui Mizuno]] as \"Yuimetal\" (scream and dance), with the concept of creating a fusion of the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Japanese idol]] genres. Originally a sub-unit of the Japanese idol group [[Sakura Gakuin]], Babymetal became an independent act in 2013, following Nakamoto's departure from Sakura Gakuin.\n\nBabymetal have released four studio albums since their inception: the first, ''[[Babymetal (album)|Babymetal]]'', came out in February 2014. Their second album ''[[Metal Resistance]]'' was released in April 2016. The group released their third album ''[[Metal Galaxy]]'' in October 2019. Their fourth album, ''[[The Other One (Babymetal album)|The Other One]]'', was released in March 2023. Babymetal has embarked on several tours, with a majority of their tour dates taking place outside of Asia.\n\nIn October 2018, Babymetal announced that Yui Mizuno had decided to leave the band due to poor health after having been absent from live performances since December 2017. After December 2017, the band performed with one or more [[backup dancers]] at live performances. One of those dancers, Momoko Okazaki (a former member of Sakura Gakuin), joined Babymetal as the third core member in April 2023, under the stage name Momometal.",
