At the end of 2012, Cook, Fatt and Page retired and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce and [[Emma Watkins]].

Watkins departed the group in 2021, with the group subsequently adopting an expanded line-up of eight members.\n\nField and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band [[the Cockroaches]] in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at [[Macquarie University]], where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and he enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with [[The Wiggles characters|costumed characters]] Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus and Wags the Dog, as well as the human character Captain Feathersword, played by [[Paul Paddick]] since 1993. Shirley Shawn the Unicorn was later introduced. They originally travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's albums, DVDs and television programs have been produced independently since their inception.
