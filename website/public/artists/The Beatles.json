  "description": "'''The Beatles''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. They are widely regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band]] in Western [[popular music]] and were integral to the development of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and the recognition of popular music as an art form.{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}}{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As [[Recording practices of the Beatles|pioneers in recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennonâ€“McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, [[the Quarrymen]], and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]], Germany, starting in 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act, and producer [[George Martin]] developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with [[EMI]] and achieved their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or other members of the band's entourage were sometimes informally referred to as a \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the [[British Invasion]] of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication, including ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967). They enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). The success of these records heralded the [[album era]], increased public interest in [[psychedelic drug]]s and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in [[electronic music]], [[album art]] and [[music video]]s. In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists. While some [[Collaborations between ex-Beatles|partial reunions]] occurred over the next decade, the four members never reunited. Lennon [[Murder of John Lennon|was murdered]] in 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music act of all time]], with estimated sales of 600&nbsp;million units worldwide. They are the most successful act in the history of the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], with the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#|most number-one hits]] on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart (20), and they hold the record for most number-one albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]] (15) and most singles sold in the UK (21.9&nbsp;million). The band received [[List of awards and nominations received by the Beatles|many accolades]], including eight [[Grammy Awards]], four [[Brit Awards]], an [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score#1970s|Best Original Song Score]] for the 1970 documentary film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'') and fifteen [[Ivor Novello Awards]]. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility, 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s lists of [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|the greatest artists in history]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named them among the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|20th century's 100 most important people]].",
