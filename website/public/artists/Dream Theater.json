  "description": "'''Dream Theater''' is an American [[progressive metal]] band formed in 1985 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].  The band comprises [[John Petrucci]] (guitar), [[John Myung]] (bass), [[Mike Portnoy]] (drums), [[James LaBrie]] (vocals) and [[Jordan Rudess]] (keyboards).\n\nDream Theater was formed under the name '''Majesty''' by Petrucci, Myung and Portnoy—all natives of [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]—while they attended [[Berklee College of Music]]. They dropped out to concentrate on the band. Dream Theater has undergone various lineup changes, with Petrucci and Myung being the only constant members. Portnoy remained until 2010, when he was replaced by [[Mike Mangini]] after deciding to leave to pursue other musical projects, before rejoining the band in October 2023. After a brief stint with Chris Collins, followed by [[Charlie Dominici]] (who was dismissed from Dream Theater shortly after the release of their 1989 debut album ''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]''), LaBrie was hired as the band's singer in 1991. Dream Theater's original keyboardist, [[Kevin Moore]], left the band after three albums and was replaced by [[Derek Sherinian]] in 1995 after a period of touring. The band recorded [[Falling into Infinity|one album]] (and [[A Change of Seasons|an EP]]) with Sherinian, who was replaced by current keyboardist [[Jordan Rudess]] in 1999.\n\nDream Theater has released sixteen studio albums. The band's highest-selling release is their second album ''[[Images and Words]]'' (1992), which reached No.&nbsp;61 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Other albums such as ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'' (1994) and ''[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]'' (2002) also entered the charts at No.&nbsp;32 and No.&nbsp;46 respectively, and each received critical acclaim. Their fifth album, ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' (1999), was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It was also ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album in March 2003 by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine.\n\nBy 2018, Dream Theater had sold over 12 million records worldwide; they have received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations, including one win in 2022. Along with [[Queensrÿche]] and [[Fates Warning]], the band has been referred to as one of the \"big three\" of the progressive metal genre, responsible for its development and popularization.\n{{TOC limit}}",
