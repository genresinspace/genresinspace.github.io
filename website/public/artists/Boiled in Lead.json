  "description": "'''Boiled in Lead''' is a [[Folk punk|folk-punk]]/[[worldbeat]] band based in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, and founded in 1983. Tim Walters of ''[[MusicHound]] Folk'' called the group \"the most important folk-rock band to appear since the 1970s.\" Influential record producer and musician [[Steve Albini]] called the band's [[Boiled in Lead (album)|self-titled first album]] \"the most impressive debut record from a rock band I've heard all year.\" Their style, sometimes called \"rock 'n' reel,\" is heavily influenced by both [[folk music|traditional folk music]] and [[punk rock]], and has drawn them praise as one of the few American bands of the 1980s and 1990s to expand on [[Fairport Convention]]'s rocked-up take on traditional folk. ''Folk Roots'' magazine noted that Boiled in Lead's \"folk-punk\" approach synthesized the idealistic and archival approach of 1960s folk music with the burgeoning American alternative-rock scene of the early 1980s typified by [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] The band also incorporates a plethora of international musical traditions, including Russian, Turkish, Bulgarian, Scottish, Vietnamese, Hungarian, African, klezmer, and Romani music. \n\nBoiled in Lead has been hailed as a pioneering bridge between American rock and international music, and a precursor to [[Gogol Bordello]] and other gypsy-punk bands. While most heavily active in the 1980s and 1990s, the group is still performing today, including annual St. Patrick's Day concerts in Minneapolis. Over the course of its career, Boiled in Lead has released nearly a dozen albums and EPs, most recently 2012's ''[[The Well Below]]''. A new studio album, ''King of the Dogwoods'', will be released in October 2025.",
