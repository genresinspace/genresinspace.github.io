The band pioneered progressive rock in the 1970s, particularly with their critically-acclaimed albums ''[[The Yes Album]]'', ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]'' (both 1971) and ''[[Close to the Edge]]'' (1972) which display Anderson's role in crafting the group's sound as one of the main songwriters and lyricists. Known for his [[countertenor]] vocal style, Anderson was a member of Yes across three tenures until 2004.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Accrington]] in northern England, Anderson gave up manual labour in the early 1960s in favour of singing in [[The Warriors (British band)|The Warriors]] with his brother. He moved to London and after several unsuccessful singles as a solo artist, co-formed Yes with Squire. Anderson left the band in 1980 due to growing internal friction and continued his solo career, which he had started in 1976 with his debut album, ''[[Olias of Sunhillow]]''. He went on to collaborate with other musicians, including Greek keyboardist and composer [[Vangelis]] as [[Jon and Vangelis]], [[Roine Stolt]] as [[Invention of Knowledge|Anderson/Stolt]], [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] as the Anderson Ponty Band, and [[Richie Castellano#Band_Geeks|The Band Geeks]] as [[True (Jon Anderson album)|Jon Anderson and the Band Geeks]], with whom he has toured repeatedly and released two albums in recent years. He has appeared on albums by [[King Crimson]], [[Toto (band)|Toto]], [[Lawrence Gowan]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Battles (band)|Battles]], [[Mike Oldfield]] and [[Kitaro]]. Anderson was a member of the offshoot Yes groups [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] and [[Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman]].\n\nIn 2009, Anderson acquired American citizenship. In 2017, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Yes.",
