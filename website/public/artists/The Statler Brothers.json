  "description": "'''The Statler Brothers''' (sometimes simply referred to as '''The Statlers''') were an American [[country music]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and vocal group from [[Staunton, Virginia]]. The quartet was formed in 1955 performing locally, and from 1964 to 1972, they sang as opening act and backup singers for [[Johnny Cash]].\n\nOriginally performing [[Southern gospel]] music at local churches, the group billed themselves as The Four Star Quartet, and later The Kingsmen. In 1963, when the song \"[[Louie, Louie]]\" by the [[garage rock]] band also called [[The Kingsmen]] became famous, the group elected to bill themselves as the Statler Brothers.  Despite the name, only two members of the group (Don and Harold Reid) were actual brothers and no member had the surname of Statler. The group actually named themselves after a brand of [[facial tissue]] they had noticed in a hotel room (they later quipped that they could just as easily have named themselves \"the [[Kleenex]] Brothers\"). Don Reid sang [[lead singer|lead]]; Harold Reid, Don's older brother, sang [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]; Phil Balsley sang [[baritone]]; and [[Lew DeWitt]] sang [[tenor]] and was the [[guitarist]] before being replaced due to ill health by [[Jimmy Fortune]] in 1981.\n\nThe band's style was closely linked to their gospel roots. \"We took gospel harmonies,\" said Harold Reid, \"and put them over in country music.\" Most of their albums contain at least one gospel song, and they produced several containing only gospel. They also recorded a tribute song to [[The Blackwood Brothers]], who influenced their music. The song \"We Got Paid by Cash\" was written by the Statler Brothers as a tribute to Johnny Cash, who discovered and mentored them.",
