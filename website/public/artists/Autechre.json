  "description": "'''Autechre''' ({{IPAc-en|ɔː|ˈ|t|ɛ|k|ər}} {{Respell|aw|TEK|ər}}) are an English [[electronic music]] duo consisting of Rob Brown and Sean Booth, both from [[Rochdale]], [[Greater Manchester]]. Formed in 1987, they are among the best known acts signed to UK electronic label [[Warp Records]], through which all of Autechre's full-length albums have been released beginning with their 1993 debut ''[[Incunabula (album)|Incunabula]]''. They gained initial recognition when they were featured on Warp's 1992 compilation ''[[Artificial Intelligence (compilation album)|Artificial Intelligence]]''.\n\nInfluenced by styles such as 1980s [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[hip-hop]], the music of Autechre has evolved throughout their career from early, melodic [[techno]] recordings to later works often considered abstract and experimental, featuring complex composition and few stylistic conventions. Their work has been associated with the 1990s electronic genre known as [[intelligent dance music]] (IDM), though Booth has dismissed the label as \"silly\".",
