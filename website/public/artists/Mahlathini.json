  "description": "'''Simon \"Mahlathini\" Nkabinde''' (1937 or 1938 – 27 July 1999) was a South African ''[[mbaqanga]]'' singer. Known as the \"Lion of [[Soweto]]\", Nkabinde is the acknowledged exponent of the deep-voiced, [[basso profundo]] \"groaning\" style that came to symbolize mbaqanga music in the 1960s. Nkabinde was also a very active live performer in South Africa, recording and performing with the [[Mahotella Queens]] and the backing [[Makgona Tsohle Band]] from 1964 to 1971, and then again from 1983 to 1999. The [[Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens]] act was propelled into international stardom in the wake of [[Paul Simon]]'s 1986 ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' album.",
