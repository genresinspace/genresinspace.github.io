Nekroman has been the sole constant member of the band. The current lineup consists of guitarist Francisco Mesa and drummer Mike Mata.\n\nThe Nekromantix released five albums on various European record labels during their first decade, then crossed over to American audiences in the early 2000s by signing to [[Los Angeles]]–based [[Hellcat Records]], through which they have released three albums since 2002. Their eighth studio album, ''[[What Happens in Hell, Stays in Hell]]'', was released in August 2011.",
