  "description": "'''Gustav Elijah Åhr''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈoːr|lang}}; November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as '''Lil Peep''', was an American rapper and singer-songwriter. He was a member of the hip-hop collective [[GothBoiClique]], and is credited as being a leading figure of the [[emo rap]] sub-genre, and an inspiration in alternative [[youth subculture]]s.\n\nBorn in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], to an American mother and a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] father and raised on [[Long Island]], Åhr started producing and releasing music on [[SoundCloud]] in 2013 under the name '''Trap Goose''', later changing his stage name to Lil Peep because his mother had called him \"Peep\" since he was a baby. Two years later, in 2015, he emerged as an immensely popular musician on the platform following the release of his single \"[[Star Shopping]]\", and his popularity grew further with his release of mixtapes ''[[Lil Peep; Part One]]'' and [[Live Forever (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Live Forever'']] later that year. In 2016, Lil Peep released his widely acclaimed mixtapes [[Crybaby (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Crybaby'']] and [[Hellboy (Lil Peep mixtape)|''Hellboy'']]. He also participated in collaborative musical projects, leading to the release of [[Lil Peep discography|''California Girls'']] and [[Lil Peep discography|''Vertigo'']].\n\nLil Peep's first live performance was as a member of Schemaposse on February 12, 2016, in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Later that year, he toured briefly with [[Fat Nick]], [[Smokepurpp]], and others. In the spring of 2017, Lil Peep embarked on his first solo tour, performing to packed venues in three Russian cities, making his way across western Europe, and then across the United States. Soon after the tour, Lil Peep moved to London, where he recorded his EP ''[[Goth Angel Sinner]]'', and in August he released his debut studio album, ''[[Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1]]''.\n\nWhile his mixtapes explored [[emo]], [[Trap music|trap]], [[lo-fi]] and [[alternative rock]], his debut album was a transition into [[pop punk]] and [[rap rock]]. His second album, ''[[Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2]]'', was released in 2018 and debuted at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. A documentary film about him, ''[[Everybody's Everything (film)|Everybody's Everything]]'', was released in 2019.\n\nOn November 15, 2017, two weeks after his 21st birthday, Lil Peep died on his tour bus before a scheduled performance in Tucson, his second to last scheduled show on a 33-date tour of the United States. The [[Pima County]] medical examiner's office, which conducted [[toxicology]] tests on Lil Peep, ruled his cause of death an accidental overdose of [[fentanyl]], a powerful [[opioid]], and [[alprazolam]], a [[benzodiazepine]] [[sedative]]. His death was observed as a great loss to 21st-century music. \"He could have been his generation's [[Kurt Cobain]]\", a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' profile stated.",
