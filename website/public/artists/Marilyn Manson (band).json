  "name": "Marilyn Manson",
  "description": "'''Marilyn Manson''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed by namesake lead singer [[Marilyn Manson]] and guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in 1989. Originally named '''Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids''', they gained a local [[cult following]] in [[South Florida]] in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances. In 1993, they were the first act signed to [[Trent Reznor]]'s [[Nothing Records]] label. Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female [[sex symbol]] and the last name of a male serial {{nowrap|killer{{px2}}{{mdash}}{{px2}}}}for example, [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Charles Manson]]. Their lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the eponymous lead singer is the only remaining original member.\n\nIn the past, band members dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, and engaged in intentionally [[shock value|shocking]] behavior both onstage and off. Their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their live performances were frequently called offensive and [[obscenity|obscene]]. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at [[State ownership|state-owned]] venues. They released a number of [[Music recording sales certification|platinum-selling albums]], including ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998). These albums, along with their highly stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. In 1999, news media, infamously, falsely [[Marilyn Mansonâ€“Columbine High School massacre controversy|blamed the band for influencing]] [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|the perpetrators]] of the [[Columbine High School massacre]].\n\nAs this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of [[MTV]], in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as \"the only true artist today\". Marilyn Manson is widely regarded as being one of the most iconic and controversial figures in rock music, with the band and its lead singer influencing numerous other groups and musicians, both in metal-associated acts and also in wider popular culture. [[VH1]] ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on their ''100 Great Artists of Hard Rock''. They were inducted into the ''[[Kerrang!]]'' Hall of Fame in 2000 and have been nominated for four [[Grammy Award]]s. In the U.S., the band has seen ten of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Marilyn Manson have sold in excess of 50 million records worldwide.\n{{toc limit|3}}",
