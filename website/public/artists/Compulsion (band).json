  "description": "'''Compulsion''' were an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[punk rock|punk]] band.  They were formed in 1990 by Josephmary (singer) and [[Sid Rainey]] (bassist) as '''Thee Amazing Colossal Men'''.  They signed a [[recording contract]] with [[Virgin Records]], but after winning a lawsuit against their [[record label]], they became 'Compulsion' in 1992.  Joined by guitarist [[Garret Lee]] and drummer Jan-Willem Alkema, they moved to [[North London]] and signed to [[One Little Indian]].  They released several [[Extended play|EP]]s and two [[album]]s.  The first, ''Comforter'', was labeled by the ''[[NME]]'' as part of the \"[[New Wave of New Wave]]\", while the second, ''The Future is Medium'', saw them sport identical black outfits and orange hairdos.\n\nThe group split in 1997 after the label [[One Little Indian]] dropped them. After Compulsion, Lee formed [[Jacknife Lee]], and later produced [[Snow Patrol]] and [[U2]].  Alkema joined [[China Drum]] and later Driven to Collision. Rainey is now a writer and has created and produced an animated children's TV series called ''[[Underground Ernie]]'' for the [[BBC]].  Josephmary now lives in Ireland.",
