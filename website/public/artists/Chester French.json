  "description": "'''Chester French''' was an American [[indie pop]] band consisting of [[lead vocalist]] and [[songwriter]] [[D.A. Wallach|David-Andrew 'D.A.' Wallach]], and [[multi-instrumentalist]] Maxwell Drummey. They met as college students at [[Harvard University]], naming their band after sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]], who designed the statue at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], the [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] statue, as well as the [[Minuteman]] statue at the [[Minute Man National Historical Park|Lexington/Concord]] battlegrounds in [[Massachusetts]].\n\n[[Milwaukee]]-raised Wallach and [[Boston]] native Drummey formed the band with three other classmates, playing various campus functions, and ultimately moved in a direction influenced by classic British [[Northern Soul]]. Wallach handled most of the vocals, while Drummey performed much of the composition with instruments, supplemented with an occasional special guest.",
