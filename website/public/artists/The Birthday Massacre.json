  "description": "'''The Birthday Massacre''' (abbreviated TBM) is a Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1999 in [[London, Ontario]] and currently based in [[Toronto]]. The current lineup consists of lead vocalist Sara 'Chibi' Taylor, rhythm guitarist Michael Rainbow, lead guitarist Michael Falcore, keyboardist Owen Mackinder, drummer Philip Elliott, and bassist [[A Primitive Evolution|Brett Carruthers]].\n\nWhen the band formed in 1999, they were known as 'Imagica'. This name was inspired by the 1991 [[fantasy novel]] ''[[Imajica]]'' by [[Clive Barker]]. In 2002, they changed the name to The Birthday Massacre after one of their earlier songs in order to avoid confusion with another group. The song “The Birthday Massacre” was then renamed “Happy Birthday”. According to their vocalist Chibi: \"it kind of works well for the music that we're making. Sort of contrasty, you know? Birthday, and massacre. Light, and dark. Cute, and evil\".\n\nThe band has released ten studio albums: ''[[Nothing and Nowhere]]'' (2002), ''[[Violet (The Birthday Massacre album)|Violet]]'' (2005), ''[[Walking with Strangers]]'' (2007), ''[[Pins and Needles (The Birthday Massacre album)|Pins and Needles]]'' (2010), ''[[Hide and Seek (The Birthday Massacre album)|Hide and Seek]]'' (2012), ''[[Superstition (The Birthday Massacre album)|Superstition]]'' (2014), ''[[Under Your Spell (The Birthday Massacre album)|Under Your Spell]]'' (2017), ''[[Diamonds (The Birthday Massacre album)|Diamonds]]'' (2020), ''Fascination'' (2022), and ''Pathways'' (2025).\n\nThey also issued the DVD ''[[Blue (DVD)|Blue]]'' (2005), the live album/DVD ''[[Show and Tell (The Birthday Massacre album)|Show and Tell]]'' (2009), the demo album ''[[Imagica (album)|Imagica]]'', and the [[extended play|EPs]] ''[[Violet (The Birthday Massacre album)|Violet]]'' (2004), ''[[Looking Glass (EP)|Looking Glass]]'' (2008), and ''[[Imaginary Monsters]]'' (2011).",
