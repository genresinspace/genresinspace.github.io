  "description": "'''Woodrow Wilson Guthrie''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|V|T|r|i|}}; July 14, 1912&nbsp;– October 3, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, and composer widely considered to be one of the most significant figures in [[American folk music]]. His work focused on themes of [[American Left|American socialism]] and [[anti-fascism]] and has inspired many generations both politically and musically with songs such as \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\" and \"[[Tear the fascists down|Tear the Fascists Down]]\".\n\nGuthrie wrote hundreds of [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Children's music|children's]] songs, along with [[ballad]]s and improvised works. ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', Guthrie's album of songs about the [[Dust Bowl]] period, was included on ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed the World, and many of his recorded songs are archived in the [[Library of Congress]]. Songwriters who have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence on their work include [[Steve Earle]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Donovan]], [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]], [[Harry Chapin]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Brian Fallon]], [[AJJ (band)|Sean Bonnette]], and [[Sixto Rodríguez]]. Guthrie frequently performed with the message \"[[This machine kills fascists]]\" displayed on his guitar.\n\nGuthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in [[Okemah, Oklahoma]]. He left Okemah in 1929, after his mother, suffering from the Huntington’s disease that would later kill him too, was institutionalized. Guthrie followed his wayward father to [[Pampa, Texas]], where the elder Guthrie was running a seedy flophouse. \"Pampa was a Texas oil boom town and wilder than a woodchuck,\" Guthrie wrote in his autobiography, and though he lived there for just eight years, the town’s influence on him and his music was undeniable.  He married at 20, but with the advent of the [[dust storm]]s that marked the [[Dust Bowl]] period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of [[History of Texas#Great Depression|Texans]] and [[Okie]]s who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station [[KTNQ|KFVD]], achieving some fame from playing [[hillbilly music]], made friends with [[Will Geer]] and [[John Steinbeck]], and wrote a column for the [[communist]] newspaper ''[[People's World]]'' from May 1939 to January 1940.\n\nThroughout his life, Guthrie was associated with [[CPUSA|United States communist]] groups, although he apparently did not belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop]] non-aggression pact the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings after he wrote a song praising the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. He left the station, ending up in New York, where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\". In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\". He said it was a response to what he felt was the overplaying of [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\" on the radio.\n\nGuthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son [[Arlo Guthrie]] became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of [[Huntington's disease]]. His first two daughters also died of the disease.",
