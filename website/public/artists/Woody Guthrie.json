  "name": "Woody Guthrie",
  "description": "'''Woodrow Wilson Guthrie''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|V|T|r|i|}}; July 14, 1912&nbsp;– October 3, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, and composer widely considered one of the most significant figures in [[American folk music]]. His work focused on themes of [[American Left|American socialism]] and [[anti-fascism]] and has inspired many generations politically and musically with songs such as \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\" and \"[[Tear the fascists down|Tear the Fascists Down]]\".\n\nGuthrie wrote hundreds of [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Children's music|children's]] songs, along with [[ballad]]s and improvised works. ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', Guthrie's album of songs about the [[Dust Bowl]] period, was included on ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''<nowiki/>'s list of 100 Records That Changed the World, and many of his recorded songs are archived in the [[Library of Congress]]. Songwriters who have acknowledged Guthrie as an influence include [[Steve Earle]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Donovan]], [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]], [[Harry Chapin]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Weir]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Brian Fallon]], [[AJJ (band)|Sean Bonnette]], and [[Sixto Rodríguez]]. Guthrie frequently performed with the message \"[[This machine kills fascists]]\" displayed on his guitar.\n\nGuthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in [[Okemah, Oklahoma]]. He left Okemah in 1929, after his mother, suffering from the [[Huntington’s disease]] that would later kill him too, was institutionalized. Guthrie followed his wayward father to [[Pampa, Texas]], where he was running a [[flophouse]]. Though Guthrie lived there for just eight years, the town's influence on him and his music was undeniable.  He married at 20, but with the advent of the [[dust storm]]s that marked the [[Dust Bowl]] period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of [[History of Texas#Great Depression|Texans]] and [[Okie]]s who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at the Los Angeles radio station [[KTNQ|KFVD]], achieving some fame from playing [[hillbilly music]], befriended [[Will Geer]] and [[John Steinbeck]], and wrote a column for the [[communist]] newspaper ''[[People's World]]'' from May 1939 to January 1940.\n\nThroughout his life, Guthrie was associated with [[CPUSA|United States communist]] groups, although he apparently did not belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov–Ribbentrop]] non-aggression pact the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings after he wrote a song praising the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. He left the station and went to New York, where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\". In February 1940, he wrote his most famous song, \"This Land Is Your Land\", a response to what he felt was the overplaying of [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\" on the radio.\n\nGuthrie married three times and fathered eight children. His son [[Arlo Guthrie]] became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of Huntington's disease, inherited from his mother. His first two daughters also died of the disease.",
