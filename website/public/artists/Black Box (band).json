  "description": "'''Black Box''' is an Italian [[house music]] group popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group is currently made up of DJ Daniele Davoli, classically trained clarinet teacher Valerio Semplici, keyboardist and electronic musician Mirko Limoni, and vocalist Celestine Walcott-Gordon. French fashion model Katrin Quinol joined the act in 1989 and became the official face of Black Box, appearing on the cover of their single and album releases as well as in music videos, including the hit \"[[Ride on Time]]\", which was the highest-selling single of 1989 in the UK. The following year, it was revealed that Quinol was [[lip-syncing]] and had not performed on the recording. American singer [[Martha Wash]] performed the majority of the songs on the group's debut album, ''[[Dreamland (Black Box album)|Dreamland]]'', while being uncredited.",
