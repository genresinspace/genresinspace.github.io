  "description": "'''Canned Heat''' is an American [[blues rock]] band that was formed in Los Angeles in 1965. The group has been noted for its efforts to promote interest in blues music and its original artists. It was launched by two blues enthusiasts, [[Alan Wilson (musician)|Alan Wilson]] and [[Bob Hite]], who took the name from [[Tommy Johnson (guitarist)|Tommy Johnson]]'s 1928 \"Canned Heat Blues\", a song about an alcoholic who had desperately turned to drinking [[Sterno]], generically called \"canned heat\". After appearances at the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey]] and [[Woodstock]] festivals at the end of the 1960s, the band acquired worldwide fame with a lineup of Hite (vocals), Wilson (guitar, harmonica and vocals), [[Henry Vestine]] and later [[Harvey Mandel]] (lead guitar), [[Larry Taylor]] (bass), and [[Adolfo de la Parra]] (drums).\n\nThe music and attitude of Canned Heat attracted a large following and established the band as one of the popular acts of the [[hippie]] era. Canned Heat appeared at most major musical events at the end of the 1960s, performing blues standards along with their own material and occasionally indulging in lengthy \"[[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]]\" solos. Three of their songs—\"[[Going Up the Country]]\",  \"[[On the Road Again (Canned Heat song)|On the Road Again]]\", and \"[[Let's Work Together]]\"—became international hits.\n\nSince the early 1970s, following the early death of Wilson, numerous personnel changes have occurred. For much of the 1990s and 2000s and following Taylor's death in 2019, de la Parra has been the only member from the band's 1960s lineup. [[Walter Trout]] and [[Junior Watson]] are among the guitarists who played in later editions of the band.",
