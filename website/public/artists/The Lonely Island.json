  "description": "'''The Lonely Island''' is an American comedy trio, formed by [[Andy Samberg]], [[Jorma Taccone]], and [[Akiva Schaffer]] in [[Berkeley, California]], in 2001. They have written for and starred in the American TV program ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'').\n\nThe three first met in junior high. After graduating from college, they regrouped and moved to [[Los Angeles]], where they struggled to find work and began making short films, combining absurdist comedy and occasionally music. Among the first performers to post their material on the Internet, they involved themselves with [[Channel 101]], a non-profit monthly short film festival. Their popularity at the screenings led to unsuccessful pilot deals with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Comedy Central]] and a writing job for the [[2005 MTV Movie Awards]]. Subsequently, that show's host, [[Jimmy Fallon]], recommended them to [[Lorne Michaels]], the creator of ''Saturday Night Live''.\n\nThe group was hired for ''SNL'' in 2005, with all three as writers and Samberg as a featured player. Bypassing the traditional process of pitching, they recorded their own material independently and submitted it to the program. Their second sketch to air, \"[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]\", became an internet sensation, the first of many viral videos they produced while at ''SNL''. They led their own division at the program — [[SNL Digital Short|''SNL'' Digital Shorts]] — which led to numerous viral videos, including \"[[Motherlover]]\", \"[[Dick in a Box]]\", \"[[Jizz in My Pants]]\", \"[[I'm on a Boat]]\", \"[[Like a Boss]]\", \"[[I Just Had Sex]]\", \"[[Jack Sparrow (song)|Jack Sparrow]]\", and \"[[YOLO (The Lonely Island song)|YOLO]]\". Their musical comedic work has comprised four full [[studio album]]s: ''[[Incredibad]]'' (2009), ''[[Turtleneck & Chain]]'' (2011), ''[[The Wack Album]]'' (2013), and ''[[The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience#Album|The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience]]'' (2019), along with a soundtrack album for their 2016 film ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]''. The three retired from ''SNL'' in the early 2010s, but occasionally make guest appearances.\n\nThe troupe has written, directed and starred in two feature-length films, ''[[Hot Rod (2007 film)|Hot Rod]]'', released in 2007, and ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]'', co-produced by [[Judd Apatow]] and released in 2016. The group also produced the 2020 film ''[[Palm Springs (2020 film)|Palm Springs]]'', starring Samberg and [[Cristin Milioti]].",
