  "description": "'''Charles Arthur Russell Jr.''' (May 21, 1951 – April 4, 1992) was an American cellist, composer, producer, singer, and musician from [[Iowa]], whose work spanned a disparate range of styles. After studying [[contemporary classical music|contemporary composition]] and [[Indian classical music]] in California, Russell relocated to New York City in the mid-1970s, where he became involved in [[Lower Manhattan]]'s [[avant-garde]] community and later the city's burgeoning [[disco]] scene. His eclectic music was often marked by adventurous production choices and his soft [[tenor]] vocals.\n\nRussell worked as musical director of the New York avant-garde venue [[The Kitchen (art institution)|The Kitchen]] in 1974 and 1975, but later embraced [[dance music]], producing or co-producing several underground club hits under names such as '''Dinosaur L''', '''Loose Joints''', and '''Indian Ocean''' between 1978 and 1988. He co-founded the independent label [[Sleeping Bag Records]] with Will Socolov in 1981, and collaborated with a wide variety of artists, including musicians [[Peter Gordon (composer)|Peter Gordon]], [[Peter Zummo]], and [[Talking Heads]], DJs such as [[Walter Gibbons]], [[Nicky Siano]], and [[Steve D'Aquisto]]; and poet [[Allen Ginsberg]].\n\nThe only full-length studio albums Russell issued under his name were the orchestral recording ''[[Tower of Meaning]]'' (1983) and vocal LP ''[[World of Echo]] '' (1986); he also released the disco LP ''[[24→24 Music]]'' (1981) under his Dinosaur L alias. Over the last two decades of his life, he amassed a large collection of unreleased and unfinished recordings, in part due to his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]] working tendencies. He died from AIDS-related illnesses in 1992, still in relative obscurity and poverty.\n\nRussell's profile rose in the 21st century owing to a series of musical releases (including collections of previously unreleased material) and biographical works. Several posthumous compilations of his music were released, including ''[[The World of Arthur Russell]]'' (2004) and ''[[Calling Out of Context]]'' (2004). The documentary ''[[Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell]]'' was released in 2008.",
