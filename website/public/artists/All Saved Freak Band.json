  "name": "All Saved Freak Band",
  "description": "The '''All Saved Freak Band''' was one of the earliest influences in what has since become a distinct sub-category of Rock and Roll, [[Contemporary Christian Music]]. Broadcasting their first recorded songs on WREO radio in [[Ashtabula County, Ohio]], in the fall of 1968, ASFB joined [[Larry Norman]] and the California group, Agape, as one of the original \"pioneers\" of [[Jesus music]], birthed in that same year.\n\nASFB was a large, ensemble group of 12 musicians. Their music was known for its combination of blues and string arrangements. ASFB recorded four albums now recognized as classic examples of the earliest \"Jesus music.\" Though courted by RCA and Columbia, ASFB never signed a contract in an effort to maintain control of the band's music and direction.",
