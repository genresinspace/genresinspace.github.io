  "description": "'''Chumbawamba''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|ʌ|m|b|ə|ˈ|w|ɒ|m|b|ə}}) was a British [[anarcho-punk]] band who formed in 1982 and disbanded in 2012. They are best known for their 1997 single \"[[Tubthumping]]\", which was nominated for [[Brit Awards 1998#The awards|Best British Single]] at the [[Brit Awards 1998]]. Other singles include \"[[Amnesia (Chumbawamba song)|Amnesia]]\", \"[[Enough Is Enough (Chumbawamba song)|Enough Is Enough]]\" (with [[Credit to the Nation]]), \"[[Timebomb (Chumbawamba song)|Timebomb]]\", \"[[Top of the World (Olé, Olé, Olé)]]\", and \"Add Me\". Their [[anarcho-communist]] political leanings led them to have an irreverent attitude toward authority, and to espouse a variety of political and social causes including [[animal rights]] and [[pacifism]] (early in their career) and later regarding [[class struggle]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],  and [[anti-fascism]].\n\nFor most of their career, the band had a 7–8 piece lineup and drew from a wide range of musical styles, including [[punk rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music|folk]]. While their first two albums were largely punk and pop-influenced, their third was an entirely a capella album of traditional songs. In 2004, several long-term members left the band, which continued with a 4-piece (later 5-piece) acoustic lineup, with more folk-influenced output.\n\nIn July 2012, Chumbawamba announced they were splitting up after 30 years. The band was joined by former members and collaborators for three final shows between 31 October and 3 November 2012, one of which was filmed and released as a live [[DVD]].",
