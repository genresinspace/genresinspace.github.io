  "description": "'''Donald Hugh Walker''' (born 29 November 1951) is an Australian musician and songwriter who wrote many of the hits for [[Pub rock (Australia)|Australian pub rock]] band [[Cold Chisel]]. \nWalker is considered to be one of Australia's best songwriters. In 2012 he was inducted into the Australian Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nHe played piano and keyboard with Cold Chisel from 1973 to 1983, when they disbanded. He has since continued to record and tour, both solo, initially under the name '''Catfish''' and as [[Tex, Don and Charlie]], and worked as a songwriter for others. In 2009, he released his first book.\n\n[[Richard Clapton]] describes Walker as, \"the most Australian writer there has ever been. Don just digs being a sort of Beat poet, who goes around observing, especially around the streets of [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]. He soaks it up like a sponge and articulates it so well. Quite frankly, I think he's better than the rest of us.\"",
