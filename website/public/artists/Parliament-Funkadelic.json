  "description": "'''Parliament-Funkadelic''' (abbreviated as '''P-Funk''') is an American [[musical collective|music collective]] of rotating musicians headed by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], primarily consisting of the [[funk]] bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]], both active since the 1960s. With an eclectic style drawing on [[psychedelia]], outlandish fashion, and surreal humor, they have released albums such as ''[[Maggot Brain]]'' (1971), ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' (1975), and ''[[One Nation Under a Groove]]'' (1978) to critical praise, and scored charting hits with singles such as \"[[Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)|Tear the Roof Off the Sucker]]\" (1975) and \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\" (1978). Overall, the collective achieved thirteen top ten hits in the American R&B music charts between 1967 and 1983, including six number one hits. Their work has had an influential effect on subsequent funk, [[post-punk]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[techno]] artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their [[P-Funk mythology|collective mythology]] has helped pioneer [[Afrofuturism]].\n\nThe collective's origins date back to the [[doo-wop]] group [[the Parliaments]], formed by Clinton during the late 1950s in suburban [[New Jersey]]. By the late 1960s, Clinton had gained experience as a producer-writer for [[Motown Records]] and, inspired by artists such as [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Sly Stone]], and [[Frank Zappa]], he relocated to [[Detroit]] and enlisted musicians from his New Jersey days in his own two sister bands Parliament and Funkadelic; the first would go on to develop a commercially successful style of [[science fiction]]â€“inspired funk, while the second pursued a heavier sound which blended funk with [[psychedelic rock]]. The name \"Parliament-Funkadelic\" became the catch-all term for [[List of P Funk members|the dozens of related musicians]] recording and touring different projects in Clinton's orbit, including the female vocal spinoff groups [[the Brides of Funkenstein]] and [[Parlet]]. Financial and label issues slowed the collective's recorded output in the 1980s while Clinton and other members began solo careers, with Clinton also consolidating the collective's multiple projects and touring under names such as '''George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars'''. In the 1990s, their sound became the chief inspiration for the [[West Coast hip hop]] subgenre [[G-funk]].\n\nProminent collective members have included bassist [[Bootsy Collins]] (who formed the spinoff group Bootsy's Rubber Band), keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], guitarists [[Eddie Hazel|Eddie \"Maggot Brain\" Hazel]], [[Michael Hampton]], and [[Garry Shider|Garry \"Diaper Man\" Shider]], and horn players [[Fred Wesley]] and [[Maceo Parker]]. Some former members of Parliament perform under the name \"[[Original P]]\". Sixteen members of Parliament-Funkadelic were inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997. In 2019, the group was given the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].",
