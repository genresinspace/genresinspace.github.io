The name originated from a [[spoonerism]] on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] which became \"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\".\n\nAlthough Horslips had limited commercial success when the band was playing in the 1970s, there was a revival of interest in their music in the late 1990s and they came to be regarded as one of the defining bands of the Celtic rock genre. The band resumed activity between 2004 and 2012, playing a small number of shows and producing releases, both live and studio. They played their final shows in August of 2012.",
