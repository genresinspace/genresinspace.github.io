  "description": "'''The Oak Ridge Boys''' are an American vocal quartet. The classic and most well-known lineup of the group, which performed together for over 40 years, consisted of [[William Lee Golden]] (baritone), [[Duane Allen]] (lead), [[Richard Sterban]] (bass), and [[Joe Bonsall]] (tenor). \n\nBonsall sang with the group until mid-December of 2023.  On December 30th of that year, Ben James debuted as the Oak Ridge Boys' tenor at a show in [[Biloxi]], completing the group in its present form.\n\nThe act was founded in 1943 as the [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] act '''Wally Fowler and the Georgia Clodhoppers''', but were soon known as '''The Oak Ridge Quartet'''. They became popular in [[Southern gospel]] in the 1950s and their name was changed to '''Oak Ridge Boys''' in the 1960s. They transitioned from traditional southern gospel to contemporary gospel before going into popular music in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe lineup that produced their most well-known hits ― such as \"[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]\", \"[[Bobbie Sue (song)|Bobbie Sue]]\", and \"[[American Made (song)|American Made]]\" ― was made up of Allen, Bonsall, Golden, and Sterban. Golden and Allen joined in the mid-1960s, and Sterban and Bonsall in the early 1970s. After years of acrimony, Golden was dismissed in 1987 and [[Steve Sanders (musician)|Steve Sanders]] took over until quitting the act in 1995; Golden was rehired at the end of that year.",
