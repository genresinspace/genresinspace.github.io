  "description": "'''Pussy Riot''' is a [[Feminism in Russia|Russian feminist]] protest and [[performance art]] group based in [[Moscow]] that became popular for its provocative [[punk rock]] music which later turned into a more accessible style. Founded in the fall of 2011 by the then 22-year-old [[Nadya Tolokonnikova]], it has had a membership of approximately 11 women. The group staged unauthorized, provocative [[guerrilla gig]]s in public places. These performances were filmed as music videos and posted on the internet. The group's lyrical themes included feminism, [[LGBTQ rights in Russia|LGBTQ rights]], opposition to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Putinism|his policies]] and his links to the leadership of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe group gained global notoriety when five members of [[#2012 arrests, trial and imprisonment|the group staged a performance]] inside Moscow's [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in February 2012, an action condemned as [[sacrilegious]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Three members of the group were arrested, tried, convicted, later amnestied and released on probation. The trial and sentence attracted considerable attention and criticism, particularly in [[Western world|the West]]. The case was taken up by [[human rights group]]s, including [[Amnesty International]], which designated the women as [[prisoners of conscience]], and by a number of prominent entertainers. Public opinion in Russia was generally less sympathetic towards the band members.\n\nIn December 2025, the [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Justice]] added Pussy Riot to its list of [[List of organizations designated as terrorist or extremist by Russia|extremist organizations]].",
