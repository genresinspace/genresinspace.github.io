  "name": "Pussy Riot",
  "description": "'''Pussy Riot''' is a [[Feminism in Russia|Russian feminist]] protest and [[performance art]] group based in [[Moscow]] that became popular for its provocative [[punk rock]] music which later turned into a more accessible style. Founded in the fall of 2011 by the then 22-year-old [[Nadya Tolokonnikova]], it has had a membership of approximately 11 women. The group staged unauthorized, provocative [[guerrilla gig]]s in public places. These performances were filmed as music videos and posted on the internet. The group's lyrical themes included feminism, [[LGBTQ rights in Russia|LGBTQ rights]], opposition to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Putinism|his policies]], and Putin's links to the leadership of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nThe group gained global notoriety when five members of [[#2012 arrests, trial and imprisonment|the group staged a performance]] inside Moscow's [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in February 2012, an action condemned as [[sacrilegious]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Three members of the group were arrested, tried, convicted, later amnestied and released on probation. The trial and sentence attracted considerable attention and criticism, particularly in [[Western world|the West]]. The case was taken up by [[human rights group]]s, including [[Amnesty International]], which designated the women as [[prisoners of conscience]], and by a number of prominent entertainers. Public opinion in Russia was generally less sympathetic towards the band members.\n\nIn February 2014, a statement was made anonymously on behalf of some Pussy Riot members that Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova were no longer members. However, both were among the group that performed as Pussy Riot during the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics in Sochi]], where group members were attacked with whips and [[pepper spray]] by the [[Registered Cossacks of the Russian Federation|Russian Cossack paramilitary]] employed as security guards.",
