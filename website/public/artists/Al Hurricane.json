  "name": "Al Hurricane",
  "description": "'''Alberto Nelson Sanchez''' (July 10, 1936 â€“ October 22, 2017), known professionally as '''Al Hurricane''', was an American singer-songwriter, dubbed \"The Godfather\" of [[New Mexico music]]. He released more than thirty albums, and is best known for his contributions to [[New Mexico]]'s unique style of Spanish music.\n\nHe received his nickname, Hurricane, from his mother. As a child, he would accidentally knock things over; the nickname became synonymous with his band, studio, and a recording label. His signature look, which included an eye-patch, was due to an automobile accident that occurred during the 1960s. These things, as well as his performance style, led to Hurricane being known for his ability to improvise and adapt. They have also led to his music and image being ultimately entangled with the history of New Mexico music.\n\nDuring his career he also performed alongside [[Chuck Berry]], [[Chubby Checker]], [[Jimmy Clanton]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Marvin Gaye]], along with other [[country music]] and [[rock and roll]] musicians.",
