  "description": "'''Orquesta Aragón''' is a Cuban musical band formed on 30 September 1939, by Orestes Aragón Cantero in [[Cienfuegos, Cuba]]. The band originally had the name ''Ritmica 39'', then ''Ritmica Aragón'' before settling on its final form. Though they did not create the ''Cha-cha-cha'', they were arguably the best [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] in Cuba during the 1950s and 1960s. Their trade-marks included high-class instrumentalists playing in tight ensemble style, and rhythmical innovations which kept their sound up to date. Over the years they progressed from their start as a danzoneria to play a wider variety of styles, [[danzón]], then cha-cha-cha, then onda-cha, [[pachanga]] and [[Son (music)|son]] fusions. They still perform today, based in Havana.",
