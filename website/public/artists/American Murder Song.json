  "description": "'''American Murder Song''' (sometimes abbreviated AMS) is an American musical act founded in 2016 by [[cult film]] composers and performers [[Terrance Zdunich]] and Saar Hendelman. The project uses the [[murder ballad]] genre to explore [[American history]], especially 19th-century America.\n\nIn American Murder Song, Saar and Terrance play the role of roguish balladeers Mister Storm and Mister Tender who make a pact with the Bible's [[Cain]] to chronicle the tales of killers, known as Survivors, who bear The Mark, an American [[Mark of Cain]].\n\nBy way of live shows, music videos and albums, American Murder Song has so far explored 1816, also known as \"[[The Year Without a Summer]]\", [[The Donner Party]]'s deadly journey of 1846 and \"The Killing Place\", a metaphoric house of Cain where all murder ballads reside.",
