  "description": "'''Godflesh''' are an English [[industrial metal]] band from [[Birmingham]], formed in 1988 by [[Justin Broadrick]] (guitar, vocals, programming) and [[B. C. Green]] (bass, programming). Before forming Godflesh, the pair worked together in Fall of Because, a band that began in 1982 as O.P.D. and helped lay the groundwork for Godflesh’s formation. Through their fusion of [[hip hop]]–derived [[drum machine|drum programming]], [[heavy metal music|metal]] riffs, and [[industrial music|industrial]] dissonance, later exploring [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[dub music|dub]] elements, Godflesh developed a sound widely recognized as foundational to industrial metal and [[post-metal]], and influential across [[experimental metal|experimental]] and [[extreme metal]].{{efn|name=note1}}\n\nThe band signed to [[Earache Records]] in the late 1980s and released their debut album ''[[Streetcleaner]]'' (1989) to contemporary and lasting acclaim. After the release of their sophomore album ''[[Pure (Godflesh album)|Pure]]'' (1992) and their major label debut ''[[Selfless (album)|Selfless]]'' (1994), they started experimenting with live drums as well as hip hop and [[breakbeat]] sounds. The resulting albums, ''[[Songs of Love and Hate (Godflesh album)|Songs of Love and Hate]]'' (1996) and ''[[Us and Them (Godflesh album)|Us and Them]]'' (1999), were followed by ''[[Hymns (Godflesh album)|Hymns]]'' (2001), which saw a simplification of the band's style. Shortly after Green's departure in 2002, Broadrick ended Godflesh and pursued various other projects, such as [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]]. Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2009, releasing ''[[A World Lit Only by Fire (album)|A World Lit Only by Fire]]'' (2014) and ''[[Post Self]]'' (2017) to critical acclaim. Their ninth album, ''[[Purge (Godflesh album)|Purge]]'', was released in June 2023.\n\nAs pioneers of industrial metal, Godflesh's early sound was defined by harsh machine beats, production-emphasised bass, distorted guitar and sparse vocals delivered in a low, guttural fashion. The band performed for most of their career as a duo with Broadrick and Green playing over preprogrammed percussion, normally to a backdrop of apocalyptic scenery and [[Christian iconography]]. Godflesh's music has been regarded as especially heavy and grim, with ''Streetcleaner'' being named by several publications as one of the heaviest and greatest metal albums.{{efn|name=note4}}",
