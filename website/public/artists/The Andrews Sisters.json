  "description": "'''The Andrews Sisters''' were an American [[close harmony]] singing group of the [[Swing music|swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]] eras. The group consisted of three sisters: [[contralto]] '''LaVerne Sophia Andrews''' (1911–1967), [[soprano]] '''Maxene Anglyn Andrews''' (1916–1995), and [[mezzo-soprano]] '''Patricia Marie Andrews''' (1918–2013). The sisters have sold an estimated 80 million records. Their 1941 hit \"[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]\" can be considered an early example of [[jump blues]]. Other songs closely associated with the Andrews Sisters include their first major hit, \"[[Bei Mir Bistu Shein|Bei Mir Bist Du Schön (Means That You're Grand)]]\" (1937), \"[[Beer Barrel Polka]] (Roll Out the Barrel)\" (1939), \"[[Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar]]\" (1940), \"[[Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (with Anyone Else but Me)]]\" (1942), and \"[[Rum and Coca-Cola]]\" (1945), which helped introduce American audiences to [[calypso music|calypso]].\n\nThe Andrews Sisters' harmonies and songs are still influential today and have been copied and recorded by entertainers such as [[Patti Page]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Pentatonix]], and others. The group was among the inaugural inductees to the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] upon its opening in 1998. Writing for ''Bloomberg'', Mark Schoifet said the sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century. They are still widely acclaimed today for their famous close harmonies. They were inducted into the Minnesota Rock/Country Hall of Fame in May 2006.",
