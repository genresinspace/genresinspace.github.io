Tinariwen first started to gain a following outside the Sahara region in 2001 with the release of the album ''[[The Radio Tisdas Sessions]].'' Their most recent album ''[[Amatssou]]'' was released in 2023.\n\nThe group has been nominated for [[Grammy Awards]] three times, and their 2012 album ''[[Tassili (album)|Tassili]]'' won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album|Best World Music Album]] in 2012. [[NPR]] calls the group \"music's true rebels\", [[AllMusic]] deems the group's music \"a grassroots voice of rebellion\", and ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' calls the group \"rock 'n' roll rebels whose rebellion, for once, wasn't just metaphorical\".",
