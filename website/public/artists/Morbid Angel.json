  "description": "'''Morbid Angel''' is an American [[death metal]] band based in [[Tampa, Florida]], formed in 1983 by guitarist, primary composer and sole remaining original member Trey Azagthoth, vocalist and bassist Dallas Ward, and drummer [[Mike Browning]]. It was one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo [[blast beat]]s, multiple tempo changes and a dark atmosphere. Morbid Angel was also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1992, heavy rotation of its music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \"God of Emptiness\" shown on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. The band's first three albums – ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' (1989), ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'' (1991), and ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'' (1993) – are considered classics in the death metal genre.\n\nBritish music magazine ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' ranked ''Altars of Madness'' first in its list \"Top 40 greatest death metal albums\". ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' magazine also rated guitarist Trey Azagthoth as the number one \"death metal guitarist ever\". The band's songs are complex in arrangement; this owes much to the considerable technical skills of both Azagthoth and drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], the latter of whom also played in the [[grindcore]] band [[Terrorizer]]. According to [[Luminate (company)|Nielsen SoundScan]], Morbid Angel's third album ''Covenant'' is the best-selling death metal album of the Soundscan era with over 150,000 units sold, and the band is the third-best-selling death metal act in the United States (after [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]] up until 2003 with sales of over 445,000). In 2016, the staff of ''[[Loudwire]]'' named them the 27th best metal band of all time.\n\nThe band's original lyrical themes, when helmed by Vincent (and Azagthoth and Browning respectively) focused mostly on [[Satanism]], [[occultism]] and [[blasphemous]] subject matter, but from ''[[Formulas Fatal to the Flesh]]'' (1998) onward, via Azagthoth's influence, the lyrics moved toward the ancient [[Mesopotamian mythology|Sumerian gods]]. Much of this is a nod to the [[Simon Necronomicon]], which was influenced by Sumerian mythology, the author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and fascination with the [[Roman Empire]], and during Steve Tucker's tenure they take on more [[anti-religious]] and barbaric themes, namely of the strong overcoming the weak.",
