  "description": "'''The Replacements''' were an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], in 1979. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist [[Paul Westerberg]], guitarist [[Bob Stinson]], bass guitarist [[Tommy Stinson]], and drummer [[Chris Mars]] for most of its existence. After two albums in the style of [[punk rock]], they became one of the main pioneers of [[alternative rock]] with their acclaimed albums ''[[Let It Be (The Replacements album)|Let It Be]]'' and ''[[Tim (The Replacements album)|Tim]]''. Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and [[Slim Dunlap]] joined as lead guitarist. [[Steve Foley (drummer)|Steve Foley]] replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over its creative output. The group disbanded in 1991 and the members found various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012. Fans affectionately refer to the band as the 'Mats, a nickname which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats\".\n\nThe Replacements' music was influenced by [[Rock music|rock]] artists such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Beatles]], [[Faces (band)|Faces]], [[Big Star]], [[Slade]], [[Badfinger]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], and [[Bob Dylan]] as well as [[punk rock]] bands including the [[Ramones]], the [[New York Dolls]], the [[Buzzcocks]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and the [[Sex Pistols]]. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\" rock songs which combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\" with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.",
