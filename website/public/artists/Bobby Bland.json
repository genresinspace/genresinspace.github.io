  "description": "'''Robert Calvin Bland''' (born '''Robert Calvin Brooks'''; January 27, 1930&nbsp;â€“ June 23, 2013), known professionally as '''Bobby \"Blue\" Bland''', was an American [[blues]] singer. Bland developed a sound that mixed [[Gospel music|gospel]] with the [[blues]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]. He was described as \"among the great storytellers of blues and soul music... [who] created tempestuous arias of love, betrayal and resignation, set against roiling, dramatic orchestrations, and left the listener drained but awed.\" The inspiration behind his unique style was a Detroit Preacher, CL Franklin, because Bland studied his sermons. He was sometimes referred to as the \"Lion of the Blues\" and as the \"[[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]] of the Blues\". His music was influenced by [[Nat King Cole]].\n\nBland was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1981, the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1992, and the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] in 2012. He received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1997. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame described him as \"second in stature only to [[B.B. King]] as a product of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]'s [[Beale Street]] blues scene\". In 2023, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Bland at number 163 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.",
