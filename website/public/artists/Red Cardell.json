  "name": "Red Cardell",
  "description": "'''Red Cardell''' is a French, [[Breton people|Breton]] [[Rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]], that mixes [[Music of Brittany|Breton music]] with rock, folk, blues, world music and [[chanson réaliste]].\n\nThe group was formed in 1992 by Jean-Pierre Riou (vocals, guitars), Jean-Michel Moal (accordion) and Ian Proërer (drums). With the departure of the latter in 2001, Manu Masko became the drummer.  He left in 2015.\n\nIn 2011, the band added Mathieu Péquériau (harmonica, washboard) as a new member, some months before Jean-Michel Moal had to take a break from the group due to health problems. He returned in 2015.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, the band was joined on stage by two additional musicians : Ronan Le Bars (bagpipes, whistles), ([[Dan Ar Braz]] / [[Héritage des Celtes]]) and Pierre Stéphan (fiddle), and had a joint show with [[Bagad Kemper]]. During that same time period,  the five band members were involved in [[The Celtic Social Club]], alongside [[Jimme O'Neill]], leader of ([[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]]) and bassman Richard Puaud.\n\nIn December 2015, Jean-Pierre Riou and Jean-Michel Moal, the 1992 co-founders of the group, joined forces again after four years of separation. In this new collective, they are accompanied by the multi-instrumentalist Pierre Sangra, partner of the band since the album ''Naître'', and drummer Hibu Corbel.\n\nThey are considered by music critics to be one of the best Breton bands of this time, in the footsteps of [[Alan Stivell]] and [[Dan Ar Braz]], precursors of the Celtic wave of the 1970s, having learned to combine rock and contemporary music with traditional music.",
