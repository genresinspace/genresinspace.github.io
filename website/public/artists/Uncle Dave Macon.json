  "description": "'''David Harrison Macon''' (October 7, 1870 – March 22, 1952), known professionally as '''Uncle Dave Macon''', was an American [[old-time music|old-time]] [[banjo|banjo player]], [[singing|singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[comedian]].  Known as \"The Dixie Dewdrop\", Macon was known for his chin whiskers, [[plug hat]], gold teeth, and gates-ajar collar; he gained regional fame as a [[vaudeville]] performer in the early 1920s before becoming the first star of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in the latter half of the decade.\n\nMacon's music is considered the ultimate bridge between 19th-century American folk and vaudeville music and the phonograph and radio-based music of the early 20th-century. Music historian Charles Wolfe wrote, \"If people call yodelling [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] 'the father of country music,' then Uncle Dave must certainly be 'the grandfather of country music'.\" Macon's polished stage presence and lively personality have made him one of the most enduring figures of early [[country music]].",
