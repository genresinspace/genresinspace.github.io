  "name": "Fairyland",
  "description": "'''Fairyland''' is a French [[symphonic power metal]] band, created by songwriters Philippe Giordana and Willdric Lievin in 1998.\n\nAfter going through several line-up changes in the 2000s, the band turned into a one-man musical project, when Giordana parted ways with the rest of the band in 2007. He subsequently released ''Score to a New Beginning'' in 2009 as Fairyland, with guest musicians and singers. In 2015 however, Fairyland became a band once again with a full line-up, including Lievin, returning for the first time since 2004.",
