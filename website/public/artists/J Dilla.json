  "description": "'''James Dewitt Yancey''' (born February 7, 1974 – February 10, 2006), better known by the stage names '''J Dilla''' and '''Jay Dee''', was an American record producer, rapper, and composer. He emerged from the mid-1990s [[underground hip hop]] scene in [[Detroit]], Michigan, as a member of the group [[Slum Village]]. He was also a founding member of the [[Soulquarians]], a musical collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s. He and [[Madlib]] collaborated as the duo Jaylib, releasing the album ''[[Champion Sound]]''. Yancey's final album was ''[[Donuts (album)|Donuts]]'', which was released three days before his death. He was also known for producing [[The Pharcyde]] album ''[[Labcabincalifornia]]''.\n\nYancey died at the age of 32 from a combination of [[Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|TTP]] and [[lupus]]. Although his life was short, he is considered to be one of the most influential producers in hip hop and popular music. J Dilla's music raised the artistic level of [[hip-hop production]] in Detroit. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', \"His affinity for crafting lengthy, melodic loops peppered with breakbeats and vocal samples took instrumental hip-hop into new, more musically complex realms.\" In particular, his approach to [[drum programming]], with its loose, or \"drunk\", style that eschews the use of [[Quantization (music)|quantization]], has been influential on producers and drummers.",
