Although his life was short, he is considered to be one of the most influential producers in hip hop and popular music. J Dilla's music raised the artistic level of [[hip-hop production]] in Detroit. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', \"His affinity for crafting lengthy, melodic loops peppered with breakbeats and vocal samples took instrumental hip-hop into new, more musically complex realms.\" In particular, his approach to [[drum programming]], with its loose, or \"drunk\" style that eschews the use of [[Quantization (music)|quantization]], has been influential on producers and drummers.",
