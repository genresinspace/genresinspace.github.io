  "description": "'''The High Llamas''' are an Anglo-Irish [[chamber pop]] band formed in [[London]] circa 1991. They were founded by singer-songwriter [[Sean O'Hagan]], formerly of [[Microdisney]], with drummer Rob Allum and ex-Microdisney bassist Jon Fell. O'Hagan has led the group since its formation. Their music is often compared to [[the Beach Boys]], a band he acknowledges as an influence, although more prominent influences were drawn from [[bossa nova]] and European film soundtracks.\n\nO'Hagan formed the High Llamas after the breakup of his group Microdisney. The band initially played in a more conventional acoustic [[indie pop]] style, but after he joined [[Stereolab]] as a keyboardist, he was inspired to revamp the High Llamas' style closer to the [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[orchestral]] sound he preferred. Their second album, ''[[Gideon Gaye]]'' (1994), anticipated the mid 1990s [[easy-listening]] revivalist movement, and its follow-up ''[[Hawaii (The High Llamas album)|Hawaii]]'' (1996) nearly led to a collaboration with the Beach Boys.",
