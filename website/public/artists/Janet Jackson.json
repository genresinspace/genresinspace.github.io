  "name": "Janet Jackson",
  "description": "'''Janet Damita Jo Jackson''' (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of [[MTV]], enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking [[Gender inequality in the United States|gender]] and [[Racism against Black Americans|racial]] barriers in the process. Lyrical content that focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.\n\nThe tenth and youngest child of the [[Jackson family]], Jackson began her career as a [[child actress]], with roles in the television series ''[[Good Times]]'' (1977–1979), ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1980–1984), and ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'' (1984–1985). She signed a recording contract with [[A&M Records]] in 1982 and became a [[pop icon]] following the releases of the albums ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986) and ''[[Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814|Rhythm Nation 1814]]'' (1989). Her collaborations with record producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] incorporated a variety of music genres, which led to crossover success in [[popular music]] and influenced the development of the [[new jack swing]] fusion genre. In the 1990s, Jackson became one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, signing two [[List of largest music deals|record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts]] with [[Virgin Records]]. She established her image as a [[sex symbol]] with a leading role in the film ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993), and the albums ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' (1997). ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her the second most successful artist of the decade in the United States.\n\nThe release of her seventh studio album ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]'' in 2001 coincided with Jackson being the subject of the first ''[[MTV Icon]]'' special. By the end of the year, she joined her brother [[Michael Jackson|Michael]] as one of the few artists to score [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one songs|ten number-one singles]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, the backlash from the 2004 [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]] resulted in an industry [[blacklist]]ing under the direction of [[Les Moonves]], then-CEO of [[CBS]]. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album ''[[Discipline (Janet Jackson album)|Discipline]]'' (2008), her only album with [[Island Records]]. In 2015, she partnered with [[BMG Rights Management]] to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation. Jackson has continued to release music and perform, with the [[Janet Jackson: Together Again|Together Again Tour]] (2023–2024) earning $100 million and becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of her career.\n\nJackson has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. She holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100  by a female artist (18) and remains the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven singles from one album (''Rhythm Nation 1814'') peak within the top five positions. In 2008, ''Billboard'' placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the \"Top 50 R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". In 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist. [[List of awards and nominations received by Janet Jackson|Her accolades]] include five [[Grammy Awards]], eleven [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], eleven [[American Music Awards]], a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and eight ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' entries.
