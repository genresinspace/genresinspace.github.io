  "description": "'''Yeah Yeah Yeahs''' are an American [[indie rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 2000. The group consists of [[Karen O]] (vocals, piano), [[Nick Zinner]] (guitars, keyboards), and [[Brian Chase]] (drums); they do not have a bassist but are complemented in live shows by [[David Pajo]] and, previously, [[Imaad Wasif]]. Described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"the best thing to happen to [[punk rock]]\", the band is known for energetic performances and a blend of genres, including [[art rock]] and [[dance-rock]].\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs began performing as a supporting act in the early 2000s, releasing a [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs (EP)|self-titled EP]] in the interim. Their mainstream breakthrough came with their debut album, ''[[Fever to Tell]]'' (2003), which earned widespread acclaim and strong sales. It produced four singles, including \"[[Maps (Yeah Yeah Yeahs song)|Maps]]\", which became one of the band's most [[List of signature songs|recognizable songs]]. They issued a second album, ''[[Show Your Bones]]'' (2006), and shifted to [[dance-punk]] with their third, ''[[It's Blitz!]]'', in 2009. Both records received positive reviews, and the latter spawned the hit single \"[[Heads Will Roll (song)|Heads Will Roll]]\". The band's fourth album, ''[[Mosquito (album)|Mosquito]]'' (2013), became their highest-charting record in the US but did not match the reception of its predecessors. The group went on a hiatus the following year and returned in 2017, performing live for the rest of the 2010s. Their fifth album, ''[[Cool It Down]]'' (2022), was released to critical acclaim. It produced three singles, including the digital hit \"[[Spitting Off the Edge of the World]]\".\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs have received several accolades, including nominations for five [[Grammy Awards]]—four of which were for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]]—and seven [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. ''Rolling Stone'' included ''Fever to Tell'' on their list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\" and \"Maps\" on their \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\".",
