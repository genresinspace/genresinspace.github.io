  "description": "'''Shankar–Jaikishan''' (also known as '''S-J''') were an Indian composer duo of the [[Hindi film industry]], working together from 1949 to 1971. They are widely considered to be one of the greatest music composers of the Hindi film industry. \n\nAfter Jaikishan's death in 1971, Shankar continued as a music director alone until his own death in 1987. During this solo career, he was still credited as 'Shankar–Jaikishan'. Shankar–Jaikishan, along with other artists, composed \"everlasting\" and \"immortal melodies\" in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Their best work was noted for being \"raga-based and having both lilt and sonority\".",
