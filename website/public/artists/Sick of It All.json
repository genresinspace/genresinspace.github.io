  "description": "'''Sick of It All''' is an American [[hardcore punk]] band formed in 1986 in [[Queens]], New York City. The band's lineup consists of brothers Lou and Pete Koller on lead vocals and guitars respectively, Armand Majidi on drums, and [[Craig Setari]] on bass. Sick of It All is considered a major part of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, and by 2020, the band had sold at least half a million records worldwide.\n\nThough their 1989 debut album ''[[Blood, Sweat and No Tears]]'' was a moderate success, Sick of It All did not achieve commercial success until later albums. After the release of their second album ''[[Just Look Around]]'' in 1992, [[East West Records]] saw the band's potential and signed them in 1993. Sick of It All's third and major label debut album, ''[[Scratch the Surface]]'', was released in 1994 to critical acclaim and included the singles \"Scratch the Surface\" and \"Step Down\".  They released one more album on East West, 1997's ''[[Built to Last (Sick of It All album)|Built to Last]]'', before signing with [[Fat Wreck Chords]] in 1998, which released the band's next three studio albums. They signed to Abacus Records afterwards, a subsidiary of [[Century Media Records|Century Media]]. This label released their eighth studio album ''[[Death to Tyrants]]'' in 2006 to positive reviews (Abacus eventually went out of business, though Sick of It All would remain on Century Media, which released the band's next three albums). Sick of It All's latest album, ''[[Wake the Sleeping Dragon!]]'', was released in 2018.",
