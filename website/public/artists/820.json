  "description": "'''Underdark''' are a British [[black metal]] band from [[Nottingham]], England, formed in 2015 by guitarists Ollie Jones and Adam Kinson and former drummer Dan Hallam. Their current lineup consists of Jones, Kinson, bassist Neil Sutherland, vocalist Abi Vasquez and drummer Dan Blackmore. The band's sound has been categorized under the \"[[post-black metal]]\" label and incorporates elements of [[blackgaze]], [[screamo]], and [[post-hardcore]]. Its members' [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] beliefs, held since the band's inception, have led to Underdark being associated with the \"anti-fascist black metal\" and Red and Anarchist Black Metal (RABM) movements, although they do not consider themselves to be a political band.\n\nUnderdark released their debut [[extended play]], ''Mourning Cloak'' (2016), with original vocalist Max Speelman. Speelman quit the band and was replaced by Vasquez in 2019, shortly after the recording of its debut album, ''Our Bodies Burned Bright on Re-Entry'' (2021). Their second album, ''Managed Decline'', was released through [[Church Road Records]] on 24 November 2023.",
