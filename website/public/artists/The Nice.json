The group's stage performances featured Emerson's [[Hammond organ]] showmanship and abuse of the instrument. Their compositions included radical rearrangements of classical music themes and [[Bob Dylan]] songs.\n\nThe band achieved commercial success with an instrumental rearrangement of [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s \"[[America (West Side Story song)|America]]\", following which O'List left the group. The remaining members carried on as a trio, releasing several albums, before Emerson left the band in early 1970 in order to form [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]].
