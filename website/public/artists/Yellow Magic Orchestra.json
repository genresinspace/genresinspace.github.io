  "description": "'''Yellow Magic Orchestra''' (abbreviated to '''YMO''') was a Japanese [[electronic music]] band formed in Tokyo in 1978 by [[Haruomi Hosono]] (bass, keyboards, vocals), [[Yukihiro Takahashi]] (drums, lead vocals, occasional keyboards) and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] (keyboards, vocals). The group is considered influential and innovative in the field of popular electronic music. They were pioneers in their use of [[synthesizers]], [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[music sequencer|sequencers]], [[drum machine]]s, [[Computer music|computers]], and [[Digital audio|digital recording]] technology, and effectively anticipated the \"[[electropop]] boom\" of the 1980s. They are credited with influencing the development of various electronic genres, including [[synth-pop]], [[city pop]], [[Electronic dance music|dance]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[hip-hop]], [[J-pop]] and [[techno]]. They also explored subversive socio-political themes throughout their career.\n\nThe three members were veterans of the [[music industry]] before coming together as YMO, and were inspired by eclectic sources, including the electronic music of [[Isao Tomita]] and [[Kraftwerk]], [[Music of Japan|Japanese traditional music]], [[arcade game]]s, [[funk]] music, and the [[disco]] productions of [[Giorgio Moroder]]. They released the surprise global hit \"[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game]]\" in 1978, reaching the UK Top 20 and selling 400,000 copies in the U.S. For their early recordings and performances, the band was often accompanied by programmer [[Hideki Matsutake]]. The group released several albums before pausing their activity in 1984. They briefly reunited several times in subsequent decades before Takahashi and Sakamoto's deaths in 2023.",
