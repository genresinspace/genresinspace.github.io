  "description": "'''Green Day''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Rodeo, California]], in 1987, by the lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] and the bassist and backing vocalist [[Mike Dirnt]], with the drummer [[Tré Cool]] joining in 1990. In 1994, their major-label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 20 million copies in the U.S. Green Day has been credited with reigniting mainstream interest in [[punk rock]].\n\nBefore taking its current name in 1989, the band was named '''Sweet Children'''. They were part of the [[Punk rock in California|late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene]] that emerged from [[924 Gilman Street]], a club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]], including their first album ''[[39/Smooth]]'' (1990). For most of the band's career, they have been a [[power trio]] with Cool, who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990, before the recording of the band's second studio album ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Though the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful, with ''Insomniac'' and ''Nimrod'' reaching double platinum status, while ''Warning'' achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation and sold six million copies in the U.S. Their next album ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'' was released in 2009. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[¡Uno!]]'', ''[[¡Dos!]]'', and ''[[¡Tré!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not commercially perform as well as expected, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to a lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. These albums were followed by ''[[Revolution Radio]]'' (2016), which became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|'' Billboard'' 200]], ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'' (2020), and ''[[Saviors (album)|Saviors]]'' (2024).\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]]: [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]], and [[Tony Award for Best Lighting Design|Best Lighting Design]], winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects [[Pinhead Gunpowder]], [[the Network]], [[Foxboro Hot Tubs]], [[The Longshot (band)|the Longshot]], and [[the Coverups]]. They have also worked on solo careers.\n\nGreen Day has sold roughly 75 million records worldwide as of 2024, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]. The group has been nominated for 20 [[Grammy Awards]] and won five: [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''Dookie'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.",
