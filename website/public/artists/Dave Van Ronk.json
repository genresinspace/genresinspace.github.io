An important figure in the [[American folk music revival]] and [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] scene in the 1960s, he was nicknamed the \"Mayor of [[MacDougal Street]]\".\n\nVan Ronk's work ranged from old English ballads to [[blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]], and [[swing (genre)|swing]]. He was also known for performing instrumental [[ragtime]] guitar music, especially his transcription of \"St. Louis Tickle\" and [[Scott Joplin]]'s \"[[Maple Leaf Rag]]\". Van Ronk was a widely admired avuncular figure in the Village, presiding over the coffeehouse folk culture and acting as a friend to many up-and-coming artists by inspiring, assisting, and promoting them. Folk performers he befriended include [[Jim and Jean]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Patrick Sky]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Dylan recorded Van Ronk's arrangement of the traditional song \"[[House of the Rising Sun]]\" on his first album which [[The Animals]] would later cover and which would become a chart-topping rock single for them in 1964, helping inaugurate the [[folk rock]] movement.\n\nVan Ronk received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ([[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]) in December 1997.",
