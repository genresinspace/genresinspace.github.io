  "description": "'''Hernán Enrique Jiménez Pino''' (born May 7, 1983), is a Panamanian singer better known by his stage name '''Makano'''. At the age of 12, Jiménez was part of a [[reggaeton]] group called \"Los Makanos\". The members of the group made a promise that the first of them to record a full album would carry on the group's name. Makano in Panama and Colombia means \"strong like a tree\".\n\nWhen he was 16, Jiménez was writing quality music, but his father discouraged him from music, saying he needed to get a real job. After several years of trying, an opportunity appeared and Jimenez appeared on the CD ''La Alianza'' in 2004. Afterward, he was given the chance to record several songs, which later became number one hits in Panama. In 2007, Jimenez signed with Panama Music and recorded his first album as a solo singer: ''[[Te Amo (album)|Te Amo Rosemary]]'', which features the songs \"Yo Quisiera Vivir\", \"Te Va a Doler\", \"[[Te Amo (Makano song)|Te Amo]]\" and \"Déjame Entrar\".\n\nIn the week of May 23 and May 30, 2009, ''Te Amo'' was number 1 on [[List of number-one Billboard Hot Latin Songs of 2009|Billboard Hot Latin Songs]].",
