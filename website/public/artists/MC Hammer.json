  "description": "'''Stanley Kirk Burrell''' (born March 30, 1962), better known by his stage name '''MC Hammer''' (or simply '''Hammer'''), is an American [[rapping|rapper]] and dancer, known for hit songs such as \"[[U Can't Touch This]]\", \"[[2 Legit 2 Quit]]\" and \"[[Pumps and a Bump]]\", flashy dance movements, extravagant [[choreography]], and his namesake [[Hammer pants]]. Remembered for a rapid rise to fame, Hammer has also been an [[entrepreneur]] and celebrity [[spokesperson]]. A multi-award winner, he is considered a \"forefather\" and pioneering innovator of [[pop rap]] (incorporating elements of [[Electronic dance music#Hip hop|freestyle music]]).\n\nBorn and raised in [[Oakland, California]], Hammer served three years in the [[United States Navy]] before independently releasing his debut album ''[[Feel My Power]]'' in 1986. After signing a contract with [[Capitol Records]], Hammer released his second album ''[[Let's Get It Started (album)|Let's Get It Started]]'' in 1988, which became his first multi-platinum hit. Hammer became the first hip hop artist to achieve [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|diamond status]] with his next album ''[[Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em]]'' (1990), helping him become one of the most prominent media celebrities of the early 1990s. After being labeled a [[sellout]] by the changing landscape of [[hip hop music]] which led to declining record sales for his fourth album, ''[[Too Legit To Quit]]'' (1991), Hammer unsuccessfully attempted to appeal to the rise of [[gangsta rap]] with his next album, ''[[The Funky Headhunter]]'' (1994). However, due to commercial overexposure, Hammer's popularity waned by the mid-1990s, which led to a [[MC Hammer#Bankruptcy, lawsuits, and media reaction|highly publicized bankruptcy]] beginning in 1996. He has since released [[MC Hammer#Discography|seven more albums]], in addition to [[MC Hammer#Most recent releases (2010–present)|multiple songs after 2010]].\n\nAlong with a [[Mattel]] doll and other merchandise, Hammer starred in a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] called ''[[Hammerman]]'' in 1991. He became an [[ordained]] [[preacher]] during the late 1990s and hosted ''MC Hammer and Friends'', a [[Christian ministry]] program on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]]. Hammer was also a dance judge on ''[[Dance Fever (2003 TV series)|Dance Fever]]'' in 2003, was the co-creator of the dance website DanceJam.com, and was executive producer of his own [[Docu-soap|reality show]] titled ''[[Hammertime]]'' (which aired on the [[A&E Network]] during the summer of 2009).\n\nThroughout his career, Hammer has managed his own recording business as a record label CEO. As a result, Hammer has created and produced his own acts/music including Ho Frat Hoo!, [[Oaktown's 3.5.7]], [[Special Generation (band)|Special Generation]], [[Mikalah Gordon|Analise]], [[DRS (group)|DRS]], [[B Angie B]], Gentry Kozia and [[#\"Raider Nation\" and \"All in My Mind\" (2013–2014)|Oakland Fight Club]]. A part of additional record labels, he has associated, collaborated and recorded with [[Psy]], VMF, [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Teddy Riley]], [[Felton Pilate]], [[Tha Dogg Pound]], [[The Funky Headhunter#Production|The Whole 9]], The Hines Brother, [[Deion Sanders]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[BeBe & CeCe Winans]] and [[Jon Gibson (Christian musician)|Jon Gibson]]. Hammer signed with [[Suge Knight]]'s [[Death Row Records#MC Hammer's involvement and departure|Death Row Records]] in 1995.\n\n[[BET]] ranked Hammer as the No. 7 \"Best Dancer of All Time\". ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]''{{'}}s \"The Best Rapper Ever Tournament\" declared him the 17th favorite of all-time during the first round. He continues to perform concerts at music venues and appears in [[television advertisement]]s,  along with participating in social media and ministry/outreach functions. Hammer is also active in community and sports activities, being interviewed locally and nationally.",
