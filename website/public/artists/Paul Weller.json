  "name": "Paul Weller",
  "description": "'''John William Weller''' (born 25 May 1958), better known as '''Paul Weller''', is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Weller achieved fame in the late 1970s as the guitarist and principal singer and songwriter of the rock band [[the Jam]], alongside [[Bruce Foxton]] and [[Rick Buckler]]. The band gained significant critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom, and were the most influential band of the [[mod revival]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following the dissolution of the Jam at the end of 1982, Weller formed [[the Style Council]] with [[Mick Talbot]], where he explored a wide variety of other musical styles, including pop, jazz, soul, hip hop, folk and classical. Although initially successful, the band's popularity declined in the late 1980s, leading them to break up in 1989. Weller began a solo career in the early 1990s, slowly re-establishing his commercial standing across his first four solo albums, ''[[Paul Weller (album)|Paul Weller]]'' (1992), ''[[Wild Wood]]'' (1993), ''[[Stanley Road]]'' (1995) and ''[[Heavy Soul (Paul Weller album)|Heavy Soul]]'' (1997).\n\nAlthough Weller has received international critical recognition as a singer, lyricist and guitarist, he is most famous in his native country, as his songwriting is rooted in [[English society]]. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about [[working class]] life. He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, often referred to as '''the Modfather''', and an influence on many subsequent British [[alternative rock]] and [[Britpop]] artists, such as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. He has received four [[Brit Awards]], including Best British Male three times, and the [[Brit Awards 2006|2006 Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music.",
