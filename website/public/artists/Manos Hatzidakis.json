  "description": "'''Manos Hatzidakis''' (also spelled '''Hadjidakis'''; {{langx|el|Μάνος Χατζιδάκις}}; 23 October 1925 – 15 June 1994) was a Greek composer and theorist of Greek music, widely regarded as one of the greatest Greek composers of all time. He was one of the main proponents of the \"[[éntekhno]]\" form of music, along with [[Mikis Theodorakis]], and he is credited as the founder of the '''Orchestra of Colours''', an ensemble performing lesser-known works and the music of Greek composers, and influenced a broad swathe of Greek culture through his writings and radio broadcasts. With his theoretical and compositional work, he is considered to be the first to connect [[post-war]] the worded music with traditional music.\n\nIn 1960, Hatzidakis won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for \"[[Never on Sunday (song)|Never on Sunday]]\" from the film ''[[Never on Sunday]]'', but he refused the award because he felt that Athens was misrepresented in the film.",
