  "description": "The '''Beastie Boys''' were an American [[hip-hop]] group formed in New York City in 1981. They were composed of [[Ad-Rock|Adam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz]] (vocals, guitar), [[Adam Yauch|Adam \"MCA\" Yauch]] (vocals, bass), and [[Mike D|Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond]] (vocals, drums). The Beastie Boys were formed out of members of experimental [[hardcore punk]] band the Young Aborigines, which was formed in 1979, with Diamond on drums, Jeremy Shatan on bass guitar, [[John Berry (Beastie Boys)|John Berry]] on guitar, and [[Kate Schellenbach]] later joining on percussion. When Shatan left New York City in mid-1981, Yauch replaced him on bass and the resulting band was named the Beastie Boys. Berry left shortly thereafter and was replaced by Horovitz.\n\nAfter achieving local success with the 1983 [[Comedy hip-hop|comedy hip hop]] single \"[[Cooky Puss]]\", the Beastie Boys made a full transition to [[Hip-hop|hip hop]], and Schellenbach left. They toured with [[Madonna]] in 1985 and a year later released their debut album, ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' (1986), the first rap album to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Their second album, ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'' (1989), was made with significant contributions by the [[Dust Brothers]] and composed almost entirely of [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. It was a commercial failure that later received critical acclaim. ''[[Check Your Head]]'' (1992) and ''[[Ill Communication]]'' (1994) found mainstream success, followed by ''[[Hello Nasty]]'' (1998), ''[[To the 5 Boroughs]]'' (2004), ''[[The Mix-Up]]'' (2007), and ''[[Hot Sauce Committee Part Two]]'' (2011).\n\nThe Beastie Boys have sold 20 million records in the United States and had seven [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling albums from 1986 to 2004. They are the biggest-selling rap group since ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' began recording sales in 1991. In 2012, they became the third rap group to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In the same year, Yauch died of cancer and the Beastie Boys disbanded. The remaining members have released several retrospective works, including a book, a [[Beastie Boys Story|documentary]], and a career-spanning [[Beastie Boys Music|compilation album]].",
