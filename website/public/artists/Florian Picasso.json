  "name": "Florian Picasso",
  "description": "'''Florian Ruiz-Picasso''' is a French [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[record producer]] based in [[Cannes]]. By adoption, he is a great-grandson of the artist, [[Pablo Picasso]]. He gained recognition for collaborations with [[Martin Garrix]], [[Nicky Romero]] and [[Steve Aoki]]. In 2016, he was ranked by [[DJ Magazine|''DJ Mag'']] at 38th on their annual list of Top 100 DJs.\n\nSince 2024, Picasso has pursued a more underground and independent musical direction. In 2025, he launched his own label, DKD Records, debuting with the ''Hi Heels'' EP, which introduced a harder, more groove-oriented techno sound. He also initiated '''Dekadance''', envisioned as a creative movement and platform for genre-blending electronic music.\n\nIn 2025, following the release of his ''Hi Heels'' EP on DKD Records, Picasso released his second major project of the year, the single ''\"When I Saw U\"''. The track was designed to evoke a sense of pure happiness and emotional uplift, aiming to capture the instant, euphoric feeling of connection when someone enters a room. Picasso’s recent work reflects his focus on releasing music independently and shaping his own artistic direction.",
