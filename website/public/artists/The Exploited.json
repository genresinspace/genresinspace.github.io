  "description": "'''The Exploited''' are a Scottish [[punk rock]] band from [[Edinburgh]], formed in 1978 by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan, with Buchan soon replaced by his brother [[Wattie Buchan]]. They signed to [[Secret Records]] in March 1981, and their debut EP, ''Army Life'', and debut album, ''[[Punks Not Dead]]'', were both released that year. The band maintained a large [[cult following]] in the 1980s among a hardcore [[working class]] punk and [[skinhead]] audience. Originally a [[street punk]] band, the Exploited eventually evolved into a [[crossover thrash]] band with the release of their album ''[[Death Before Dishonour]]'' in 1987.\n\nAlthough the Exploited continue to perform live, they have not released any studio material since their 2003 album, ''[[Fuck the System]]''. Their songs have been covered by [[Slayer]] and others. Despite numerous lineup changes, Wattie has remained the Exploited's singer and leader.",
