He has authored a collection of poems and short stories, entitled ''Ravenshark Chronicles'' published in international magazines and periodicals, which have sometimes been the basis for his travel-oriented lyrical content. In 2025, [[Expresso (newspaper)|Expresso]] newspaper stated that Ithaka's lyrics ''Forget the past, go outside, have a blast'' are words that, at one point in the 90s, had as much impact around the world as [[Timothy Leary]]'s famous expression: ''Turn on, tune in, drop out.'' In a 2005 article for the magazine ''Waves'', journalist Ricardo Macario described Ithaka as \"The Miscellaneous Man\". In a 2008 review of Ithaka's sixth album ''Saltwater Nomad'', the online surf-culture platform [[Surfline]] stated that \"the artist effortlessly traverses at ease between all of his choses mediums of expression [music, sculpture, writing and photography]\", and that \"his life's journey is a soulful balancing act somewhere between the worlds of euphoric creation and aquatic diversion.\"",
