  "description": "'''Douglas Clare Fischer''' (October 22, 1928 – January 26, 2012) was an American keyboardist, composer, arranger, and bandleader. After graduating from [[Michigan State University]] (from which, five decades later, he would receive an honorary doctorate), he became the pianist and arranger for the vocal group [[the Hi-Lo's]] in the late 1950s.\n\nFischer went on to work with [[Donald Byrd]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and became known for his Latin and [[bossa nova]] recordings in the 1960s. He composed the [[Latin jazz]] [[standard (music)|standard]] \"[[Morning (Clare Fischer composition)|Morning]]\", and the [[jazz standard]] \"[[Pensativa]]\". Consistently cited by jazz pianist and composer [[Herbie Hancock]] as a major influence (\"I wouldn't be me without Clare Fischer\"), he was nominated for eleven [[Grammy Awards]] during his lifetime, winning for his landmark album, ''[[2+2 (album)|2+2]]'' (1981), the first of Fischer's records to incorporate the vocal ensemble writing developed during his Hi-Lo's days into his already sizable Latin jazz discography; it was also the first recorded installment in Fischer's three-decade-long collaboration with his son [[Brent Fischer|Brent]]. Fischer was also a posthumous Grammy winner for ''¡Ritmo!'' (2012) and for ''Music for Strings, Percussion and the Rest'' (2013).\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, Fischer embarked on a parallel (and far more lucrative) career, eventually becoming a much sought-after arranger, providing orchestral \"sweeteners\" for [[pop music|pop]] and [[R&B]] artists such as [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] (with [[Chaka Khan]]), [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (a regular client from 1984 onwards, and by far Fischer's most frequent in pop music), [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Michael Jackson]] and many others.",
