  "description": "'''Steven Frank Albini''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|n|i}}; July 22, 1962&nbsp;– May 7, 2024) was an American musician and [[audio engineer]]. He founded and fronted the influential [[post-hardcore]] and [[noise rock]] bands [[Big Black]] (1981–1987), [[Rapeman]] (1987–1989) and [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] (1992–2024), and engineered acclaimed albums such as [[Pixies (band)|the Pixies]]' ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' (1988), [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[Rid of Me]]'', [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[In Utero]]'' (both 1993) and [[Manic Street Preachers]]' ''[[Journal for Plague Lovers]]'' (2009).\n\nAlbini was born in [[Pasadena, California]], and raised in [[Missoula, Montana]]. After discovering the [[Ramones]] as a teenager, he immersed himself in [[punk rock]] and [[underground culture]]. He earned a degree in journalism at [[Northwestern University]], Illinois, and wrote for local [[zine]]s in Chicago. He formed Big Black in 1981 and recruited [[Santiago Durango]] and [[Dave Riley]]. Big Black attracted a following, releasing two albums and four EPs. In 1987 he formed the controversially named band Rapeman with [[David Wm. Sims]] and [[Rey Washam]], releasing one album and one EP in 1988. He formed Shellac with [[Bob Weston]] and [[Todd Trainer]] in 1992, with whom he released several albums, including ''[[At Action Park]]'' (1994) and ''[[1000 Hurts]]'' (2000); ''[[To All Trains]]'' was released ten days after his death.\n\nAfter Big Black's dissolution, Albini became a sought-after recording engineer, rejecting the term \"[[record producer]]\". He recorded several thousand records, collaborating with acts such as [[the Breeders]], [[the Jesus Lizard]], [[Page and Plant]], [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Slint]]. He refused royalties on albums he worked on, operating fee-only. He founded the Chicago recording studio [[Electrical Audio]] in 1997, dedicated to recording a live sound at a cheap price.\n\nNoted for his outspoken and blunt opinions, Albini was critical of local punk scenes and the music industry, which he viewed as exploitative of artists. He was an adherent of [[analog recording]], and praised the independence in music created by the Internet. He was also infamous for authoring [[transgressive art]] as a reaction to [[Selling out|artistic compromise]], which he expressed some regret for in his final years. He died of a heart attack in 2024.",
