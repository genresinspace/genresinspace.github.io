  "description": "'''Cradle of Filth''' are an English [[extreme metal]] band formed in [[Suffolk]] in 1991. The band's musical style evolved originally from [[black metal]] to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]] and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by [[Gothic literature]], [[poetry]], [[mythology]] and [[horror film]]s. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist [[Dani Filth]], drummer [[Martin \"Marthus\" Škaroupka]], bassist Daniel Firth, and guitarist Donny Burbage.\n\nThe band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and [[MTV]], along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as [[Ozzfest]], [[Download Festival|Download]] and even the mainstream [[Sziget Festival]]. They have sometimes been perceived as [[Satanism|Satanic]] by casual observers, even though their lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for [[Shock rock|shock]] value than any seriously held beliefs. Though the band itself is English, hailing from Suffolk, over the years it has also grown to include at various times members from [[Sweden]], the [[Czech Republic]], and the [[United States]].",
