  "description": "'''Cradle of Filth''' are an English [[extreme metal]] band formed in [[Suffolk]] in 1991. The band's musical style evolved originally from [[black metal]] to a cleaner and more \"produced\" amalgam of [[gothic metal]], [[symphonic metal]] and other metal genres. Their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by [[Gothic literature]], [[poetry]], [[mythology]] and [[horror film]]s. The band consists of its founding member, vocalist [[Dani Filth]], drummer [[Martin \"Marthus\" Škaroupka]], bassist Daniel Firth, guitarists Marek \"Ashok\" Šmerda and Donny Burbage, and keyboardist Zoe Marie Federoff.\n\nThe band has broken free from its original niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage from the likes of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and [[MTV]], along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as [[Ozzfest]], [[Download Festival|Download]] and even the mainstream [[Sziget Festival]]. They have sometimes been perceived as [[Satanism|Satanic]] by casual observers, even though their lyrical references to Satanism are few and far between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for [[Shock rock|shock]] value than any seriously held beliefs.",
