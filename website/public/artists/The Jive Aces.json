  "description": "'''The Jive Aces''' are a six-piece UK-based, [[Swing music|swing]] band that was formed in 1989. They were ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' semi-finalists in 2012. They have released 12 albums, as well as compilations, EPs and singles and have performed at numerous major events, festivals, theatres and venues in over 40 countries.\n\nThe band was founded by vocalist Ian Clarkson, drummer Peter Howell (who went to school with Ian in Billericay), bassist Ken Smith and saxophonist \"Big\" John Fordham. The four met in East London jive and jazz clubs. They cut their teeth street entertaining and were soon being offered shows in UK and Europe. After several years of touring the band with various other musicians, the four met Alex Douglas (trombone, bongos, blues harp, washboard) and Vince Hurley (piano) who became permanent members. Grazia Clarkson, the band's publicist, has also become a regular performing member playing several featured songs on accordion.\n\nThe band is recognized as one of the top swing bands in the world, something borne out by their extensive international travel (the band has performed in over 40 countries). The June 2015 issue of ''Vintage Rock'' magazine described them as the \"UK's number one jive and swing band\".\n\nThey have received awards from [[Variety Club of Great Britain|Variety, the Children's Charity]] and the City of Derry International Music Award in 2006. On 12 September 2018 The Jive Aces won \"Best Band\" at the Boisdale Music Awards. The award was presented by Jools Holland, who then joined the band for a boogie woogie jam session.\n\nThe band is also notable for having strong links to the [[Church of Scientology]] as members of the [[Sea Org]]anization, and for promoting the group and its missions.",
