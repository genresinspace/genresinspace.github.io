As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. She was married to country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times, including Colorado, Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which included three children. Howard divorced her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California.\n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number-one hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid-1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories, and remained active in other ways, including regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She also worked with [[United States military]] veterans through various programs. She donated to charities and spoke at fundraisers.",
