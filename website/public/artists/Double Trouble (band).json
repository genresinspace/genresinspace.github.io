  "description": "'''Double Trouble''' is an American [[blues rock]] band from [[Austin, Texas]], which served as the backing band for singer-guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. The group was active throughout the 1980s and contributed to reviving [[blues]] music, inspiring many later blues and [[Rock music|rock]] acts. Formed in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1978, the group went through several early line-up changes before settling on a [[power trio]] consisting of Vaughan, [[Chris Layton]] (drums), and [[Tommy Shannon]] (bass).  They became a four-piece by 1985 after adding [[Reese Wynans]] (keyboards). Whilst with Vaughan they were billed '''Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble'''. Rooted in blues and rock music, the group worked in various genres ranging from [[ballad]]s to [[Soul music|soul]], often incorporating [[jazz]] and other musical elements.\n\nInitially a five-piece lineup with Vaughan, [[Lou Ann Barton]] (vocals), Fredde Walden (drums), Jackie Newhouse (bass) and Johnny Reno (saxophone), they built their reputation playing clubs around [[Texas]] over a four-year period. Molded into a trio (Vaughan, Layton, Shannon), their musical potential was encouraged by producer [[John H. Hammond]], who got the band a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]. They gained popularity after their debut album, ''[[Texas Flood]]'', became a critical and commercial success in 1983. By the mid-1980s, they had become an international act, touring extensively around the world until August 1990, when Vaughan was [[Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan|killed in a helicopter crash]] after departing [[East Troy, Wisconsin]].\n\nVarious posthumous releases featuring Vaughan have been issued since his death, overseen by his brother [[Jimmie Vaughan|Jimmie]].
