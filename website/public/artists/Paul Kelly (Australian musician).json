He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He has worked with other artists and groups, including associated projects [[Professor Ratbaggy]] and [[Stardust Five]]. Kelly's music style has ranged from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] to studio-oriented [[dub music|dub]] [[reggae]], but his core output straddles [[folk music|folk]], rock and [[country music|country]]. His lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. [[David Fricke]] from ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]'' calls Kelly \"one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise\". Kelly has said, \"Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet.\"\n\nAfter growing up in [[Adelaide]], Kelly travelled around Australia before settling in [[Melbourne]] in 1976. He became involved in the [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] scene and drug culture and recorded two albums with the Dots. Kelly moved to Sydney by 1985, where he formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The band was renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, initially only for international releases, to avoid possible racial interpretations of the word \"coloured\". At the end of the 1980s, Kelly returned to Melbourne, and in 1991 he disbanded the Messengers.\n\nKelly's Top 40 singles include \"[[Billy Baxter (song)|Billy Baxter]]\", \"[[Before Too Long]]\", \"[[Darling It Hurts]]\", \"[[To Her Door]]\" (his highest-charting local hit in 1987), \"[[Dumb Things]]\" (appeared on United States charts in 1988) and \"[[Roll on Summer]]\". Top-20 albums include ''[[Gossip (Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls album)|Gossip]]'', ''[[Under the Sun (Paul Kelly album)|Under the Sun]]'', ''[[Comedy (Paul Kelly & The Messengers album)|Comedy]]'', ''[[Songs from the South]]'' (1997 [[compilation album|compilation]]), ''[[...Nothing but a Dream]]'', ''[[Stolen Apples (album)|Stolen Apples]]'', ''[[Spring and Fall (album)|Spring and Fall]]'', ''[[The Merri Soul Sessions]]'', ''Seven Sonnets and a Song'', ''Death's Dateless Night'' (with [[Charlie Owen (musician)|Charlie Owen]]), ''[[Life Is Fine]]'' (his first number-one album) and ''[[Nature (Paul Kelly album)|Nature]]''. Kelly has won 14 [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) Music Awards, including his induction into their [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997#Hall of Fame Inductees|hall of fame in 1997]]. [[Dan Kelly (musician)|Dan Kelly]], his nephew, is a singer and guitarist in his own right. Dan performed with Kelly on ''Ways and Means'' and ''Stolen Apples''. Both were members of Stardust Five, which released a [[Stardust Five (album)|self-titled album]] in 2006. On 22 September 2010, Kelly released his memoir, ''[[How to Make Gravy]]'', which he described as \"it's not traditional; it's writing around the A–Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order\". His biographical film ''[[Paul Kelly: Stories of Me]]'', directed by [[Ian Darling]], was released to cinemas in October 2012.\n\nIn 2001, the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) listed the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time, which included Kelly's ''[[To Her Door]]'', and [[Treaty (song)|''Treaty'']], written by Kelly and members of [[Yothu Yindi]]. Aside from ''Treaty'', Kelly wrote or co-wrote several songs on [[Indigenous Australian]] social issues and historical events. He provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. The album ''Women at the Well'' from 2002 had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.\n\nKelly was appointed as an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician. Kelly was married and divorced twice; he has three children and resides in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], a suburb of Melbourne.",
