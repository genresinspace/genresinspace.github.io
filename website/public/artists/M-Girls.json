  "description": "'''M-Girls''' ({{lang-zh|s=四个女生}}) was a Malaysian [[girl group]] consisting of [[Queenzy Cheng]], Angeline Khoo, Cass Chin and Crystal Ong. The group was formed in 2001.\n\nAlthough M-Girls studio albums have been officially released in many different parts of the world, the group has been a longstanding victim to [[piracy]] and unlicensed, illegal distribution. As a result, the group's music company, Starmedia, decided to stop producing additional M-Girls albums in 2014. This announcement came out during the release of the Chinese New Year album ''True Happiness'' (真歡喜) in February 2014, weeks after the release of their [[Extended play|EP]], ''My Way''.\n\nIn 2015, M-Girls released one last CNY album, ''New Spring Holiday'' (新春佳期), through Starmedia. Afterwards, the group later on decided to part ways with the music company and established their own company, MG Entertainment. This new company's first album release was entitled ''The New Year is Coming'' (年來了), which came out in 2016.\n\nAs of 2017, the members of M-Girls are taking a break from working together as a group and would not be producing any albums together. Instead, everyone is currently pursuing solo projects and endeavors for the time being.\n\nIn November 2023, Cheng died at the age of 37 while filming a video production.",
