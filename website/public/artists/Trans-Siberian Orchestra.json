  "description": "'''Trans-Siberian Orchestra''' ('''TSO''') is an American rock band founded in 1996 by producer, composer, and lyricist [[Paul O'Neill (producer)|Paul O'Neill]], who brought together [[Jon Oliva]] and [[Al Pitrelli]] (both members of [[Savatage]]) and keyboardist and co-producer [[Robert Kinkel]] to form the core of the creative team. The band gained in popularity when they began touring in 1999 after completing their second album, ''The Christmas Attic'', the year previous. In 2007, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to them as \"an [[arena-rock]] juggernaut\" and described their music as \"[[Pink Floyd]] meets [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[the Who]] at [[Radio City Music Hall]]\". TSO has sold more than ten million concert tickets and over ten million albums. The band has released a series of [[rock opera]]s: ''[[Christmas Eve and Other Stories]]'', ''[[The Christmas Attic]]'', ''[[Beethoven's Last Night]]'', ''[[The Lost Christmas Eve]]'', their two-disc ''[[Night Castle]]'' and ''[[Letters from the Labyrinth]]''. Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which include a string section, a light show, lasers, moving trusses, video screens, and effects synchronized to music.\n\nBoth ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' and ''[[Pollstar]]'' have ranked them as one of the top twenty-five ticket-selling bands in the first decade of the new millennium. Their path to success was unusual in that, according to O'Neill, TSO is the first major rock band to go straight to theaters and arenas, having never played at a club, never having been an opening act and never having had an opening act.",
