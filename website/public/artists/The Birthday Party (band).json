  "name": "The Birthday Party",
  "description": "'''The Birthday Party''' (originally known as '''the Boys Next Door''') were an Australian [[post-punk]] band, active from 1977 to 1983. The group's \"bleak and noisy soundscapes,\" which drew irreverently on [[blues music|blues]], [[free jazz]], and [[rockabilly]], provided the setting for vocalist [[Nick Cave]]'s disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their 1981 single \"[[Release the Bats]]\" was particularly influential on the emerging [[gothic rock|gothic]] scene. Despite limited commercial success, the Birthday Party's influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called \"one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early '80s.\"\n\nIn 1980, the Birthday Party moved from [[Melbourne]] to London, where they were championed by broadcaster [[John Peel]]. They subsequently released two albums: ''[[Prayers on Fire]]'' (1981) and ''[[Junkyard (album)|Junkyard]]'' (1982). Disillusioned by their stay in London, the band's sound and live shows became increasingly violent. They broke up soon after relocating to [[West Berlin]] in 1982. The creative core of the Birthday Party – singer and songwriter Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter [[Mick Harvey]], and singer, songwriter and guitarist [[Rowland S. Howard]] – later went on to acclaimed careers.",
