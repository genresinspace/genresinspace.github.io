Her work features experimental [[sound design]], \"sugary\" synthesised textures, and incorporation of underground [[dance music|dance]] styles. She would help pioneer the 2010s [[hyperpop]] microgenre.\n\nSophie rose to prominence with a string of breakthrough singles led by \"[[Bipp]]\" (2013); these were compiled on the singles collection ''[[Product (Sophie album)|Product]]'' (2015). She concealed her identity early in her solo career, but came out publicly as [[transgender]] in 2017. The following year, Sophie released the studio album ''[[Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides]]'', earning a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album]]. She worked closely with artists from the [[PC Music]] label, including [[A. G. Cook]] and [[GFOTY]], and also produced for acts such as [[Charli XCX]], [[Vince Staples]], [[Kim Petras]], [[Madonna]], [[Hayden Dunham|Hyd]], [[ITZY]], [[Gaika (musician)|Gaika]], and [[Namie Amuro]].\n\nSophie died in January 2021 after a fall in [[Athens]], Greece. ''[[AllMusic]]'' eulogised her as a \"fearless trailblazer in [[electronic music]]\" who \"bridged the mainstream and the [[avant-garde]] like few other artists\", while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' credited her work with \"revolutioniz[ing] the sound of underground [[dance music|dance]] and pop music\". A [[Sophie (album)|self-titled second studio album]], reportedly \"nearly finished\" at the time of her death and completed by her brother Benny Long, was released posthumously in 2024.",
