Follow‑ups ''[[Steeltown]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Seer (Big Country album)|The Seer]]'' (1986) also landed in the UK top ten, with ''The Seer'' producing the Irish No. 1 hit “[[Look Away (Big Country song)|Look Away]]” and featuring a collaboration with [[Kate Bush]] on its title track.\n\nAfter Adamson’s death by suicide in December 2001, the classic lineup disbanded. Surviving members reunited in 2007 for anniversary tours, later joined by singer [[Mike Peters (musician)|Mike Peters]] and changing bassists, culminating in the 2013 album ''[[The Journey (Big Country album)|The Journey]]'', their first new studio release in 14 years.",
