After releasing two albums with the band, she left Big Brother to continue as a solo artist with her own backing groups, first the {{interlanguage link|Kozmic Blues Band|it||pt}} and then the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]]. She performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] and on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' train tour. Five singles by Joplin reached the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Kris Kristofferson]] song \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\", which posthumously reached number one in March 1971.

A second solo album, ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'', was released in January 1971, three months after her death. It reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. She was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Joplin  number 28 on its 2008 list of the \"[[Rolling Stone's 200 Greatest Singers of All Time|200 Greatest Singers of All Time]]\", dropping to number 78 in the 2023 list.
