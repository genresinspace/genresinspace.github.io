  "description": "'''Zohra Al Fassiya''' ({{langx|ar|زهرة الفاسية}}, {{langx|he|זוהרה אלפסיה}}) was a [[Moroccan people|Moroccan]] singer and poet. Considered as the queen of the [[Malhun|melhoun]] and [[Gharnati music|gharnati]] genres, and one of the pioneers of modern Arabic music, she was the first female recording artist in Morocco, and her songs were widely celebrated throughout Morocco and Algeria, where she collaborated with lyricists and musicians from Oran and Tlemcen. Although her songs were mostly secular in nature (being the popular music of the time in Morocco), many of the melodies have later been modified to be fit religious Jewish liturgical songs (called piyyutim) as well.",
