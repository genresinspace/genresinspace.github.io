  "name": "Holland–Dozier–Holland",
  "description": "'''Holland&ndash;Dozier&ndash;Holland''', often abbreviated as '''H-D-H''', was a [[Songwriter|songwriting]] and [[Record producer|production]] team consisting of [[Lamont Dozier]] and brothers [[Brian Holland|Brian]] and [[Eddie Holland]].  The trio wrote, arranged and produced many songs that helped define the [[Motown sound]] in the 1960s. During their tenure at [[Motown Records]] from 1962 to 1967, Dozier and Brian Holland were the composers and producers for each song, and Eddie Holland wrote the lyrics and arranged the vocals. Their most celebrated productions were singles for the [[Four Tops]] and [[the Supremes]], including 10 of the Supremes' 12 US No. 1 singles, including \"[[Baby Love]]\", \"[[Stop! In the Name of Love]]\", and \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\". Their legal representative entity was known as '''Holland–Dozier–Holland Productions, Inc.''' or '''HDHP'''.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1972, due to a legal dispute with Motown, they did not write material under their own names, but instead used the collective [[pseudonym]] \"'''Edythe Wayne'''\". When the trio left Motown, they continued to work as a production team (with Eddie Holland being added to the producer credits), and as a songwriting team, until 1973.\n\nThe trio was inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1988 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1990.",
