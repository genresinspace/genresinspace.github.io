The drummer began his career as a bandleader in the early 1970s. Perhaps his two most notable groups were a longstanding trio with guitarist [[Bill Frisell]] and saxophonist [[Joe Lovano]] as well as the Electric Bebop Band, in which he worked mostly with younger musicians on interpretations of [[bebop]] standards.",
