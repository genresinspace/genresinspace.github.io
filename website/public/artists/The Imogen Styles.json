  "description": "'''The Imogen Styles''' are an English [[electropop]] [[musical ensemble|band]] consisting of Christopher Dresden Styles and Syma.  The band cite [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[The Human League]], [[Soft Cell]] and [[Black Box Recorder]] as musical influences.\n\nThe band was formed in 2005, when Christopher Dresden Styles was offered the chance to play a gig at an [[Unsigned artist|unsigned band]] night at Retro Bar in [[Manchester]] on Monday 11 July. At the time, The Imogen Styles consisted solely of Christopher as [[Lead vocalist|frontman]], along with a [[music stand]], which was used to display the title of the [[song]] he was [[singing]] at the time. All the [[music]] was supplied as a [[backing track]] from an [[iPod]]. After the success of this first gig, other gig offers followed.\n\nAs an added incentive for people to turn up for The Imogen Stylesâ€™ early gigs, Christopher often arranged for [[badge]]s to be given out to attendees. The badges were often labelled with the gig number as a [[souvenir]] for those who turned up.\n\nIn March 2008, Syma joined the band as an additional [[Singing|vocalist]].\n\nThe band launched a new [[website]] in January 2012 which showcases new tracks and accompanying [[music video]]s.\n\nTo mark [[Kylie Minogue]]'s K25 celebrations, commemorating her twenty five years in the music business, the band covered the classic [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Jason Donovan]] duet, \"[[Especially for You]]\".",
