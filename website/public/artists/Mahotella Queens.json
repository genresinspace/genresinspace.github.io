  "description": "The '''Mahotella Queens''' is a South African female group established in 1964. The group is one of the most prominent specialising in [[mbaqanga]], a style born in the recording studios of 1960s South Africa and the first genre in the country to utilise fully electric rhythm accompaniment. The Queens developed an upbeat and distinct identity which combined multi-part girl group harmonies with energetic stage choreography, the baritone male vocals of [[Mahlathini|Simon 'Mahlathini' Nkabinde]] and intense backup from the [[Makgona Tsohle Band]], offering listeners happy respite during the oppressive era of [[apartheid]]. The original line-up of the Queens usually revolved around five singers fronted by popular soprano [[Hilda Tloubatla]], but its membership evolved significantly into the 1970s and 1980s. A successful tour of France in 1987 comprising three of the original Queens - Tloubatla, [[Nobesuthu Mbadu]] and [[Mildred Mangxola]] - paved the way for an international touring career that has lasted across four decades, in spite of the deaths of Mahlathini and several Makgona Tsohle Band members. Since 2017, the line-up of the Mahotella Queens has consisted of Tloubatla, Amanda Nkosi and Nonku Maseko.",
