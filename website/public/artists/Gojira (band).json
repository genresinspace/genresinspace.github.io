Gojira has been known for its [[Progressive metal|progressive]] and [[technical death metal]] styles and [[Spirituality|spiritual]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], and [[Environmentalism in music|environmentally themed lyrics]]. The band has gone \"from the utmost obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global recognition in the second\".\n\nGojira's first two albums, ''[[Terra Incognita (Gojira album)|Terra Incognita]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Link (album)|The Link]]'' (2003), and powerful live performances established its reputation as a leading French metal band. ''[[Maciste All'Inferno (album)|Maciste All'Inferno]]'' was a silent [[film score]] composed and performed for a one-night show in [[Bordeaux]]. Its third album, the critically acclaimed ''[[From Mars to Sirius]]'' (2005) with \"Backbone\", \"The Heaviest Matter of the Universe\", and \"Flying Whales\", was covered in the British metal press. The band then signed with [[Prosthetic Records]], which gave it visibility in North America. The follow-up album, ''[[The Way of All Flesh (album)|The Way of All Flesh]]'' (2008), charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and Gojira later launched its first overseas headlining tour.\n\nThe band began recording the ''[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]] [[Extended play|EP]]'' in a collaborative framework involving several metal musicians.

In 2020, it released its first {{nowrap|''Billboard''-charting}} single, \"Another World\". The chart-topping ''[[Fortitude (album)|Fortitude]]'' (2021) was the [[Top Album Sales#2021|best-selling album]] in the US during its first week.
