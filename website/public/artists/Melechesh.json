  "description": "'''Melechesh''' is an ethnically Assyrian [[black metal]] band that originated in [[Jerusalem]] and is currently based in [[Amsterdam]]. Ashmedi started the band as a solo project in 1993. In the following year, guitarist Moloch and drummer Lord Curse were added to the line-up. The band's goal was to create a type of black metal incorporating extensive Middle Eastern influences mainly based on [[Assyria]]n ([[Mesopotamian]]) and [[occult]] themes (both musically and lyrically); the band invented the title \"Mesopotamian metal\" or \"Sumerian Black Thrashing Metal\" to best describe their type of metal. They are sometimes referred to as [[oriental metal]].",
