Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop acts of all time, the duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize [[Southern hip-hop]] with their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies, and positive themes, while experimenting with a diverse range of genres such as [[funk]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[jazz]], and [[techno]].\n\nPatton and Benjamin formed Outkast as high school students. They released their debut studio album ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'' in 1994, which gained popularity after its single \"[[Player's Ball]]\" peaked atop the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart. The duo further experimented and honed their sound with their second and third albums ''[[ATLiens]]'' (1996) and ''[[Aquemini]]'' (1998), both of which were met with critical acclaim. They then achieved mainstream recognition and continued acclaim with their fourth album ''[[Stankonia]]'' (2000), which was supported by the singles \"[[B.O.B (song)|B.O.B.]]\" and \"[[Ms. Jackson]]\", the latter of which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group|Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] at the [[44th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nThe duo then released the [[double album]] ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' (2003), their only album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It received [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), was supported by their second and third number one singles: \"[[The Way You Move]]\" (performed by Big Boi) and \"[[Hey Ya!]]\" (performed by André 3000), respectively, and won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]]. Outkast starred in the 2006 musical film ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'' and recorded the film's accompanying soundtrack, which was released as their [[Idlewild (Outkast album)|final album]] three days before the film's release. The duo split the following year, and both members have pursued solo careers. Outkast temporarily reunited in 2014 to celebrate their debut album's 20th anniversary with performances at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the [[Coachella Festival]] in April 2014.\n\nAlong with being one of hip-hop's most influential acts, Outkast is also one of the most successful, having certified sales of 20 million records between [[Outkast discography|six studio albums]] and [[Big Boi and Dre Present...
