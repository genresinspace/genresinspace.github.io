  "name": "Steve Lacy",
  "description": "'''Steve Lacy''' (born '''Steven Norman Lackritz'''; July 23, 1934 â€“ June 4, 2004) was an American [[jazz]] saxophonist and composer recognized as one of the important players of [[soprano saxophone]]. Coming to prominence in the 1950s as a [[Dixieland|progressive dixieland]] musician, Lacy went on to a long and prolific career. He worked extensively in experimental jazz and to a lesser extent in [[free improvisation]], but Lacy's music was typically melodic and tightly-structured. Lacy also became a highly distinctive composer, with compositions often built out of little more than a single questioning phrase, repeated several times.\n\nThe music of [[Thelonious Monk]] became a permanent part of Lacy's repertoire after a stint in the pianist's band, with Monk's works appearing on virtually every Lacy album and concert program; Lacy often partnered with trombonist [[Roswell Rudd]] in exploring Monk's work. Beyond Monk, Lacy performed the work of jazz composers such as [[Charles Mingus]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Herbie Nichols]]; unlike many jazz musicians he rarely played standard popular or show tunes.",
