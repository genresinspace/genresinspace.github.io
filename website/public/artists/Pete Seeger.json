  "description": "'''Peter Seeger''' (May 3, 1919&nbsp;â€“ January 27, 2014) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and social activist. He was a fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s and had a string of hit records in the early 1950s as a member of [[The Weavers]], notably their recording of [[Lead Belly]]'s \"[[Goodnight, Irene]]\", which topped the charts for 14 weeks in 1950. Members of the Weavers were [[blacklist]]ed during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Era]]. In the 1960s, Seeger re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of [[protest song|protest music]] in support of [[nuclear disarmament|international disarmament]], [[civil rights]], [[workers' rights]], [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], [[environmentalism|environmental causes]], and ending the [[Vietnam War]].\n\nAmong the prolific songwriter's best-known songs are \"[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]\" (with additional lyrics by [[Joe Hickerson]]), \"[[If I Had a Hammer]] (The Hammer Song)\" (with [[Lee Hays]] of the Weavers), \"[[Kisses Sweeter than Wine]]\" (also with Hays), and \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]] (To Everything There Is a Season)\", which has been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement. \"Flowers\" was a hit recording for [[The Kingston Trio]] (1962); [[Marlene Dietrich]], who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and [[Johnny Rivers]] (1965). \"If I Had a Hammer\" was a hit for [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] (1962) and [[Trini Lopez]] (1963) while [[The Byrds]] had a number one hit with \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" in 1965.\n\nSeeger was one of the folk singers responsible for popularizing the [[Spirituals|spiritual]] \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\" (also recorded by [[Joan Baez]] and many other singer-activists), which became the acknowledged anthem of the [[civil rights movement]], soon after folk singer and activist [[Guy Carawan]] introduced it at the founding meeting of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in 1960. In the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' episode \"[[Pete Seeger: The Power of Song]]\", Seeger said it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional \"We will overcome\" to the more singable \"We shall overcome\".",
