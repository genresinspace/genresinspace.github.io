  "description": "'''Level 42''' are an English [[jazz-funk]] band formed on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1979. They had a number of UK and worldwide hits during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nLevel 42's highest-charting single in the UK was \"[[Lessons in Love (Level 42 song)|Lessons in Love]]\", which reached number three on the [[UK singles chart]], and number 12 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, upon its release in 1986. An earlier single, \"[[Something About You (Level 42 song)|Something About You]]\", was their most successful chart-wise in the United States, reaching number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.\n\nAfter much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile diminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical shifts. Disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001.",
