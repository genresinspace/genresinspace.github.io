Noted for her{{efn|Halsey uses both [[She (pronoun)|she/her]] and [[Singular they|they/them]] pronouns and switches between them; this article uses she/her pronouns for consistency.}} distinctive singing voice, she has received several accolades including three [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], a [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' Women in Music Award]], an [[American Music Award]], and has received nominations for three [[Grammy Awards]]. She was on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} annual list of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2020.\n\nHalsey was born and grew up in [[Central Jersey]]. Gaining attention from self-released music on social media platforms, she signed with [[Astralwerks]] in 2014 and released her debut [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Room 93]]'', in October of that year. Her debut studio album, [[Badlands (Halsey album)|''Badlands'']] (2015), was met with critical and commercial success—debuting at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), along with its singles \"[[Colors (Halsey song)|Colors]]\", \"[[Gasoline (Halsey song)|Gasoline]]\" and \"[[New Americana]]\", the latter of which became her first entry on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number 60.\n\nIn 2016, Halsey co-performed with [[the Chainsmokers]] on their single \"[[Closer (The Chainsmokers song)|Closer]]\", which topped the charts in the US and ten countries, while receiving 14× platinum certification by the RIAA. Her second studio album, ''[[Hopeless Fountain Kingdom]]'' (2017) embodied a more \"radio-friendly\" sound and debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200, while its singles \"[[Now or Never (Halsey song)|Now or Never]]\" and \"[[Bad at Love]]\", both entered the top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100—the latter peaked within the top five. Her 2018 single, \"[[Eastside (song)|Eastside]]\" (with [[Benny Blanco]] and [[Khalid (American singer)|Khalid]]), found continued success and peaked within the top ten. Later that year, she was moved to [[Capitol Records]].\n\nHalsey's third studio album, ''[[Manic (Halsey album)|Manic]]'' (2020), became her best selling album worldwide. Its lead single, \"[[Without Me (Halsey song)|Without Me]]\" topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, received [[RIAA certification|diamond certification]] by the RIAA, and yielded her furthest commercial success as a lead artist. Her fourth album, ''[[If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power]]'' (2021), moved away from her previous sound in favor of a darker [[Industrial music|industrial]] sound to generally positive reception. She then parted ways with Capitol in 2023, following a controversy surrounding the release of her non-album single, \"[[So Good (Halsey song)|So Good]]\" the year prior. After signing with [[Columbia Records]], Halsey's fifth studio album ''[[The Great Impersonator]]'' followed in 2024. By 2020, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] reported that her albums had sold over one million combined units, and received over six billion streams in the United States. Aside from music, she has been involved in [[suicide prevention]] awareness, [[sexual assault]] victim advocacy, and [[racial justice]] protests.",
