The band have become famous for their [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanist]] views and for their live shows which involve pyrotechnics, candles, Satanic rituals, animal carcasses, and blood. At a now-notorious live performance in Brooklyn in 2014, they doused audience members in animal blood, allegedly causing some members of the audience to vomit. This was picked up and publicised by [[TMZ]], generating controversy around the incident. To date they have released seven full-length albums, as well as three live albums and a number of demos and EPs. Their most recent album ''The Agony & Ecstasy of Watain'' was released on 29 April 2022 through [[Nuclear Blast]]. The band's core lineup has remained stable since their formation, consisting of Erik Danielsson, Pelle Forsberg, and HÃ¥kan Jonsson, though as of 2015 Jonsson no longer performs live, Emil Svensson (aka E. Forcas) of fellow [[Uppsala]] [[death metal]] band Degial was recruited as live drummer.",
