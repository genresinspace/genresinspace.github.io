Formed in Detroit in 1989, ICP's best-known lineup consists of rappers [[Violent&nbsp;J]] (Joseph Bruce) and [[Shaggy&nbsp;2 Dope]] (originally 2 Dope; Joseph Utsler). Insane Clown Posse performs a style of [[hardcore hip hop]] known as [[horrorcore]] and is known for its elaborate live performances. The duo has earned two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and five gold albums. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the entire catalog of the group had sold 6.5&nbsp;million units in the United States and Canada {{as of|2007|04|lc=yes}}. The group has established a dedicated following called [[Juggalo]]s numbering in the \"tens of thousands\".\n\nOriginally known as ''JJ Boyz'' and ''Inner City Posse'', the group introduced [[supernatural]] and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label [[Psychopathic Records]] with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'' and ''[[Big Money Rustlas]]''. They formed their own [[professional wrestling]] promotion, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]], and have collaborated with many hip hop and [[rock music]]ians.\n\nThe songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]], a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the \"evil ways\" of listeners before \"the end consumes us all\".",
