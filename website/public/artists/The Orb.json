  "name": "The Orb",
  "description": "'''The Orb''' is an English [[electronic music]] group founded in 1988 by [[Alex Paterson]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]]. Known for their [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] sound, the Orb developed a cult following among [[clubbers]] \"coming down\" from drug-induced highs. Their influential 1991 debut album ''[[The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld]]'' pioneered the UK's nascent [[ambient house]] movement, while its UK chart-topping follow-up ''[[U.F.Orb]]'' represented the group's commercial peak.\n\nBeginning as [[ambient music|ambient]] and [[dub music|dub]] DJs in [[London]], the Orb's early performances were inspired by electronic artists of the 1970s, most notably [[Brian Eno]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], and [[Kraftwerk]]. The Orb have maintained their signature [[List of science fiction themes|science fiction]] aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members [[Kris Weston]], Andy Falconer, [[Simon Phillips (producer)|Simon Phillips]], Nick Burton, and [[Andy Hughes]]. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer [[Thomas Fehlmann]], and later, with [[Martin \"Youth\" Glover]], bassist of [[Killing Joke]]. Paterson's unauthorised use of [[sampling (music)|other artists' works]] has led to multiple disputes, most notably with [[Rickie Lee Jones]].\n\nDuring their live shows in the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and other digital media. Featuring colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery, their performances often incited comparisons to [[Pink Floyd]], whose guitarist, [[David Gilmour]], later collaborated with them on the album ''[[Metallic Spheres]]'' in 2010.\n\nTheir seventeenth studio album, ''[[Prism (The Orb album)|Prism]]'', was released on 28 April 2023 by [[Cooking Vinyl]].",
