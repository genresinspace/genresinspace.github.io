  "name": "Finsterforst",
  "description": "'''Finsterforst''' is a German [[folk metal]] band from [[Schwarzwald]], [[Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg]], whose lyrical themes deal with nature, [[German myths]], and fantasy worlds. Formed in 2004, the group has released five studio albums, one extended play and one compilation album. Finsterforst means \"dark forest\" and it is a reference to \"[[Schwarzwald]]\" (\"black forest\"), a wooded mountain range in the band's home state.\n\nBesides the usual line-up of instruments used in metal (guitar, bass, drums), the band's sound relies heavily on [[accordion]] melodies, with the occasional use of instruments such as the [[tin whistle]] and the [[oboe]]. The band's genre is often dubbed [[pagan metal]] because of its use of harsh vocals.\n\nSeveral Finsterforst members also play in Cryptic Forest, a [[black metal]] band from Schwarzwald.",
