  "description": "'''T. Rex''' (originally '''Tyrannosaurus Rex''') were  an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Marc Bolan]], who was their leader, frontman and only consistent member. Though initially associated with the [[psychedelic folk]] genre, Bolan began to change the band's style towards electric rock in 1969, and shortened their name to T. Rex the following year. This development culminated in 1970 with their first significant hit single \"[[Ride a White Swan]]\", and the group soon became pioneers of the [[glam rock]] movement.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, T. Rex were extremely popular in the UK, with a run of eleven top ten singles, four of which reached number one: \"[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]\", \"[[Get It On (T. Rex song)|Get It On]]\", \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Metal Guru]]\". The band's 1971 album ''[[Electric Warrior]]'' received critical acclaim, reached number 1 in the UK and became a landmark album in glam rock. The 1972 follow-up, ''[[The Slider]]'', entered the top 20 in the US. Bolstering their style with [[soul music]], [[funk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]], the band released ''[[Tanx]]'' in 1973 which reached the top 5 in several countries. From 1974, T. Rex's appeal began to wane, though the band continued releasing albums. Their subsequent releases blended rock with [[R&B]] and occasionally even [[disco]].\n\nIn 1977, Bolan died in a car crash several months after the release of the group's final studio album ''[[Dandy in the Underworld]]'', and the group disbanded. T. Rex have continued to influence a variety of subsequent artists. The band were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2020.",
