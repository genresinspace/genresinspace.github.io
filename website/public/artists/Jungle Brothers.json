  "name": "Jungle Brothers",
  "description": "'''Jungle Brothers''' are an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] trio composed of Michael Small (Mike Gee), Nathaniel Hall (Afrika Baby Bam) and Sammy Burwell (DJ Sammy B). Hailed as pioneers of the fusion of [[jazz]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[house music]], they were the first hip-hop group to collaborate with a house-music producer. The trio released their debut album, ''[[Straight out the Jungle]]'', in July 1988. Their [[Hip house|hip-house]] club hit single, \"I'll House You\" was added to the album in late-1988 reissues. Fostered by [[Kool DJ Red Alert]], the Jungle Brothers' success paved the way for [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and eventually the [[Native Tongues]] collective that they founded.",
