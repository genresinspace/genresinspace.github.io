  "description": "'''Leon Redbone''' (born '''Dickran Gobalian'''; August 26, 1949 – May 30, 2019) was a singer-songwriter and musician specializing in [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[Tin Pan Alley]] classics. Recognized by his hat (often a [[Panama hat|Panama]]), dark sunglasses, and black tie, he was born in [[Cyprus]] of [[Armenians|Armenian]] ancestry and first appeared on stage in [[Toronto, Canada]], in the early 1970s. He also appeared on film and television in acting and voice-over roles.\n\nIn concert, Redbone often employed comedy and demonstrated his guitar-playing skill. His recurrent gags involved the influence of alcohol and claims he had written works originating well before he was born. He favored music of the [[Tin Pan Alley]] era, circa 1890–1910. He sang the theme to the 1980s television series ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]'', and released 18 albums.",
