  "description": "'''Rap Against Dictatorship''' ('''RAD''') is a Thai [[political hip-hop]] group that mainly produces anti-[[military junta]], [[dictator]], and pro-[[democracy]] rap music. They were founded in 2017 by the rapper Liberate P. Their first single, \"My Country Has\" ({{langx|th|ประเทศกูมี}}), was released in 2018. After the release the police threatened to arrest the members but quickly backed down after the music video went viral. In 2019 they were awarded with the [[Václav Havel Prize for Creative Dissent]] at the [[Oslo Freedom Forum]]. During the [[2020–2021 Thai protests]] one of the members got arrested together with pro-democracy activists and was charged with [[sedition]]. The group's music has been censored in Thailand multiple times due to its anti-government and anti-monarchy message.",
