To date, Bajrami has released nine studio albums and is regarded as one of the most popular singers from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\nThroughout her career, Bajrami's musical style has evolved significantly. She began with a distinctively [[Balkan music|Balkan]] [[folk-pop]] sound in the late [[1990s in music|1990s]], characterized by [[traditional instruments]] and emotive vocals. By the early [[2000s in music|2000s]], she incorporated more pronounced pop-folk elements, blending [[turbo-folk]] rhythms with [[contemporary pop]] influences, which helped her gain a wider audience across the [[former Yugoslavia]].\n\nWith the release of [[Kakvo tijelo Selma ima|''Kakvo tijelo Selma ima'']] (2004), she introduced more provocative themes and [[Dance music|dance]]-oriented tracks, solidifying her image as a bold and dynamic performer. The 2007 album [[Ostrvo tuge|''Ostrvo tuge'']] marked a shift towards a more polished pop production with traces of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Ballad music|balladic]] expressions, reflecting personal and emotional depth. In later years, especially throughout the [[2010s in music|2010s]], Bajrami experimented with modern pop, [[Urban music|urban]] sounds, and collaborations with rappers and younger producers, keeping her music relevant to newer generations.\n\nDespite stylistic shifts, Bajrami maintained a distinctive vocal delivery marked by a powerful, emotive timbre, which remained her artistic signature across decades.",
