His banjo style is the [[clawhammer]] or [[frailing]] style, distinct from more commonly found [[Scruggs style]] of banjo playing in modern bluegrass.

The \"Bicycle Wreck\" song is often played by Troy on the washboard. His major musical influence is attributed to [[Uncle Dave Macon]] and others taught by him.
