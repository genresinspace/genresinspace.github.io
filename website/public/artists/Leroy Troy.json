His banjo style is the [[clawhammer]] or [[frailing]] style, distinct from more commonly found [[Scruggs style]] in modern bluegrass banjo playing. He often performs humorous or comedy songs from the [[old-time music]] genre. Troy often uses a [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] with various sound-making devices affixed to it. The \"Bicycle Wreck\" song is often played by Troy on the washboard. His major musical influences are attributed to [[Uncle Dave Macon]] and others taught by him. Troy debuted on the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in 1988 and was the National Old-Time Banjo Champion in 1996.\n\nTroy is known as \"the Tennessee Slicker\" and \"the Sultan of Goodlettsville\" and plays with the Tennessee Mafia Jugband and [[Marty Stuart]]; he appeared weekly on ''The Marty Stuart Show'' on [[RFD-TV]].",
