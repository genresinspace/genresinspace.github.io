  "description": "'''Michael Webb Pierce''' (August 8, 1921 – February 24, 1991) was an American [[country music]] vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist of the 1950s, one of the most popular of the genre, charting more number-one hits than any other country and western performer during the decade.\n\nHis biggest hit was the [[Honky-tonk music|honky-tonk]]-rooted \"[[In the Jailhouse Now]]\", which charted for 37 weeks in 1955, 21 of them at number one. Pierce also charted number one for several weeks each with his recordings of \"[[Slowly (song)|Slowly]]\" (1954), \"[[Love Love Love (Webb Pierce song)|Love, Love, Love]]\" (1955), \"[[I Don't Care (Webb Pierce song)|I Don't Care]]\" (1955), \"[[There Stands the Glass]]\" (1953), \"[[More and More (Webb Pierce song)|More and More]]\" (1954), \"[[I Ain't Never]]\" (1959), and his first number one, \"[[Wondering (Webb Pierce song)|Wondering]]\", which stayed at the top spot for four of its 27 weeks' charting in 1952.\n\nFor many, Pierce, with his flamboyant [[Nudie suit]]s and twin silver dollar-lined convertibles, became the most recognizable face of country music of the era and its excesses. Pierce was a one-time member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and was posthumously inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. A [[Album#Tribute or cover|tribute album]] in his honor (produced by singer-songwriter [[Gail Davies]]) was released in 2001 entitled ''Caught in the Webb – A Tribute to Country Legend Webb Pierce''.",
