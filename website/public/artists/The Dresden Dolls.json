  "description": "'''The Dresden Dolls''' is an American musical duo from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Formed in 2000, the group consists of [[Amanda Palmer]] (lead vocals and piano; additional: keyboards, harmonica, ukulele) and [[Brian Viglione]] (drums and backing vocals; additional: guitar, bass guitar). The two describe their style as \"[[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] [[punk rock|punk]] [[cabaret]]\", a phrase invented by Palmer because she was \"terrified\" that the press would invent a name that \"would involve the word ''[[Goth subculture|gothic]]''\". The Dresden Dolls aesthetic exemplifies [[dark cabaret]].",
