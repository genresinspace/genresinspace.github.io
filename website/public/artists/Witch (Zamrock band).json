  "description": "'''Witch''' (often stylized as '''WITCH''' or '''W.I.T.C.H.''') are a [[Zamrock]] band formed in the 1970s. Widely seen as the most popular Zambian band of the 1970s, WITCH (a [[backronym]] for \"We Intend To Cause Havoc\"), was headed by lead vocalist Emanuel \"Jagari\" Chanda. The band formed during [[History of Zambia#Independence|Zambia's post-independence golden days]], but by the late 1970s, economic collapse and increasing government authoritarianism saw WITCH, like most Zamrock bands, fading away. The band was revived in 2012 after reissues of their records became popular abroad.",
