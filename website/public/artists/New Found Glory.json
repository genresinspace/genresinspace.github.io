During their lengthy [[New Found Glory discography|recording career]], the band have released twelve [[studio album]]s, one [[live album]], two [[Extended play|EP]]s, and four [[cover album]]s.\n\nAfter forming in 1997, New Found Glory released their debut studio album ''[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (album)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]'' in 1999. The band then released their [[New Found Glory (album)|self-titled major label debut]] in 2000, with the album's song \"[[Hit or Miss (New Found Glory song)|Hit or Miss]]\" peaking at number 15 the [[Alternative Songs]] chart. In 2002, the band became mainstream with their album ''[[Sticks and Stones (New Found Glory album)|Sticks and Stones]]'' and the album's hit \"[[My Friends Over You]]\". The group's popularity continued with their 2004 album ''[[Catalyst (New Found Glory album)|Catalyst]]'', of which the video for \"[[All Downhill From Here]]\" was nominated for a [[MTV Video Music Award|VMA]] for Breakthrough Video of the Year. Led by single \"[[It's Not Your Fault]]\", the mid-tempo and critically acclaimed ''[[Coming Home (New Found Glory album)|Coming Home]]'' followed in 2006. The release showcased a temporary move to an [[alternative rock]] style instead of their usual pop punk sound. The quintet returned to their energetic roots with the release of ''[[Not Without a Fight]]'' in 2009. They have since released four more albums; ''[[Radiosurgery (album)|Radiosurgery]]'' in 2011, ''[[Resurrection (New Found Glory album)|Resurrection]]'' in 2014, ''[[Makes Me Sick]]'' in 2017, and their tenth studio album ''[[Forever + Ever x Infinity]]'' in 2020.\n\nEmerging as part of the [[pop punk#Second wave and mainstream peak (1999â€“2005)|second wave of pop punk]] in the late 1990s, music critics consider them a key pioneer of the genre. Often labelled the \"godfathers of pop punk\", [[AllMusic]] notes how their \"raucous, fast-paced anthems carried them through the decades\", whilst crediting them for \"practically serving alongside the work of [[Blink-182]] as the blueprint to the entire genre for the early 2000s.\" ''[[Rock Sound]]'' have championed their \"classic sugar sweet sound\", which combines \"pop-punk and hardcore in one neat package.\" ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' have praised the group for their \"innovative and entirely irresistible fusion of [[punk rock|punk melodies]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore breakdowns]].\" As such, the band is considered highly influential in the development of the subgenre [[easycore]].",
