  "description": "'''Oasis''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Manchester]] in 1991. The group initially consisted of [[Liam Gallagher]] (lead vocals), [[Paul Arthurs|Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs]] (guitar), [[Paul McGuigan (musician)|Paul \"Guigsy\" McGuigan]] (bass guitar) and [[Tony McCarroll]] (drums). Liam asked his older brother [[Noel Gallagher]] (lead guitar, vocals) to join as a fifth member a few months later to finalise their formation. Noel became the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the group and took over the songwriting duties for the band's first four studio albums. They are regarded as one of the defining and most globally successful groups of the [[Britpop]] genre.\n\nOasis signed to independent record label [[Creation Records]] in 1993 and released their record-setting debut studio album ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), which topped the [[UK Albums Chart]] and quickly became the fastest-selling debut album in British history at the time. The following year, they released ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995) with new drummer [[Alan White (Oasis drummer)|Alan \"Whitey\" White]] in the midst of a highly publicised chart rivalry with peers [[Blur (band)|Blur]], dubbed by the British media as the \"[[Battle of Britpop]]\". Spending ten weeks at number one on the British charts, ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?'' was also an international chart success and became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|fifth-best-selling album in the UK]] and the [[List of best-selling albums of the 1990s in the United Kingdom|best-selling album in the UK of the 1990s]]. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid newspapers]] throughout the 1990s for their public disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their highly anticipated third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'', which became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history but retrospectively was seen as a critical disappointment.\n\nFounding members Arthurs and McGuigan left in 1999 during the recording of the band's fourth studio album ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'' (2000). They were replaced by former [[Heavy Stereo]] guitarist [[Gem Archer]] on guitar and former [[Ride (band)|Ride]] guitarist [[Andy Bell (Welsh musician)|Andy Bell]] on bass guitar. White departed in 2004, replaced by guest drummer [[Zak Starkey]], and later by [[Chris Sharrock]]. Oasis released three more studio albums in the 2000s: ''[[Heathen Chemistry]]'' (2002), ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008). The group abruptly disbanded in 2009 after the sudden departure of Noel Gallagher. The remaining members of the band continued under the name [[Beady Eye]] until their disbandment in 2014. Both Gallagher brothers have since had successful solo careers. In 2024, Oasis announced that they would reform in 2025 for worldwide performances as part of the [[Oasis Live '25 Tour]]. The band currently consists of the Gallagher brothers, Arthurs, Archer and Bell alongside guest musicians [[Christian Madden]] and [[Joey Waronker]].\n\nAs of 2022, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time. They are among the most successful acts in the history of the [[UK singles chart]] and the [[UK Albums Chart]], with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums. The band also achieved three [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)-certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] albums in the US. They won 17 [[NME Awards|''NME'' Awards]], nine [[Q Awards]], four [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] and six [[Brit Awards]], including one in 2007 for [[Brit Awards|Outstanding Contribution to Music]] and one for the \"Best Album of the Last 30 Years\" for ''(What's the Story) Morning Glory?''. They were also nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s.",
