AJR has released three more [[indie pop]] EPs—''[[Infinity (AJR EP)|Infinity]]'' (2014), ''[[What Everyone's Thinking]]'' (2016), and ''[[What No One's Thinking]]'' (2025)—since the song was released on ''[[6foot1]]'' (2013) as well as the [[reissue]] ''I'm Ready EP'' (2014).\n\nAt their home studio, AJR has written or co-written every song in their [[AJR discography#Studio albums|five-album discography]]: ''[[Living Room (AJR album)|Living Room]]'' (2015); ''[[The Click (album)|The Click]]'' (2017); the two U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] top-ten albums—''[[Neotheater]]'' (2019), ''[[OK Orchestra]]'' (2021); and ''[[The Maybe Man]]'' (2023).
