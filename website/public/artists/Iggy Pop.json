  "description": "'''James Newell Osterberg Jr.''' (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as '''Iggy Pop''', is an American singer, musician, songwriter, actor and radio broadcaster. He was the vocalist and lyricist of [[proto-punk]] band [[the Stooges]], who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since. Often called the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godfather of Punk]]\", he was named one of the ''[[50 Great Voices]]'' by [[NPR]] due to his distinctive voice. In 2010, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Stooges. Pop also received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2020 for his solo work.  Throughout his career, he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics, poetic lyrics and unique voice.\n\nInitially playing a raw, primitive style of [[rock and roll]] (progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of [[self-mutilation]] by Pop. He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with [[David Bowie]] over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album ''[[Raw Power]]'' in 1973. Both musicians went to [[West Berlin]] to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]'' and ''[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop album)|Lust for Life]]'', Pop usually contributing the lyrics. He was one of the first performers to do a [[stage-dive]] and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and stage diving. \n\nPop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including [[garage rock]], [[punk rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[art rock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[grunge]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]]. Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including \"[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]\" and \"[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]\" by the Stooges, and his solo hits \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\", \"[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]\" and \"[[Real Wild Child (Wild One)]]\". In 1990, he recorded his only Top 40 U.S. hit, \"[[Candy (Iggy Pop song)|Candy]]\", a duet with [[the B-52s]]' singer [[Kate Pierson]]. Pop's song \"[[China Girl (song)|China Girl]]\" became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album, ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop's songs throughout his career.\n\nAlthough Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges' album ''Raw Power'' has proved an influence on artists such as [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Smiths]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. His solo album ''The Idiot'' has been cited as a major influence on a number of [[post-punk]], electronic and [[industrial music|industrial]] artists including [[Depeche Mode]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Joy Division]], and was described by [[Siouxsie Sioux]] as a \"re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius.\"",
