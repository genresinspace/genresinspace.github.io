  "description": "'''Gorillaz''' are an English [[virtual band]] created by musician [[Damon Albarn]] and artist [[Jamie Hewlett]] in [[London, England]] in 1998. The band primarily consists of four fictional members: {{Nowrap|2-D}} (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their universe is presented in media such as music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz's music has featured collaborations with a wide range of musicians and featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.\n\nWith Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct [[Britpop]] sound of his band [[Blur (band)|Blur]], exploring a variety of musical styles including [[hip hop]], [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[world music]]. The band's 2001 debut album, ''[[Gorillaz (album)|Gorillaz]]'', which features [[dub music|dub]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] influences, went [[BPI certification|triple platinum in the UK]] and [[Music recording certification#IFPI certification|double platinum in Europe]], with sales driven by the success of the lead single, \"[[Clint Eastwood (song)|Clint Eastwood]]\". Their second studio album, ''[[Demon Days]]'' (2005), went six times platinum in the UK, [[RIAA certification#Description and qualifications|double platinum in the US]], and spawned the successful lead single \"[[Feel Good Inc.]]\", along with other hits such as \"[[Dare (song)|DARE]]\", \"[[Dirty Harry (song)|Dirty Harry]]\" and \"[[El Mañana (song)|El Mañana]]\". The band's third album, ''[[Plastic Beach]]'' (2010), featured environmentalist themes, [[synth-pop]] elements and an expanded roster of featured artists such as Bobby Womack, Lou Reed and Little Dragon. Their fourth album, ''[[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]]'', was recorded on the road (mainly on Damon Albarn's iPad) during the [[Escape to Plastic Beach Tour]] and released on 25 December 2010.\n\nIn 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, [[Remi Kabaka Jr.]] became a permanent music producer for the band. Their fifth album, ''[[Humanz]]'' (2017) was the band's first in seven years and featured a wide array of guest artists, while its follow-up, ''[[The Now Now]]'' (2018), focused musically on Albarn. In 2020, Gorillaz started the ''[[Song Machine]]'' project, a music-based web series with episodes that consisted of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, which culminated with their seventh studio album, ''[[Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez]]'' (2020). The band's eighth studio album, ''[[Cracker Island]]'' (2023), met generally positive reviews as a refinement of their usual style.\n\nGorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout its history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and, since 2010, traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. They have won a [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Awards]], an [[NME Award]] and four [[MTV Europe Music Awards]]. They have also been nominated for 11 [[Brit Awards]] and won [[Brit Award for British Group|Best British Group]] at the [[2018 Brit Awards]].",
