  "description": "'''Caetano Emanuel Viana Teles Veloso''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|kajˈtɐnu emɐnuˈɛw viˈɐnɐ ˈtɛliz veˈlozu|lang}}; born 7 August 1942) is a Brazilian composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement [[Tropicália]], which encompassed theatre, [[poetry]] and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|Brazilian military dictatorship]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|took power]] in 1964. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nineteen [[Brazilian Music Awards]], nine [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]]. On 14 November, [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2012|2012]], Veloso was honored as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year]].\n\nVeloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Telles Veloso (commonly known as ''Seu Zeca''), a government official, and [[Dona Canô|Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso]] (known as ''Dona Canô''). He was born in the city of [[Santo Amaro da Purificação]], in [[Bahia]], a state in [[northeastern Brazil]], but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the originators of [[Tropicália]] with several like-minded musicians and artists—including his sister [[Maria Bethânia]]—in the same period. However, the Brazilian military dictatorship viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician [[Gilberto Gil]], in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.",
