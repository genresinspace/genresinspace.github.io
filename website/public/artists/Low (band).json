  "name": "Low",
  "description": "'''Low''' was an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Duluth, Minnesota]], formed in 1993 by Alan Sparhawk (guitar and vocals) and Mimi Parker (drums and vocals). The band was a trio from 1993 to 2020, having featured four different bassists. Low disbanded following the death of Parker in 2022.\n\nThe music of Low was characterized by slow [[tempo]]s and [[minimalist music|minimalist]] arrangements. Early descriptions sometimes referred to the band's style as a rock subgenre called \"[[slowcore]]\", and Low were often compared to the band [[Bedhead (band)|Bedhead]], who played this style during the early 1990s. However, Low's members ultimately disapproved of the term.\n\nParker and Sparhawk's [[close harmony|vocal harmonies]] represented perhaps the group's most distinctive element; critic [[Denise Sullivan]] writes that their shared vocals are \"as chilling as anything [[Gram Parsons|Gram [Parsons]]] and [[Emmylou Harris|Emmylou [Harris]]] ever conspired onâ€”though that's not to say it's [[country music|country]]-tinged, just straight from the heart.\" Low's style grew experimental over time, gradually incorporating elements of electronica and [[Glitch (music)|glitch music]] on later releases, while retaining their minimalist approach.",
