  "name": "Low",
  "description": "'''Low''' was an American [[indie rock]] band from [[Duluth, Minnesota]], formed in 1993 by the husband and wife duo of Alan Sparhawk (guitar and vocals) and Mimi Parker (drums and vocals). The band was a trio from 1993 to 2020, having featured four different bassists. Their early music was pioneering in the [[slowcore]] genre, usually featuring quiet harmony vocals, a melancholy mood, and very slow tempos compared to other styles of rock and roll. However, Low's sound gradually developed over time to touch on other influences. Low disbanded following the death of Parker in 2022.",
