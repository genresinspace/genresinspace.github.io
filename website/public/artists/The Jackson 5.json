The group was formed in [[Gary, Indiana]], in 1964, and originally consisted of brothers [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], and [[Michael Jackson|Michael]]. They were managed by their father [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joe Jackson]]. The group were among the first [[African Americans|African American]] performers to attain a [[Crossover music|crossover following]].{{Technical inline|date=September 2024}}\n\nThe Jackson 5 first performed in talent shows and clubs on the [[Chitlin' Circuit]] and eventually signed with [[Steeltown Records]] in 1967, under which their first two singles were released. In 1968, they left Steeltown and signed with [[Motown]], where they were the first group to debut with four consecutive number-one hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart with the songs \"[[I Want You Back]]\" (1969), \"[[ABC (The Jackson 5 song)|ABC]]\", \"[[The Love You Save]]\", and \"[[I'll Be There (Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]\" (all 1970). They achieved seventeen Top 40 singles on the chart in five years, including six number-one ''Billboard'' R&B hits. The group left Motown for [[Epic Records]] in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine, who was replaced by youngest brother [[Randy Jackson (Jacksons singer)|Randy]]. Changing their name to the Jacksons upon signing with Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums ''[[Destiny (The Jacksons album)|Destiny]]'' (1978) and ''[[Triumph (The Jacksons album)|Triumph]]'' (1980) and singles \"[[Enjoy Yourself (The Jacksons song)|Enjoy Yourself]]\" (1976), \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" (1978), \"[[This Place Hotel]]\" (1980), and \"[[Can You Feel It (The Jacksons song)|Can You Feel It]]\" (1981).\n\nThe brothers also embarked on solo careers, with Michael's being by far the most successful. In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on the ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' television special. They released the ''[[Victory (The Jacksons album)|Victory]]'' album the following year, followed by [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons)|an extensive tour]] which also featured songs from Michael's solo albums. After the ''Victory'' tour, Michael and Marlon left the group. The four remaining members released the poorly received ''[[2300 Jackson Street]]'' album in 1989 before being dropped from Epic. In 2001, the Jacksons reunited on Michael's [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration|30th Anniversary Celebration]] TV special. The four eldest of the brothers embarked on their [[Unity Tour]] in 2012 following [[Death of Michael Jackson|Michael's death]] in 2009, and they planned several major performances for 2017.\n\nThe Jackson 5/The Jacksons have sold over 150 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling artists of all time]].
