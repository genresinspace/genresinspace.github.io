  "description": "'''Gustavo Alfredo Santaolalla''' ({{IPA|es|ɡusˈtaβo alˈfɾeðo santaoˈlaʝa|lang}}; born 19 August 1951) is an Argentine composer, record producer and musician. He is the recipient of [[List of awards and nominations received by Gustavo Santaolalla|numerous accolades]] for [[List of works by Gustavo Santaolalla|his works]], including two [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], a [[Golden Globe]], two [[Grammy Awards]] and 17 [[Latin Grammy Awards]]. He is known for his minimalist approach to composing and for his influence in the [[Latin rock]] music genre.\n\nInvolved in music from a young age, he began a professional career in 1967 founding the band [[Arco Iris (band)|Arco Iris]], who were influential to the ''[[rock nacional]]'' genre. Fleeing the rule of the Argentine [[military junta]] and the dictatorship of the [[National Reorganization Process]], Santaolalla moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1978. After returning to Argentina in the 1980s and taking a musical sabbatical, he became a leading figure in the ''[[rock en español]]'' movement, establishing the record label [[Surco Records]] within [[Universal Music]] and producing records for over 100 artists. Notable records he produced were several from [[Café Tacuba]], including their acclaimed 1994 album ''[[Re (Café Tacuba album)|Re]]'', [[Julieta Venegas]]'s 2000 album ''[[Bueninvento]]'', and [[Juanes]]'s 2005 hit single \"[[La Camisa Negra]]\". Santaolalla established the [[neotango]] group [[Bajofondo]] in 2001.\n\nMusic from Santaolalla's 1998 solo album ''Ronroco'' caught the attention of filmmakers and led to a career expansion into film scores, beginning with ''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000), ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004). Santaolalla rose to fame for creating the scores for ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005) and ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006), for which he received two [[Academy Award]]s for Best Original Score in consecutive years. He scored ''[[I Come with the Rain]]'' (2009) and ''[[Biutiful]]'' (2010). Santaolalla further gained recognition for his work on ''[[The Last of Us]]'' game series, composing [[The Last of Us (video game)|the 2013 game]] and [[The Last of Us Part II|its 2020 sequel]]. In 2014, he composed his first animated film, ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', and his first Argentine film, ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]''. He scored the short film ''[[Borrowed Time (film)|Borrowed Time]]'' (2015) and co-composed the documentary ''[[Before the Flood (film)|Before the Flood]]'' (2016). Santaolalla returned to [[Music of The Last of Us (TV series)|adapt his music]] for the 2023 [[The Last of Us (TV series)| ''The Last of Us'' TV series]] and composed an original score for October 2024 showings of the 1931 Spanish-language ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dracula]]'' film by the [[Los Angeles Opera]].\n\nNot learned in reading or writing [[musical notation]], Santaolalla prefers composing his scores mostly by himself. Favouring instruments like the [[ronroco]], he adopts a minimalistic approach when composing and prefers to capture humanistic elements of performances. He compares his philosophy of favouring minimalism in music to [[parkour]], comparing the calculations of athletes before landing to his measured selection of [[musical notes]] before playing them. By contrast, his live performances have been noted for their vibrancy. For his influence in [[Latin music]], Santaolalla was recognized as a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] Icon during the 15th annual Latin Awards Ceremony in 2008 and received the [[Latin Grammy Trustees Award]] in 2023. In his personal life, he has two children with his wife, and is engaged with [[winemaking]].",
