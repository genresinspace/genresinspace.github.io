  "description": "'''The Blues Brothers''' are an American [[blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] [[revue]] band founded in 1978 by comedians [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[John Belushi]], who met and began collaborating as original cast members of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nThe Blues Brothers Musical Revue consisted of lead vocalist \"[[Joliet Correctional Center|Joliet]]\" Jake Blues (Belushi) and his brother, Elwood (Aykroyd), who played a [[harmonica]] that he carried onstage in a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. The duo were usually dressed in matching black suits, black pencil ties, black [[Trilby|trilby hats]] and sunglasses. The band itself was carefully constructed, and made up of experienced musicians of the time, including [[Steve Cropper|Steve \"The Colonel\" Cropper]], [[Donald \"Duck\" Dunn]], [[Matt \"Guitar\" Murphy]], [[Lou Marini|\"Blue\" Lou Marini]], [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom \"Bones\" Malone]], and [[Alan Rubin|Alan \"Mr. Fabulous\" Rubin]].\n\nThe act debuted as musical guest on the April 22, 1978, episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', hosted by comedian [[Steve Martin]]. After recruiting a full band, the group opened for Martin during a residency at the Universal Amphitheatre in September 1978.  Recordings from that performance were released on November 28 as a live album, ''[[Briefcase Full of Blues]]''. The album rose to the top of the charts and was a platinum seller. Several subsequent albums followed. The act opened for the [[Grateful Dead]] at the closing of [[Winterland Ballroom|Winterland Arena]] in San Francisco, and gained further fame after spawning the comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in 1980. They remain the most successful blues revue act of all time.\n\nBelushi died in 1982, but the Blues Brothers continued to perform with a rotation of guest singers and other band members. The band re-formed in 1988 for a world tour and again in 1998 for the sequel film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.",
