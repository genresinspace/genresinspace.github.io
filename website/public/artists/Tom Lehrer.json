  "description": "'''Thomas Andrew Lehrer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛər|ər}}; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, [[singer-songwriter]], [[satirist]], and mathematician, who later taught mathematics and musical theater. He recorded pithy and humorous, often [[Music and politics|political songs]] that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is \"[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]\", in which he set the names of the [[chemical element]]s to the tune of the \"[[Major-General's Song]]\" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]''.\n\nLehrer's early performances dealt with non-topical subjects and [[black humor]] (also known as dark comedy) in songs such as \"[[Poisoning Pigeons in the Park]]\". In the 1960s, he produced songs about timely social and political issues, particularly for the U.S. version of the television show ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]''. The popularity of these songs has far outlasted their topical subjects and references. Lehrer quoted a friend's explanation: \"Always predict the worst and you'll be hailed as a prophet.\" In the early 1970s, Lehrer largely retired from public performance to devote his time to teaching mathematics and musical theater history at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].",
