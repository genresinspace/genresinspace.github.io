  "description": "'''Black Sabbath''' were an English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Birmingham]] in 1968 by guitarist [[Tony Iommi]], drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], bassist [[Geezer Butler]] and vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. After adopting the Black Sabbath name in 1969 (the band were previously named Polka Tulk Blues Band and then Earth), they distinguished themselves through [[occult]] themes with horror-inspired lyrics and [[down-tuned guitars]]. Their first three albums, ''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'', ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (both 1970), and ''[[Master of Reality]]'' (1971), were commercially successful, and are cited as pioneering albums in the development of heavy metal. Subsequent albums ''[[Vol. 4 (Black Sabbath album)|Vol. 4]]'' (1972), ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]'' (1973), ''[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Sabotage]]'' (1975), ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'' (1976), and ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' (1978) saw the band explore more [[Experimental music|experimental]] and [[Progressive rock|progressive]] styles.\n\nOsbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 and replaced by former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] vocalist [[Ronnie James Dio]], who recorded three albums with the band, ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1980), ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' (1981), and their first authorised live album ''[[Live Evil (Black Sabbath album)|Live Evil]]'' (1983), the last two featuring drummer [[Vinny Appice]] replacing Ward. Following Dio and Appice's departures, Iommi and Butler recorded ''[[Born Again (Black Sabbath album)|Born Again]]'' (1983) with Ward returning on drums, and [[Ian Gillan]], then-formerly of [[Deep Purple]], on vocals. By 1984, Butler, Ward, and Gillan had all departed, leaving Iommi to assemble a new version of Black Sabbath. For the next thirteen years, the band endured many personnel changes that included vocalists [[Glenn Hughes (English musician)|Glenn Hughes]] (another former Deep Purple member, who sang on Black Sabbath's 1986 album ''[[Seventh Star]]''){{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=247}} and [[Tony Martin (British singer)|Tony Martin]], as well as several bassists and drummers. Of the vocalists during these years, Martin's tenure was the longest, joining in 1987 and recording three albums – ''[[The Eternal Idol]]'' (1987),{{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=256}} ''[[Headless Cross (album)|Headless Cross]]'' (1989),{{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=269}} and ''[[Tyr (album)|Tyr]]'' (1990) – before his initial departure in 1991.{{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=279}} That same year, Iommi reunited with Butler, Dio and Appice to record ''[[Dehumanizer]]'' (1992), though Dio and Appice both departed again by the end of 1992. Martin returned for two more studio albums, ''[[Cross Purposes]]'' (1994){{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=291}} and ''[[Forbidden (Black Sabbath album)|Forbidden]]'' (1995),{{sfn|Iommi|2012|p=297}} and one live album, ''[[Cross Purposes Live]]'' (1995), before the band went on a one-year hiatus.\n\nThe original line-up of Iommi, Osbourne, Butler and Ward reunited in 1997, releasing a live album, ''[[Reunion (Black Sabbath album)|Reunion]]'' (1998), and touring sporadically until 2005. The band went on hiatus the following year when the ''Mob Rules'' line-up (Iommi, Butler, Dio, Appice) reunited as [[Heaven & Hell (band)|Heaven & Hell]], touring during the late 2000s and releasing one studio album, ''[[The Devil You Know (Heaven & Hell album)|The Devil You Know]]'' (2009), before disbanding after Dio's death in 2010. The original line-up reunited again in 2011, though Ward departed prior to the recording of their final studio album ''[[13 (Black Sabbath album)|13]]'' (2013). To conclude their [[The End Tour|farewell tour]], Black Sabbath played its [[The End: Live in Birmingham|last concert]] for eight years in their home city in 2017. Occasional partial reunions have occurred, most notably when Osbourne and Iommi performed at the closing ceremony of the [[2022 Commonwealth Games]] in Birmingham. The original line-up reunited for a final show for both the band and Osbourne as a solo artist, titled [[Back to the Beginning]], at [[Villa Park]] on 5 July 2025; Osbourne died seventeen days after the performance.\n\nBlack Sabbath had sold over 70 million records as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. The band have been referred to as being part of the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\", along with Deep Purple and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Black Sabbath were ranked by [[MTV]] as the \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\" and placed second on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them 85 on its \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". They were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005 and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2006. They have won two [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]], and received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].",
