  "description": "'''Edgardo Armando Franco''' (born 27 September 1969), better known as '''El General''', is a Panamanian former reggae artist considered by some to be one of the fathers of ''[[Reggae en Español|reggae en Español]].''\n\nDuring the early 1990s, he was one of the artists who initiated the Spanish-language [[dancehall]] variety of reggae music. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, \"Te Ves Buena\" and \"Tu Pum Pum\". “Tu Pum Pum\" emerged after a friend of El General invited him to collaborate with a Jamaican producer that was searching for a “different sound in Panama.\" Both songs, performed in Spanish [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]] style, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish-language dancehall reggae artists became famous in the mainstream as well. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of [[dance music]] and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America.\n\nEl General retired from music in 2004 and became one of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].",
