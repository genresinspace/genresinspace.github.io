His 1985 compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits – Volume I & Volume II]]'', is one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United States|best-selling albums in the United States]].\n\nJoel was born in [[the Bronx]] in [[New York City]] and grew up in [[Hicksville, New York|Hicksville]] on [[Long Island]], where he began taking piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, [[the Hassles]] and [[Attila (rock band)|Attila]], before signing a record deal with Family Productions and embarking on a solo career with his debut album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor (album)|Cold Spring Harbor]]'' (1971). In 1972, Joel caught the attention of [[Columbia Records]] after a live radio performance of \"[[Captain Jack (Billy Joel song)|Captain Jack]]\" became popular in [[Philadelphia]], prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company, through which he released his second album, ''[[Piano Man (Billy Joel album)|Piano Man]]'' (1973). After ''[[Streetlife Serenade]]'' (1974) and ''[[Turnstiles (album)|Turnstiles]]'' (1976), Joel achieved his critical and commercial breakthrough with ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'' (1977). It became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning the hit singles \"[[Just the Way You Are (Billy Joel song)|Just the Way You Are]]\", \"[[Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)]]\", \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\", and \"[[She's Always a Woman]]\", as well as the concert staples \"[[Scenes from an Italian Restaurant]]\" and \"[[Vienna (Billy Joel song)|Vienna]]\".\n\nJoel's ''[[52nd Street (album)|52nd Street]]'' (1978) was his first album to reach No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. ''[[Glass Houses (album)|Glass Houses]]'' (1980) was an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; it featured \"[[It's Still Rock and Roll to Me]]\" (Joel's first single to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]), \"[[You May Be Right]]\", \"[[Don't Ask Me Why (Billy Joel song)|Don't Ask Me Why]]\", and \"[[Sometimes a Fantasy]]\". ''[[The Nylon Curtain]]'' (1982) stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. ''[[An Innocent Man]]'' (1983) served as an homage to genres of music that Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as [[rhythm and blues]] and [[doo-wop]]; it featured \"[[Tell Her About It]]\", \"[[Uptown Girl]]\", and \"[[The Longest Time]]\", three of his best-known songs. After ''[[River of Dreams]]'' (1993), he largely retired from producing studio material, although he went on to release ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'' (2001), featuring classical compositions composed by him and performed by British-Korean pianist [[Richard Hyung-ki Joo]]. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] [[animated film]] ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', performing the song \"Why Should I Worry?\", and contributed to the soundtracks to several films, including ''[[Easy Money (1983 film)|Easy Money]]'' (1983), ''[[Ruthless People]]'' (1986), and ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]'' (1992). Joel returned to composing new music with the 2024 single “[[Turn the Lights Back On]]”.\n\nJoel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the [[Soviet Union]]. Joel has had 33 Top 40 hits in the U.S., three of which (\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\", \"Tell Her About It\", and \"[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]\") topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.
