  "name": "Admonish",
  "description": "'''Admonish''' is a Swedish [[unblack metal]] band formed in 1994. They were one of the first bands in the [[Christian black metal]] movement and the first Christian black metal group in Sweden. While the band did not release anything until 2005, the magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' called Admonish \"One of the leading Christian black metal bands\" in a 1990s issue which focused on black metal. In 2006 Admonish achieved some mainstream notice when the twins Emil (guitar) and Jonas Karlsson (bass) both appeared on the MTV Europe show ''[[Pimp My Ride]] International'' on 6 October. On that show, in which their car was modified, the twins advertised their band and Admonish's music was played. The former Admonish member Per Sundberg was also a guitar-player in [[Crimson Moonlight]].",
