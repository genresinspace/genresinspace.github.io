Her [[contemporary folk music]] often includes songs of protest and [[social justice]]. Baez has performed publicly for over 60 years, releasing more than 30 albums.\n\nBaez is generally regarded as a [[folk singer]], but her music has diversified since the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture era of the 1960s]] and encompasses genres such as [[folk rock]], pop, [[Country music|country]], and [[gospel music]]. She began her recording career in 1960 and achieved immediate success. Her first three albums, ''[[Joan Baez (album)|Joan Baez]]'', ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]'' and ''[[Joan Baez in Concert]]'', all achieved [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] status. Although a songwriter herself, Baez generally interprets others' work, having recorded many traditional songs and songs written by [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[the Beatles]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Bob Marley]], and many others. She was one of the first major artists to record songs by [[Bob Dylan]] in the early 1960s; Baez was already an internationally celebrated artist and did much to popularize his early songwriting efforts. Her tumultuous relationship with Dylan later became the subject of songs by each of them and generated much public speculation. On her later albums she has found success interpreting the work of more recent songwriters, including [[Ryan Adams]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Natalie Merchant]], and [[Joe Henry]].\n\nBaez's songs include \"[[Diamonds & Rust (song)|Diamonds & Rust]]\" and [[cover version|covers]] of [[Phil Ochs]]'s \"[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]\" and [[the Band]]'s \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\". She also recorded \"[[Farewell, Angelina (song)|Farewell, Angelina]]\", \"[[Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word]]\", \"[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]\", \"[[Here's to You (song)|Here's to You]]\", \"[[Joe Hill (song)|Joe Hill]]\", \"[[Sweet Sir Galahad]]\" and \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\". Baez performed fourteen songs at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] and has displayed a lifelong commitment to political and social activism in the fields of [[nonviolence]], [[civil rights]], [[Human rights activist|human rights]], and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Baez was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on April 7, 2017.",
