  "description": "'''Gelson Caio Manuel Mendes''', better known as '''Nagrelha''' (1986 – November 18, 2022), was an Angolan musician. He was a pioneer of the [[kuduro]] genre and one of its best-known stars.\n\nBorn in the [[Luanda]] neighbourhood of [[Sambizanga]], Nagrelha grew up in a tough environment, where he experienced gang violence, drug abuse, and stints in jail. His group, [[Os Lambas]], released their first major hit, 'Comboio', in 2006, and proceeded to become one of the most renowned of all [[kuduro]] acts. According to [[Kalaf Epalanga]], founding member of the Portuguese group [[Buraka Som Sistema]], the video for 'Comboio' \"marks a before and an after in music video production in Angola\"; it is said to have \"defined kuduro’s visual esthetics\".\n\nNagrelha was a lifelong supporter of the [[MPLA]], the political party that has ruled Angola since independence, and frequently performed at party functions. [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], president of Angola from 1979 to 2017, was also from Nagrelha's neighborhood of Sambizanga.  \n\nNagrelha died in 2022 from [[lung cancer]] at the age of 36. His funeral was attended by over 20,000 people; there were a number of looting incidents and at least one death, and mourners were dispersed by police using tear gas. Many reports contrasted the massive outpouring of grief for Nagrelha with the relatively subdued funeral of ex-president [[José Eduardo dos Santos|dos Santos]] just a few months before.",
