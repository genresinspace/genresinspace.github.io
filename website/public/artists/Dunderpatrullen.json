  "description": "'''Dunderpatrullen''' is a Swedish electronic music group from [[Östersund]], [[Jämtland]].  Their music is mostly based in the [[bitpop]] sub-genre of chiptune, but has deviated into other territories such as [[synthwave]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]. Much of their inspiration comes from classic [[Retrogaming|retro video game]] composition, often referencing and basing composition off of classic [[chiptune]] techniques in a modern context.  The band has found success within the gaming enthusiast sphere, playing for events such as [[DreamHack]] and [[NärCon]].\n\nAs of 2016, the band is under their own label, after previously being under Beard Monster AB of Warner Music Sweden.\n\nThey released their first album in 2007, the year after the band was formed, titled ''For Great Justice''.  Three years later in 2010, they would release their second, ''Analoga Steroider,'' followed up by ''Keygeneration'' in 2014.  Since then, they are still producing music, turning to a singles release method before compiling the released songs into their next studio album.  The first single of this series was released in 2019 titled Arcadia.",
