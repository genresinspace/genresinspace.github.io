  "description": "'''Henry Cow''' were an English [[experimental rock]] [[Musical ensemble|group]], founded at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1968 by multi-instrumentalists [[Fred Frith]] and [[Tim Hodgkinson]]. Henry Cow's personnel fluctuated over their decade together, but drummer [[Chris Cutler]], bassist [[John Greaves (musician)|John Greaves]], and bassoonist/oboist [[Lindsay Cooper]] were important long-term members alongside Frith and Hodgkinson.\n\nAn inherent anti-commercial attitude kept them at arm's length from the mainstream [[music business]], enabling them to experiment at will. Critic Myles Boisen writes, \"[their sound] was so mercurial and daring that they had few imitators, even though they inspired many on both sides of the Atlantic with a blend of spontaneity, intricate structures, philosophy, and humor that has endured and transcended the '[[progressive rock|progressive]]' tag.\"\n\nWhile it was generally thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer [[Henry Cowell]], this has been repeatedly denied by band members.{{sfn|Cutler|2009a|p=21}} According to Hodgkinson, the name \"Henry Cow\" was \"in the air\" in 1968, and it seemed like a good name for the band. It had no connection to anything.{{sfn|Cutler|2006|p=6}} In a 1974 interview, Cutler said the name was chosen because \"[i]t's silly. What could be sillier than Henry Cow?\"",
