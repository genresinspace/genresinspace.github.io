  "description": "'''Moheener Ghoraguli''' ({{Langx|bn|মহীনের ঘোড়াগুলি}}, literally \"Ocean's horses\" or Seahorses) was an Indian rock group from [[Kolkata]], established in 1975.{{r|Pattanayak}} Their music drew from a wide variety of influences, including Bengali folk, [[Baul]], urban American folk, and [[jazz]].{{r|Pattanayak}} They sometimes described their style as \"Baul jazz.\"\n\nEstablished in the 1970s during a period of stagnation in Bengali music, when commercial film songs were the dominant market force, the lyrics and music (and to some extent the compositions) of Moheener Ghoraguli with its leader [[Gautam Chattopadhyay]] were radically new. They were of a very personal or social nature, similar to the urban folk movement led by [[Bob Dylan]] in the 60s. Though they were almost unknown in their time, in recent years they have undergone a critical re-evaluation. The band disbanded in 1981.\n\nIn the 1990s, Gautam released a compilation of \"Moheener Ghoraguli Sampadito\" albums, including songs that were written and composed by Gautam Chattopadhyay himself and by other contemporary artistes and a few old songs of Moheener Ghoraguli. The albums were ''[[Aabaar Bochhor Kuri Pore]]'' in 1995, ''[[Jhora Somoyer Gaan]]'' (1996), Maya in 1998 and [[Khyapar Gaan]] in 1999.",
