  "description": "'''The Turtles''' were an [[America]]n [[Band (rock and pop)|rock band]] formed in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] in 1965. The band achieved several [[Top 40]] hits throughout the latter half of the 1960s, including \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\" (1965), \"[[You Baby (song)|You Baby]]\" (1966), \"[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]\" (1967), \"[[She'd Rather Be with Me]]\" (1967), \"[[Elenore]]\" (1968), and \"[[You Showed Me]]\" (1969), with \"Happy Together\" reaching number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThe group originally consisted of lead vocalist [[Howard Kaylan]], backing vocalist [[Mark Volman]], lead guitarist Al Nichol, rhythm guitarist Jim Tucker, bassist Chuck Portz, and drummer [[Don Murray (drummer)|Don Murray]], with subsequent members being bassists [[Chip Douglas]] and [[Jim Pons]], and drummers [[Joel Larson]], [[John Barbata|Johnny Barbata]], and [[John Seiter]].\n\nAs the Turtles' commercial success waned by the end of the 1960s, they became plagued with management problems, lawsuits and conflicts with their label, [[White Whale Records]], leading the group to break up in 1970. Kaylan and Volman (alongside Pons) then joined [[Frank Zappa]]'s band, [[the Mothers of Invention]], where, for contractual reasons, they performed under the name [[Flo & Eddie]] (Volman as \"Flo\", Kaylan as \"Eddie\"). After leaving Zappa at the end of 1971, Kaylan and Volman continued to perform under the Flo & Eddie name, becoming popular as a [[comedy rock]] act, and also went on to long-lasting success as [[session musician]]s for artists including [[John Lennon]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], and [[Alice Cooper]]. In 1983, Kaylan and Volman began touring as '''The Turtles featuring Flo & Eddie'''. Kaylan ceased touring in 2018, while Volman continued to tour with the Turtles until his death in September 2025, with [[Ron Dante]] (previously of [[The Archies]]) replacing Kaylan.",
