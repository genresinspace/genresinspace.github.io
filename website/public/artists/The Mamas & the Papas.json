The group was a defining force in the music scene of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Formed in New York City, the group consisted of Americans [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Cass Elliot]], and [[Michelle Phillips]], and Canadian [[Denny Doherty]]. Their sound was based on vocal harmonies arranged by John Phillips – the songwriter and leader of the group – who adapted folk to the new [[Beat music|beat]] style of the early 1960s.\n\nThe Mamas & the Papas released five studio albums and 17 singles, six of which made the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' top 10, and has sold close to 40 million records worldwide. After their break-up in 1968, the band reunited briefly to record the album ''[[People Like Us (The Mamas & the Papas album)|People Like Us]]'' in 1971 but split again shortly after the album was released. They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1998 for their contributions to the music industry, and they reunited for the second and final time to perform at the induction ceremony that year, during which Elliot's daughter Owen filled in for her late mother, who had died in 1974.",
