Battiato's songs explore many themes (including, but not limited to, [[philosophy]], art, [[spirituality]], science, introspection, innovation, [[Western esotericism|esotericism]], religiousness), and have spanned genres such as [[experimental pop]], [[electronic music]], [[minimal music|minimalism]], [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]], [[progressive rock]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[symphonic music]], [[sound collage]], [[opera]], [[oratorio]] and [[movie soundtrack]].\n\nHe was for decades one of the most popular singer-songwriters in Italy. His unique sound, song-crafting and especially his lyrics (often containing philosophical, intellectual and culturally exotic references, as well as tackling universal themes about the human condition) earned him a unique spot on Italy's music scene, and the nickname of \"[[Maestro|Il Maestro]]\". His work includes songwriting and joint production efforts with several Italian and international musicians and pop singers, including the long-lasting professional relationship with Italian singers [[Alice (singer)|Alice]] and [[Giuni Russo]]. Together with Alice, Battiato represented Italy at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song \"[[I treni di Tozeur]]\".",
