Nando Boom's new and speedy music style has influenced heavily the evolution of Latin music over the past few years as one of the fathers of reggae en Espa침ol. \nHis ''vm grinding'' dance moves have also changed the way people dance since the mid-1990s. This backwards dancing style is now the representative dancing of reggaeton listeners.\nHis most popular songs are \"A Danzar\" and \"Esa Chica Me Vacila\", still one of the main songs played in nightclubs all over Latin America.\n\nFor many fans and critics he is considered to be a pioneer of [[reggaeton]] and one of the most important figures in reggae en Espa침ol.\n\nThe band received the Caracol of the Caribbean award from Colombia in 1992 and a Stefano award in Miami in 1994.\n\nNando Boom has released songs with homophobic lyrics, such as the song \"No queremos mariflor\". He was then criticized by the [[LGBT rights in Panama|gay community of Panama]].",
