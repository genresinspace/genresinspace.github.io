  "name": "Tha Dogg Pound",
  "description": "'''Tha Dogg Pound''' is an American [[hip-hop]] duo composed of West Coast rappers [[Kurupt]] and [[Daz Dillinger]]. They were among the first acts to sign to [[Death Row Records]] in 1992.\n\nKurupt and Daz went on to release solo albums starting in 1998; they left the crumbling Death Row Records following year. Daz left due to long-lasting internal struggles on the label after friend and labelmate [[Tupac Shakur]]'s [[Murder of Tupac Shakur|murder]] in 1996. Kurupt started Antra Records, while Daz and Soopafly started [[D.P.G. Recordz]]. In 2002, a feud arose between the two when Kurupt decided to sign back with Death Row Records, upsetting everyone involved with the group. His awaited Death Row release ''[[Against the Grain (Kurupt album)|Against the Grain]]'' had been postponed several times while Kurupt was on the label, later being released in August 2005, after he was off. In January 2005, Daz made another solo album release titled ''[[Tha Dogg Pound Gangsta LP]]''. Tha Dogg Pound then got back together as a group and released ''Dillinger & Young Gotti II'' in November 2005. In 2006, [[Snoop Dogg]] executive produced released their official reunion album ''[[Cali Iz Active]]''.",
