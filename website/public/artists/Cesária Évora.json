Her songs were often devoted to themes of love, homesickness, nostalgia, and the history of the Cape Verdean people. She was known for performing barefoot and for her habit of smoking and drinking on stage during intermissions. Évora's music has received many accolades, including a [[Grammy Award]] in 2004, and it has influenced many Cape Verde diaspora musicians as well as American pop singer [[Madonna]]. Évora is also known as Cize, the Barefoot Diva, and the Queen of Morna.\n\nGrowing up in poverty, Évora began her singing career in local bars at age sixteen. She saw relative popularity within Cape Verde over the following years, but she retired from singing when it did not provide her with enough money to care for her children. Évora returned to music in 1985, when she contributed to a women's music anthology album in Portugal. There, she met music producer José \"Djô\" da Silva, who signed Évora to his record label, [[Lusafrica]]. She released her debut album, ''[[La Diva Aux Pieds Nus]]'', in 1988. Évora saw worldwide success after releasing her fourth and fifth albums: ''[[Miss Perfumado]]'' (1992) and ''[[Cesária]]'' (1995). She developed health problems in the late 2000s and died from [[respiratory failure]] and [[hypertension]] in 2011.",
