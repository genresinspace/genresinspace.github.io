He is one of the few Croatian musicians who performed at major international venues such as [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Royal Albert Hall]], [[Olympia (Paris)|L'Olympia]], and [[Sydney Opera House]].\n\nDue to his popularity in Croatian music and his impact on Dalmatian music, he is often regarded as the \"greatest musician in Croatian history\", and his music videos on [[YouTube]] have accumulated more than 700 million views.
