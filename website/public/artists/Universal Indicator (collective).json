  "name": "Universal Indicator",
  "description": "'''Universal Indicator''' is the group name for [[Rephlex Records]] artists [[Aphex Twin|Richard D. James]] (as Martin Tressider) and [[Mike Dred]] (a.k.a. The Kosmik Kommando). [[Universal Indicator|The name]] is a reference to the signature [[acid techno]] sound found on all the releases. Five projects were released, and a compilation CD was mixed by Dred.\n\nAll the albums are named after different colours used on the [[Universal Indicator|UI]] spectrum. Their catalog numbers reference [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] synthesizers: the [[Roland TB-303|TB-303]], the [[Roland TR-606|TR-606]], the [[Roland MC-202|MC-202]], and the [[Roland SH-101|SH-101]]. They were released in the following order: ''[[Universal Indicator Blue|Blue]]'', ''Red'', ''Yellow'', and ''[[Universal Indicator Green|Green]].'' ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'' were produced by Dred, while ''Red'' and ''Green'' are often attributed to James, though never officially. A fifth, released directly under Mike Dred's alias, expands the colour spectrum theme beyond the visible spectrum into ''Ultra-Violet''.",
