He was the founder of Banyuhay, a \"[[protest band]]\" that carried the trademark sound of the ''[[kubing]]'', a native musical instrument in the Philippines. His compositions were described as a \"unique synthesis of rock and blues, and Philippine ethnic rhythms\". Bartolome's song \"Nena\" became a hit in 1977.  His song \"Tayo'y Mga Pinoy\" (\"''We're Filipinos''\") was a finalist during the 1978 first [[Metro Manila Popular Music Festival]].",
