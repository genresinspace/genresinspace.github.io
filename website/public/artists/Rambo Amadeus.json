  "description": "'''Antonije Pušić''' ({{Cyrl|Антоније Пушић}}; born 14 June 1963), known professionally as '''Rambo Amadeus''' ({{Cyrl|Рамбо Амадеус}}), is an author and performer. A self-titled \"musician, poet, and media manipulator\", he is a noted artist across the countries of [[former Yugoslavia]].\n\nHis songs combine [[satirical]] lyrics on [[human nature]] and the silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[hip-hop]] and lately {{When|date=June 2025}} [[drum and bass]], and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car\" (\"Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar\"), formerly \"Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car\" (\"Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar\") (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from [[John Rambo]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].\n\nHis concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of [[free improvisation]] and satirical humor exploiting all aspects of [[human nature]] in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style with [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].\n\nRambo Amadeus [[Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|represented Montenegro]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], with the song \"[[Euro Neuro]]\".",
