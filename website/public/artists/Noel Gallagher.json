  "name": "Noel Gallagher",
  "description": "'''Noel Thomas David Gallagher''' (born 29 May 1967) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. Gallagher is the primary songwriter, lead guitarist and a co-lead vocalist of the rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. After leaving Oasis, he formed [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]]. Gallagher is one of the most successful songwriters in British music history, as the writer of eight UK number-one singles and co-writer of a further number one, as well as the sole or primary writer of twelve UK number-one studio albums. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential songwriters in the history of [[British rock music]], cited by numerous major subsequent artists as an influence.\n\nGallagher began playing the guitar at the age of twelve, and became a roadie and technician for [[Inspiral Carpets]] when he was 21. He learnt that his younger brother [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] had joined a band called the Rain, which Liam subsequently renamed to Oasis; Liam invited him to join the group as manager. After rejecting the offer, Gallagher agreed to join the band, on the condition that he would take creative control of the group and become its sole songwriter and lead guitarist.\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Definitely Maybe]]'' (1994), was a widespread critical and commercial success. Their second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. [[Britpop]] eventually declined in popularity, and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, ''[[Don't Believe the Truth]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following an altercation with his brother, Gallagher announced his departure from Oasis. He went on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, with whom he has released four studio albums.\n\nOasis's time was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which Gallagher was involved in several disputes with Liam. Their conflicts and wild lifestyles regularly made tabloid headlines. The band had a rivalry with fellow Britpop band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. Gallagher himself was often regarded as a pioneer and spearhead of the Britpop movement. Many have praised his songwriting, with [[Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]] calling him \"the finest songwriter of his generation\". Conversely, he was voted the most overrated guitarist of the last millennium in a 1999 poll, which he named as the accolade he most enjoyed receiving, and the ninth-most-overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey.",
