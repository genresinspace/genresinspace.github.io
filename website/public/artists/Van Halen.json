By 1982, the band had released four more albums: ''[[Van Halen II]]'' (1979), ''[[Women and Children First]]'' (1980), ''[[Fair Warning (Van Halen album)|Fair Warning]]'' (1981), and ''[[Diver Down]]'' (1982), all of which have been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was among the most commercially successful rock acts.

Former [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]] frontman [[Gary Cherone]] replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album ''[[Van Halen III]]'' with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999.

Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. Roth returned in 2006, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, [[Wolfgang Van Halen]]. In 2012, the band released their final studio album, ''[[A Different Kind of Truth]]'', which was critically and commercially successful. It was also the band's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang. Eddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020. A month after his father's death, Wolfgang confirmed that Van Halen had disbanded.\n\n{{As of|March 2019}}, Van Halen is 20th on the RIAA's list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the U.S. and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling groups of all time]]. {{As of|2007}}, Van Halen is one of only five rock bands with two studio albums to sell more than 10 million copies in the United States and is tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band.
