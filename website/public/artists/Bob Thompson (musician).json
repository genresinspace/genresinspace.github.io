  "description": "'''Robert Lamar Thompson''' (August 24, 1924 – May 21, 2013) was a composer, [[arranger]], and orchestra leader from the 1950s through the 1980s. Active in Los Angeles, Thompson was a recording artist for [[RCA Victor]] and [[Dot Records]], scored film and television soundtracks, and wrote musical accompaniments for commercials. He composed, arranged, and conducted the orchestra for such wide-ranging artists as [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Mae West]], [[Julie London]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[The Andrews Sisters]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Duane Eddy]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Jerry Lewis]], and [[Phil Ochs]].\n\nIn an interview, [[Van Dyke Parks]], who hired Thompson to arrange \"Canon in D\" for his 1976 album ''[[Clang of the Yankee Reaper]]'', said: \"In terms of raw invention, I place Bob in the pantheon of [[Spike Jones]], [[Les Paul]], and [[Juan García Esquivel]]. Like Beethoven, they were 'populists' in good heart. They meant to appeal to the masses, and did so, by enlightening them.\"\n\nThompson is considered a prime exponent of what has belatedly been termed \"[[Space Age Pop]],\" or \"Space Age Bachelor Pad Music.\" This style of breezy, experimental orchestral music became popular in the 1950s and 1960s following the introduction of the long-playing [[microgroove record]] and the advent of [[high-fidelity]] and stereo home audio systems, which allowed enhanced sonic reproduction. In Thompson's 2013 ''L.A. Times'' obit, Koop Kooper, creator of the “Cocktail Nation” podcast and radio show, called Thompson \"a seminal figure, a major inventor of this kind of music.\"",
