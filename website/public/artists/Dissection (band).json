  "name": "Dissection",
  "description": "'''Dissection''' was a Swedish [[extreme metal]] band from [[Strömstad]], formed in 1989 by guitarist, vocalist, and main songwriter [[Jon Nödtveidt]] and bassist Peter Palmdahl. Despite several lineup changes, Dissection released ''[[The Somberlain]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Storm of the Light's Bane]]'' in 1995 before splitting up in 1997 due to Nödtveidt's imprisonment for complicity in the [[Keillers Park murder|murder of Josef Meddour]].\n\nAfter his release, Nödtveidt reformed the band in 2004 with new members whom he felt could \"stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's [[Satanism|Satanic]] concept.\" They released their third and final full-length album, ''[[Reinkaos]]'', in April 2006 before disbanding that June. Nödtveidt said he had \"reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about.\" Two months later, Nödtveidt committed suicide with a gun inside a circle of lit candles in his apartment in [[Hässelby]].\n\nDissection released several live albums and EPs before its final dissolution and played a central role in the development of Sweden's [[black metal]] and [[Swedish death metal|death metal]] scenes, particularly through the influence of the first two albums; it has sometimes been described as part of the [[Melodic death metal|Gothenburg scene]].",
