They made their name with a distinctive style of power pop, fusing [[sampling (music)|samples]], sequenced [[bass guitar|bass]]es and [[drum machine]]s with [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] [[guitar]]s and off-beat wordplay-loaded lyrics.  They reached the height of their fame in 1992–1993. Over the following years the band took on new members, reaching a six-piece. They initially split up in 1998 after releasing seven albums. \n\nIn 2007, Carter USM reformed and continued to perform a small number of shows annually, without releasing any new material, until amicably splitting again at the end of 2014.",
