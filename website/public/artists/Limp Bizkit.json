  "description": "''' Limp Bizkit''' is an American [[rap metal]] band from [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. Its lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Fred Durst]], drummer [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]], guitarist [[Wes Borland]], turntablist [[DJ Lethal]] and bassist [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]]. The band's musical style is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks, and uniforms, also plays a large role in Limp Bizkit's live shows. The band has been nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]], sold 40 million records worldwide, and won several other awards.\n\nFormed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville [[underground music]] scene in the late 1990s, and signed with [[Flip Records (1994)|Flip Records]] (with distribution from [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]), who released the band's debut album, ''[[Three Dollar Bill, Y'all]]'' (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000). However, this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001; however, Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]]. Following the release of their fourth album ''[[Results May Vary]]'' (2003), Borland rejoined the band and recorded the EP ''[[The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)]]'' (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer [[Sammy Siegler]] before entering a hiatus. In 2009, the band once again reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]]; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled ''Stampede of the Disco Elephants'', the band released its sixth studio album ''[[Still Sucks]]'' on October 31, 2021.\n\nThe band has released 26 singles. Their most notable singles include \"[[Nookie (Limp Bizkit song)|Nookie]]\", \"[[Re-Arranged]]\", \"[[Break Stuff]]\", \"[[Take a Look Around (song)|Take a Look Around]]\", \"[[Rollin' (Limp Bizkit song)|Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)]]\", \"[[My Generation (Limp Bizkit song)|My Generation]]\", \"[[My Way (Limp Bizkit song)|My Way]]\", \"[[Eat You Alive]]\", and their cover of [[The Who]]'s 1971 single \"[[Behind Blue Eyes#Limp Bizkit version|Behind Blue Eyes]]\"; all of these have charted within the top 20 of the US Alternative Airplay Chart.",
