Its lineup consists of lead vocalist [[Fred Durst]], drummer [[John Otto (drummer)|John Otto]], guitarist [[Wes Borland]], and turntablist [[DJ Lethal]]. The band's musical style is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation.

The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, ''[[Significant Other (album)|Significant Other]]'' (1999) and ''[[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water]]'' (2000). However, this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at [[Woodstock '99]] and the 2001 [[Big Day Out]] festival.\n\nBorland left the group in 2001; however, Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist [[Mike Smith (guitarist)|Mike Smith]].

In 2009, the band once again reunited with Borland playing guitar and began touring, culminating with the recording of the album ''[[Gold Cobra]]'' (2011), after which it left Interscope and later signed with [[Cash Money Records]]; DJ Lethal quit the band soon afterward, returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled ''Stampede of the Disco Elephants'', the band released its sixth studio album ''[[Still Sucks]]'' on October 31, 2021. Founding bassist [[Sam Rivers (bassist)|Sam Rivers]], who was also responsible for recruiting Otto into the band, died in October 2025.\n\nThe band has released 26 singles.
