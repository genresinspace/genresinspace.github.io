In late 2013, they announced they would take a pause in their career as a duo, after their Líderes Tour. In a 2014 interview with ''[[People en Español]]'', Yandel confirmed that the group would not be disbanding. In February 2018, following a five-year hiatus, the duo announced they would be reuniting, and were set to embark on a world tour, as well as release new music. They sold over 15 million records.",
