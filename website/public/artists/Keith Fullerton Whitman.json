  "description": "'''Keith Fullerton Whitman''' (born May 29, 1973) is an American [[electronic music]]ian who has recorded albums influenced by many genres, including [[ambient music]], [[drill and bass]], and [[krautrock]]. He records and performs using many aliases, of which the best-known is '''Hrvatski''' (the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] word for ''Croatian''). His works under the Hrvatski moniker mainly fell under the 'drill and bass' subgenre of [[intelligent dance music|IDM]], and were his main musical outlet in the mid-to-late 1990s. Other solo aliases include ''ASCIII'' and ''Anonymous''. Keith was in many bands in the 1990s, including ''El-Ron'', ''The Liver Sadness'', ''Sheket/Trabant'', ''The Finger Lakes'' and ''Gai/Jin''.\n\nFullerton Whitman started recording using his own name in 2001, and most of his work recorded today is under that name. His brother, former MIT scientist Brian Alexander Whitman and co-founder of [[The Echo Nest]], is also an electronic musician and sound artist performing under name ''Blitter''.",
