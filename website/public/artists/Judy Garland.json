She is known for her artistic range and strong [[contralto]] voice, working in a variety of genres including [[Musical film|musicals]], [[Comedy film|comedies]], and [[Drama (film and television)|dramas]]. Her career and personal life, marked by both public fascination and private struggle, made her a [[List of Judy Garland biographies|cultural icon]].\n\nGarland began her career at the age of two, performing with her two older sisters as a [[vaudeville]] act called [[The Gumm Sisters]]. In 1935, aged 13, she signed a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) and was initially cast in supporting roles in ensemble musicals such as ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (1937) and ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]'' (1937). She achieved international recognition for her portrayal of [[Dorothy Gale]] in the musical film ''[[The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). She followed this with leading roles in MGM musicals including ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), ''[[Easter Parade (film)|Easter Parade]]'' (1948), and ''[[Summer Stock]]'' (1950). She expanded her range with dramatic performances in ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954) and ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961), both of which earned her [[Academy Award]] nominations. \n\nGarland's music career was kickstarted with her [[List of signature songs|signature song]] \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the ''Wizard of Oz''. She recorded 11 [[Judy Garland discography#Studio albums|studio albums]] between 1939 and 1962. Her albums [[Meet Me in St. Louis (album)|''Meet Me in St. Louis'']] (1944) and ''[[Miss Show Business]]'' (1955) peaked in the top ten of the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], while ''[[Judy (Judy Garland album)|Judy]]'' (1956), ''[[Alone (Judy Garland album)|Alone]]'' (1957), and ''[[The Garland Touch]]'' (1962) reached the top 40. Her live album, ''[[Judy at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1961), made Garland the first woman to win the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. Also in 1961 she became the first female recipient and youngest honoree of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]].\n\nGarland married five times and had three children, including actresses and singers [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Lorna Luft]].
