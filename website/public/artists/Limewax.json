  "description": "'''Maxim Anokhin''' (born 1988), known by his stage name '''Limewax''' is a Ukrainian [[drum and bass]] music producer and [[DJ]] from [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], [[Ukraine]]. His style is described as inspired by harsher sounds of [[hardstep]] and [[darkstep]]; however, he is most recognizable as a [[Skullstep]] artist. He has collaborated with artists such as [[The Panacea]], [[Current Value]], Donny, Proket, and [[Freak Recordings|Dylan]].\n\nAnokhin began composing music shortly after moving to [[Tilburg]], [[Netherlands]] in 1999. At the age of seventeen, he released his first [[Extended play|EP]], ''Changing Crisis'', on high-profile [[record label|label]] Tech Itch Recordings in 2005. As a result, Anokhin became notable for emerging into the electronic music industry at a young age, and quickly gained popularity leading to performances at Therapy Sessions events worldwide.\n\nIn 2024, DJ Mag referred to Anokhin as \"an icon in the hard drum & bass scene\" in their coverage of his work.",
