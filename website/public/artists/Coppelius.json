The band's name is taken from [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]'s short story \"[[Der Sandmann]]\". Their logo consists of a [[top hat]] with the word \"Coppelius\" underneath. \nThe band is made up of Max Coppella ([[clarinet]] and vocals), Comte Caspar ([[clarinet]], vocals, [[harpsichord]]), Graf Lindorf ([[cello]], vocals), Sissy Voss ([[double bass]]), Herr Linus von Doppelschlag ([[drums]], joined 2019), and Bastille (Butler, vocals). Former band members include Nobusama ([[drums]], left 2018). Additionally, they are often accompanied by Prof. Mosch Terpin (technician and harpsichord).\nOn stage the members of the band wear formal, old-fashioned clothes, inspired mainly by the [[Victorian era]]. This era is also an inspiration for a lot of the themes in Copellius' music. For this reason, they are often referred to as a [[Steampunk]] band.",
