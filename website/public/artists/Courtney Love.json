  "description": "'''Courtney Michelle Love''' ([[née]] '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actress whose career has spanned four decades. She has had a significant impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers, with ''[[NME]]'' naming her one of the most influential singers in [[alternative culture]] between 1990 and 2020.\n\nLove had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon, where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. Following a brief stay in a [[juvenile hall]], she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and pursuing an acting career. She appeared in supporting roles in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). In 1989, Love formed the alternative rock band [[Hole (band)|Hole]] with guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]]. She was its lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist. She was becoming a rising figure in the [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s. However, her highly publicized relationship with, and 1992 marriage to, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] followed by his death in 1994 temporarily overshadowed her music career.\n\nLove and Hole soon rose to prominence due to her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics. The group received critical acclaim from underground rock press for their 1991 debut album ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'', produced by [[Kim Gordon]], while their second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (Courtney Love album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The subsequent several years were marred with publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug relapse, which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''. She has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love|Dirty Blonde]]'' (2006).",
