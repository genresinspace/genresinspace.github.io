  "description": "'''Katatonia''' is a Swedish [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Stockholm]] in 1991 by [[Jonas Renkse]] and [[Anders Nyström]]. The band started as a studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for their love of [[death metal]]. Increasing popularity led them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band's founders, the lineup was a constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]] of [[Opeth]] for a period. After two [[death/doom]] albums, ''[[Dance of December Souls]]'' (1993) and ''[[Brave Murder Day]]'' (1996), problems with Renkse's [[vocal cords]] coupled with new musical influences caused the band to stray away from the [[screamed vocals]] of death metal to a more traditional melodic form of [[progressive rock]].\n\nKatatonia released ''[[Discouraged Ones]]'' (1998) and ''[[Tonight's Decision]]'' (1999), before settling into a more stable [[quintet]] lineup for the remainder of the 2000s. The band proceeded to release four more albums with said lineup: ''[[Last Fair Deal Gone Down (album)|Last Fair Deal Gone Down]]'' (2001), ''[[Viva Emptiness]]'' (2003), ''[[The Great Cold Distance]]'' (2006) and ''[[Night Is the New Day]]'' (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their traditional metal sound while adding more progressive rock sounds and influences over time. While the background lineup changes continued into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted.\nThe band continued on to release their ninth and tenth studio albums, respectively, ''[[Dead End Kings]]'' (2012) and ''[[The Fall of Hearts]]'' (2016).\n\nAfter touring in support of the ''[[The Fall of Hearts]]'' album throughout 2017, the band went into a semi-hiatus at the beginning of 2018. Katatonia returned in February 2019 with their eleventh studio album, ''[[City Burials]]'' (2020), proceeded by their twelfth studio album ''[[Sky Void of Stars]]'' (2023), and thirteenth studio album ''Nightmares as Extensions of the Waking State'' (2025).",
