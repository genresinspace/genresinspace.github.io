  "description": "{{nihongo|'''Midori'''|ミドリ}} was a Japanese [[punk jazz]] band. They were founded in [[Osaka]] in 2003 by former members of the noise and punk rock band {{nihongo|Usagi|うさぎ}}, [[Mariko Gotō]] and Yoshitaka Kozeni. Their final lineup featured Gotō on vocals and guitar, Kozeni on drums, Keigo Iwami on bass, and Hajime on keyboard.\n\nGotō often wore school uniforms while performing, and would climb speakers and crowd surf. The band initially formed to play covers of [[kayōkyoku]], but decided they weren't talented enough, and began to write their own songs. As they developed, their influences included [[Italian progressive rock|Italian prog]], [[Kodō (taiko group)|Kodō]], the [[J-rock]] band [[Judy & Mary]], and [[Janis Joplin]].\n\nTheir disbandment was publicly announced by Gotō on December 25, 2010, with their last show, titled \"Sayonara, Gotō-san\", played on December 28.\n\nMidori released three albums, three extended plays, and two demos.",
