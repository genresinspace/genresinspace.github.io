  "description": "'''The Chariot''' was an American [[hardcore punk]] band from [[Douglasville, Georgia]], that existed from 2003 to 2013. The last lineup consisted of drummer David Kennedy, vocalist and bandleader [[Josh Scogin]], and guitarists Brandon Henderson and Stephen Harrison. The band experienced frequent lineup changes since its inception, with Scogin being the only original member. The band played an abrasive style of metalcore that did not adhere to typical stylings popular among their contemporaries such as melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonic vocals. They built a reputation around their powerful live performances, with Scogin's lyrics covering topics like [[materialism]], personal struggle, current events, politics, and [[Christianity|Christian]] themes.\n\nThe band was formed by Scogin shortly after he left his position of vocalist in [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]]. In 2004, a record deal was signed with [[Solid State Records]] and a debut album was released, titled ''[[Everything Is Alive, Everything Is Breathing, Nothing Is Dead, and Nothing Is Bleeding]]''. The band toured constantly after that. The Chariot released the [[Unsung (EP)|Unsung EP]] in 2005, which was then followed by three successful studio albums: ''[[The Fiancée (album)|The Fiancée]]'' in 2007, ''[[Wars and Rumors of Wars]]'' in 2009, and ''[[Long Live (The Chariot album)|Long Live]]'' in 2010. The band entered the studio in May 2012 to record their fifth full-length album titled ''[[One Wing]]'' which was released August 28, 2012. The Chariot disbanded following a farewell tour in late 2013.",
