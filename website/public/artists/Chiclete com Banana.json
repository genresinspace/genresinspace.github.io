  "description": "'''Chiclete com Banana''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"[[chewing gum]] with [[banana]]\") is an [[Axé music]] band, currently consisting of [[Bell Marques]], [[Wadinho Marques]], Rey, [[Waltinho Cruz]], Deny and Lelo. \nThe group is named after the very well known and influential song \"[[Chiclete com banana (song)|Chiclete com Banana]]\", written by Gordurinha (Waldeck Artur Macedo; 1922–1969) and Almira Castilho, which was first recorded in 1959 by Brazilian popstar [[Jackson do Pandeiro]] and by dozens of performers, including [[Gilberto Gil]]. The group has sold more than 8 million album copies.\n\nChiclete com Banana released its first album, called ''Estação Das Cores'' (1983) and ''Traz os montes'', in 1983, and is regarded as one of the most successful bands of the Axé music genre in [[Brazil]]. Chiclete rose to fame in [[Bahia]] in the 1980s like other axé bands and artists (among them the famous [[Ivete Sangalo]]). Today, Chiclete is one of the most popular and expensive micaretas during [[Bahian Carnival|Carnaval in Bahia]], although they perform throughout Brazil all year. Their performance can cost R$400.000 for 2.5 hours of show (about $100,000 USD) or more during [[Brazilian Carnival|Carnaval]]  in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. They usually have anywhere from 200,000 to 500,000 people walking along their sound truck (or ''[[Trio Elétrico]]''). This is divided in about 5,000 – 10,000 people inside the \"ropes\" who bought the abadás, special shirts that everyone wears. The band has its own [[Trio Elétrico]] named Tyrannosaurus Rex 2000-2009 and Rex Skydome 2010-2013.",
