  "description": "'''Micheal Ray Stevenson''' (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as '''Tyga''' ({{IPAc-en|'|t|aɪ|g|ə}}; a [[backronym]] for '''Thank You God Always'''), is an American rapper and singer. After several independent releases, he signed a recording contract with [[Lil Wayne]]'s [[Young Money Entertainment]], an imprint of [[Cash Money Records]] and [[Republic Records]] in 2008. His second album and major label debut, ''[[Careless World: Rise of the Last King]]'' (2012), peaked at number four on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and was met with critical praise. It spawned the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top ten single \"[[Rack City]]\", as well as the top 40 single  \"[[Faded (Tyga song)|Faded]]\" (featuring [[Lil Wayne]]). His third album, ''[[Hotel California (Tyga album)|Hotel California]]'' (2013), was met with trailing critical and commercial response, along with his collaborative album with singer [[Chris Brown]], ''[[Fan of a Fan: The Album]]'' (2015).\n\nDue to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album, ''[[The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty]]'' (2015), was released independently. Executive-produced by his then-common law relative [[Kanye West]], it became his lowest-selling album to that point with estimated sales of 5,000 [[Billboard 200#Incorporation of streaming data and track sales|album equivalent units]] in its first week. His fifth and sixth albums, ''[[BitchImTheShit2]]'' (2017) and ''[[Kyoto (Tyga album)|Kyoto]]'' (2018), were both met with continued stagnation. His May 2018 single, \"[[Taste (Tyga song)|Taste]]\" (featuring [[Offset (rapper)|Offset]]), marked a brief period of commercial resurgence; it became his first [[top 40]] single since 2015's \"[[Ayo (song)|Ayo]]\" (with Chris Brown)—peaking at number eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100—and received [[RIAA certification|diamond]] certification by the RIAA. It served as lead single and preceded the release of his seventh album, ''[[Legendary (Tyga album)|Legendary]]'' (2019).",
