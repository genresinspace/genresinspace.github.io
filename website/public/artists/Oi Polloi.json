  "description": "'''Oi Polloi''' are a [[punk rock]] band from [[Scotland]] that formed around 1981. Starting as an [[Oi!]] band, they are now generally more associated with the [[anarcho-punk]] [[genre]]. The band has become notable for their contributions to the [[Scottish Gaelic punk]] subgenre. The name comes from the Greek expression \"οἱ πολλοί\", Anglicized ''[[hoi polloi]]'', meaning \"the masses\" or \"the common people\".\n\nThe band has gone through about 50 members since their formation, and their only permanent member has been vocalist Deek Allen, who has also been involved in Gaelic-language television. The band has included [[punk (subculture)|punks]] and [[skinhead]]s. The members have been supporters of [[Anti-Fascist Action]] and [[Earth First!]], and they use the motto \"No Compromise in Defence of Our Earth,\" which is an adaptation of Earth First!'s motto. They support [[direct action]] in defence of the environment, [[hunt sabotage]], as well as resistance against racism, [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], fascism and [[imperialism]]. They are also supporters of [[Linux]] and criticized [[Microsoft]] in their song, L.I.N.U.X.",
