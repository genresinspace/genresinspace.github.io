  "description": "'''John Aloysius Fahey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|eɪ|h|i}} {{respell|FAY|hee}}; February 28, 1939 – February 22, 2001) was an American [[fingerstyle guitar]]ist and composer who played the [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] as a solo instrument. His style has been enormously influential and has been described as the foundation of the genre of [[American primitive guitar]], a term borrowed from painting and referring mainly to the self-taught nature of the music and its minimalist style. Fahey borrowed from the [[folk music|folk]] and [[blues]] traditions in [[American roots music]], having compiled many forgotten early recordings in these genres. He would later incorporate [[20th-century classical music|20th-century classical]], Portuguese, Brazilian, and Indian influences into his work.\n\nFahey spent many of his later years in poverty and poor health, but enjoyed a minor career resurgence in the late 1990s, with a turn towards the [[avant-garde]]. He also created a series of abstract paintings in his final years. Fahey died in 2001 from complications from heart surgery. In 2003, he was ranked 35th on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" list. In 2023, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Fahey as 40th greatest guitarist of all time.",
