  "name": "The Damned",
  "description": "'''The Damned''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1976 by lead vocalist [[David Vanian|Dave Vanian]], guitarist [[Brian James (guitarist)|Brian James]], bassist (and later guitarist) [[Captain Sensible]] and drummer [[Rat Scabies]]. They were the first punk band from the United Kingdom to release a single, \"[[New Rose]]\" (1976), release a studio album, ''[[Damned Damned Damned]]'' (1977) and tour the United States. Nine of the band's singles charted on the [[UK Singles Chart]] [[Top 40]].\n\nThe band briefly dissolved after ''[[Music for Pleasure (The Damned album)|Music for Pleasure]]'' (1977), the follow-up to their debut studio album, was critically dismissed. They quickly reformed without Brian James and released ''[[Machine Gun Etiquette]]'' (1979). In the 1980s, they released four studio albums: ''[[The Black Album (The Damned album)|The Black Album]]'' (1980), ''[[Strawberries (album)|Strawberries]]'' (1982), ''[[Phantasmagoria (The Damned album)|Phantasmagoria]]'' (1985) and ''[[Anything (The Damned album)|Anything]]'' (1986), which saw the band moving toward a [[gothic rock]] style. The latter two albums did not feature Sensible, who had left the band in 1984. In 1988, James and Sensible rejoined to play a series of reunion gigs, one of which was released the next year as the live album ''[[Final Damnation]]'' (1989). Their fast-driven punk rock has been cited for influencing and shaping the emergence of [[hardcore punk]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe Damned again reformed for a tour in 1991. In 1995, they released a new studio album, ''[[Not of This Earth (The Damned album)|Not of This Earth]]'', which was Scabies's last with the band. This was followed by ''[[Grave Disorder]]'' (2001), ''[[So, Who's Paranoid?]]'' (2008) and ''[[Evil Spirits (The Damned album)|Evil Spirits]]'' (2018), their first studio album in the [[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] top-10 list, landing at No. 7. Their most recent album, ''[[Darkadelic]]'', was released in 2023 and also made it into the [[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] top-10 list, landing at No. 9. Despite experiencing numerous lineup changes, the formation of Vanian, Sensible, keyboardist [[Monty Oxymoron]], drummer Pinch and bassist [[Stu West]] had been together from 2004 until 2017, when West left the band and former bassist [[Paul Gray (English musician)|Paul Gray]] rejoined. In 2019, drummer Pinch left the band, and in February 2022 he was replaced by Will Taylor, who left in November 2023, when Scabies rejoined.\n\nAs one of the first [[gothic rock]] bands, the Damned, featuring lead singer Vanian's [[baritone]] singing, dark lyrics and [[vampire]]-themed costume, were a major influence on the [[goth subculture]].",
