ABC achieved ten UK and five US [[top 40]] hit singles from 1981 to 1990. Their 1982 debut studio album, ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'', was a UK number one. Their early-1980s success in the US saw them associated with the [[Second British Invasion]]. ABC continued to release music throughout the 1980s, with notable albums such as ''Beauty Stab'' (1983) and ''How to Be a...Zillionaire!'' (1985), the latter producing hits in both the UK and the United States. \n\nAlthough their commercial success declined after the 1980s, ABC have remained active through live performances, reissues, and occasional new material. In 2016, Fry released ''The Lexicon of Love II'', a sequel to their debut album, which was well received by both critics and fans.",
