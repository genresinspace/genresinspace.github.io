  "description": "'''ABC''' are an English [[Pop music|pop]] band which formed in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]] in 1980, evolving from the earlier [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Vice Versa (band)|Vice Versa]]. Associated with the [[new pop]] movement of the early 1980s, ABC blended [[synth-pop]] with [[disco]] and [[Rock music|rock]] influences. The band achieved mainstream success with their debut studio album, ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'' (1982), which featured the hit singles \"[[Poison Arrow]]\", \"[[All of My Heart]]\" and \"[[The Look of Love (ABC song)|The Look of Love]]\" and reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\nFronted by [[Stockport]]-raised [[Martin Fry]], the band's only constant member, the band's classic formation featured Fry as the lead vocalist, [[Mark White (British musician)|Mark White]] on guitar and keyboards, [[Stephen Singleton]] on saxophone, and David Palmer on drums. ABC achieved ten UK and five US [[top 40]] hit singles from 1981 to 1990. Their debut studio album, ''[[The Lexicon of Love]]'' (1982), was a UK number one. The band's early-1980s success in the US made them part of the [[Second British Invasion]]. ABC continued to release music throughout the 1980s, with notable studio albums such as ''[[Beauty Stab]]'' (1983) and ''[[How to Be a ... Zillionaire!]]'' (1985), the latter producing hits in both the UK and the US.\n\nAlthough their commercial success declined after the 1980s, ABC have remained active through live performances, reissues, and occasional new material. In 2016, Fry released ''[[The Lexicon of Love II]]'', a sequel to their debut studio album, which was well received by both critics and fans.",
