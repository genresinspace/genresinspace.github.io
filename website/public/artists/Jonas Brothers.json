  "description": "The '''Jonas Brothers''' ({{IPAc-en|'|dʒ|oʊ|n|ə|s}}) are an American [[pop rock]] band formed in 2005 comprising brothers [[Kevin Jonas]], [[Joe Jonas]], and [[Nick Jonas]]. Raised in [[Wyckoff, New Jersey]], the Jonas Brothers moved to [[Little Falls, New Jersey]], in 2005, where they wrote their first record that made its release on [[Hollywood Records]], a [[Disney Music Group|Disney-owned]] [[record label]], after which they gained popularity from their appearances on [[Disney Channel]]. They starred in the 2008 [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] ''[[Camp Rock]]'' and its 2010 sequel, ''[[Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam]]''. They also starred in their own Disney Channel series ''[[Jonas (TV series)|Jonas]]'', which was rebranded as ''Jonas L.A.'' for its second season. The band has released six albums: ''[[It's About Time (Jonas Brothers album)|It's About Time]]'' (2006), ''[[Jonas Brothers (album)|Jonas Brothers]]'' (2007), ''[[A Little Bit Longer]]'' (2008), ''[[Lines, Vines and Trying Times]]'' (2009), ''[[Happiness Begins]]'' (2019), and ''[[The Album (Jonas Brothers album)|The Album]]'' (2023).\n\nIn 2008, the group was nominated for the Best New Artist award at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] and won the award for Breakthrough Artist at the [[American Music Awards]]. Before the release of ''Lines, Vines and Trying Times'', they had sold over eight million albums worldwide. After a hiatus between 2010 and 2011 to pursue solo projects, the group reunited in 2012 to record a new album, which was cancelled following their break-up on October 29, 2013. As of that year, they had sold over 17&nbsp;million albums worldwide.\n\nSix years following their split, the group reunited with the release of \"[[Sucker (song)|Sucker]]\" on March 1, 2019. The song became the 34th song in history to debut at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and became the Jonas Brothers' first number one single on the chart. Their fifth studio album, ''Happiness Begins,'' was released on June 7, 2019, topping the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nThe brothers released their sixth studio album, ''[[The Album (Jonas Brothers album)|The Album]],'' on May 12, 2023, preceded by two singles, \"[[Waffle House (song)|Waffle House]]\" and \"[[Wings (Jonas Brothers song)|Wings]]\". The 12-track record was produced by [[Jon Bellion]].",
