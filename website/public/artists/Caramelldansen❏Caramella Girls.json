  "description": "'''Caramella Girls''' is a [[virtual band|virtual group]] created by Remixed Records in 2008 to promote the \"Caramelldansen\" song. They first showed up in the Japanese release \"U-u-uma uma\" single on 21 May 2008 as two anime character counterparts for the two female vocalists [[Dinah Nah|Malin Sundström]] and Katia Löfgren, removing the rest of the band members. They were then redesigned to be a girl group of three virtual girl characters – Mindy, Nadine, and Vera. At some live events, they would appear in masks and costumes. Remixed Records has further rebranded all related releases on music platforms from Caramell to \"Caramella Girls\".\n\nOn 18 March 2011, Caramella Girls released the song \"Boogie Bam Dance\", available in English, Spanish, and German. In October 2012, the band released the ''Caramelldancing Remixes EP'', which features remixes of the English version of the Caramelldansen song by Crazy 1, No Trixx, and DJ Triplestar.\n\nCaramella Girls has since released other songs and videos. Some of these were written by Kim Andre Arnesen and Kristian Lagerström; and some are covers of other [[bubblegum pop]] tunes. In 2020, they released a digital compilation album (without \"Caramelldansen\") called ''Sweet Decade''.",
