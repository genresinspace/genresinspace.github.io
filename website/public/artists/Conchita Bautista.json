  "description": "'''María Concepción Bautista Fernández''' (born 27 October 1936), better known as '''Conchita Bautista''' ({{IPA|es|konˈtʃita βawˈtista}}), is a Spanish singer and actress. She {{esccnty|Spain|t=represented Spain}} in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]] and {{escyr|1965}}.\n\nBautista moved from her native [[Andalusia]] to [[Madrid]] in her teens and quickly established herself as an actress, appearing in a number of films in the 1950s. At the same time she was earning a reputation as an interpreter of Andalusian music and gained a recording contract with the Columbia label.\n\nOn 13–14 February 1961, Bautista took part in the {{esccnty|Spain|y=1961|t=Spanish selection}} for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961]] with the song \"[[Estando contigo]]\", which was chosen as the Spanish debut entry in the contest. On 18 March, she performed \"Estando contigo\" as the opening song in [[Cannes]], France, and at the end of voting she placed ninth of the 16 entries.\n\nOn 7 February 1965, Bautista came through a very convoluted {{esccnty|Spain|y=1965|t=selection process}} to win the Spanish ticket for a second time for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1965]] with \"[[Qué bueno, qué bueno]]\". On 20 March, in [[Naples]], \"Qué bueno, qué bueno\" was one of four songs (along with those from {{esccnty|Germany|y=1965}}, {{esccnty|Belgium|y=1965}}, and {{esccnty|Finland|y=1965}}) which failed to score, representing Spain's second ''[[nul points]]'' following [[Víctor Balaguer (singer)|Víctor Balaguer]] in {{esccnty|Spain|y=1962|t=1962}}.\n\nIn later years, Bautista forged a successful recording and touring career in Latin America, Italy, Greece, and Turkey as well as in Spain.",
