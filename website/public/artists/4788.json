  "description": "'''The O'Jays''' are an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group from [[Canton, Ohio]], formed in summer 1958 and originally consisting of [[Eddie Levert]], Walter Lee Williams, William Powell, Bobby Massey, and Bill Isles. The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with the minor hit \"Lonely Drifter\" in 1963, but reached their greatest level of success once the producers [[Gamble & Huff]] signed them to their [[Philadelphia International]] label in 1972. With Gamble & Huff, the O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of [[Philadelphia soul]] with [[Back Stabbers (song)|''Back Stabbers'']] (1972), and topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the following year with \"[[Love Train]]\". Several other US R&B hits followed, and the O'Jays were inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2004, [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2005, and the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame]] in 2013.",
