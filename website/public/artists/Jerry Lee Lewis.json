  "description": "'''Jerry Lee Lewis''' (September 29, 1935{{snd}}October 28, 2022) was an American pianist, singer, and songwriter. Nicknamed \"'''The Killer'''\", he was described as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He later became known for his chart topping country music recordings from the 1960s and 1970s. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\", and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\".\n\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Lewis Williams|Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old cousin. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]], and had hits with songs such as \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]]. His number-one country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and release new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\n\nLewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]]. He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022. In 1989, his life was chronicled in the movie ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire]]'', starring [[Dennis Quaid]]. In 2003, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed his box set ''[[All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology]]'' at number 242 on their list of \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\". In 2004, they ranked him No. 24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Lewis was the last surviving member of [[Sun Records]]' [[Million Dollar Quartet]] and the album ''[[Class of '55: Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming|Class of '55]]'', which also included [[Johnny Cash]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nMusic critic [[Robert Christgau]] said of Lewis: \"His drive, his timing, his offhand vocal power, his unmistakable [[boogie]]-plus piano, and his absolute confidence in the face of [[The Void (philosophy)|the void]] make Jerry Lee the quintessential rock and roller.\"",
