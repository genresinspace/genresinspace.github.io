Known for her diaristic lyrics and genre explorations, she is regarded as a prominent figure in influencing [[contemporary R&B]] music and popularizing [[alternative R&B]].\n\nSZA signed with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] in 2013 after gaining attention online with two self-released [[extended play]]s (EP). Under the label, she released the [[lo-fi]] and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] EP ''[[Z (EP)|Z]]'' (2014), then her R&B debut album [[Ctrl (SZA album)|''Ctrl'']] (2017). The latter was a critical success; it placed in several year-end lists and earned SZA five [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2018. After ''Ctrl'', she embarked on a four-year series of collaborations, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]]–nominated \"[[All the Stars]]\" (2018) with [[Kendrick Lamar]], which reached the top 10 in the US and UK. Her feature on [[Doja Cat]]'s \"[[Kiss Me More]]\" (2021) won SZA her first Grammy Award.\n\nWith the acclaimed and multi-genre ''[[SOS (SZA album)|SOS]]'' (2022), SZA set several new chart records. The album became the first by a woman to spend 100 weeks in the ''Billboard'' 200's top 10 and broke the record for the longest-running US top-10 by a Black musician. Its fifth single, \"[[Kill Bill (song)|Kill Bill]]\", was the third best-selling song of 2023 and peaked atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. From 2024 to 2025, SZA achieved a string of top-10s with \"[[Saturn (SZA song)|Saturn]]\" and \"[[30 for 30 (song)|30 for 30]]\", both from the deluxe reissue of ''SOS'' entitled ''[[Lana (album)|Lana]]'' (2024), and her longest-running US number-one \"[[Luther (song)|Luther]]\". Her 2025 [[Grand National Tour]] with Lamar is the highest-grossing co-headlining tour in history.\n\n[[List of awards and nominations received by SZA|SZA has earned numerous accolades]] throughout her career, including five [[Grammy Awards]], a [[Brit Award]], three [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Guild of Music Supervisors Award]], and two [[Billboard Women in Music|''Billboard'' Women in Music]] awards, including [[Billboard Women in Music#Woman of the Year Award|Woman of the Year]].
