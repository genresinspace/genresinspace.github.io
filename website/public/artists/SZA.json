  "description": "'''Solána Imani Rowe''' (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as '''SZA''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|z|ə|audio=LL-Q1860 (eng)-Flame, not lame-SZA.wav}} {{respell|SIZ|ə}}), is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her diaristic lyrics and genre explorations, she is regarded as a prominent figure in influencing [[contemporary R&B]] music and popularizing [[alternative R&B]].\n\nSZA first garnered attention with her self-released [[extended play]]s (EPs) ''[[See.SZA.Run]]'' (2012) and ''[[S (EP)|S]]'' (2013). The projects led her to sign with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] in 2013, through which she released her third EP, ''[[Z (EP)|Z]]'' (2014). Her alternative R&B-imbued debut studio album, [[Ctrl (SZA album)|''Ctrl'']] (2017), was a critical and commercial success. It earned four [[Grammy Award]] nominations in 2018, and became the second longest-charting R&B album by a woman on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The top-ten 2018 single \"[[All the Stars]]\", a collaboration with [[Kendrick Lamar]], earned her [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] nominations for Best Original Song. Her feature on [[Doja Cat]]'s \"[[Kiss Me More]]\" in 2021 won them their first [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Grammy Award]]. \n\nWith the acclaimed and experimental ''[[SOS (SZA album)|SOS]]'' (2022), SZA set several new chart records. The album became the first by a woman to spend 100 weeks in the ''Billboard'' 200's top 10 and broke the record for the longest-running US top-10 by a Black musician. Its fifth single, \"[[Kill Bill (song)|Kill Bill]]\", was SZA's first chart-topper on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. From 2024 to 2025, she achieved a string of top-10s with \"[[Saturn (SZA song)|Saturn]]\" and \"[[30 for 30 (song)|30 for 30]]\", both from the deluxe reissue of ''SOS'' entitled ''[[Lana (album)|Lana]]'' (2024), and her longest-running US number-one \"[[Luther (song)|Luther]]\". Her 2025 [[Grand National Tour]] with Lamar is the highest-grossing co-headlining tour in history.\n\n[[List of awards and nominations received by SZA|SZA has earned numerous accolades]] throughout her career, including five [[Grammy Awards]], a [[Brit Award]], three [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Guild of Music Supervisors Award]], and two [[Billboard Women in Music|''Billboard'' Women in Music]] awards, including [[Billboard Women in Music#Woman of the Year Award|Woman of the Year]].
