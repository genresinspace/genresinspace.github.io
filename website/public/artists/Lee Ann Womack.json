  "description": "'''Lee Ann Womack''' ({{IPAc-en|'|w|oʊ|m|æ|k}}; born August 19, 1966) is an American singer and songwriter. She has charted 23 times on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts; her highest peaking single there is her [[crossover (music)|crossover]] signature song, \"[[I Hope You Dance]]\", a collaboration with country band [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]] which reached number one in 2000. Five of her singles made top 10 on the country music charts of the defunct ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' magazine in Canada.\n\nBorn in [[Jacksonville, Texas]], Womack was signed by [[Decca Records]] Nashville in 1996. When she emerged as a contemporary country artist in 1997, her material drew critical comparisons to [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tammy Wynette]], except for the way Womack's music mixed an old-fashioned style with contemporary elements. That year, she had her first top 10 hits with \"[[The Fool (Lee Ann Womack song)|The Fool]]\" and \"[[You've Got to Talk to Me]]\". After two albums with Decca, she released her first [[MCA Nashville]] album, 2000's ''[[I Hope You Dance (album)|I Hope You Dance]]''; it had an entirely different sound, using pop music elements instead of traditional country. It was not until the release of ''[[There's More Where That Came From]]'' in 2005 that Womack returned to recording traditional country music. She recorded a total of five albums with MCA before releasing a series of independent albums, first on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]] and then on [[ATO Records]]; these albums include a new sound which blended country and [[Americana (music)|Americana]].\n\nFour of Womack's studio albums have received a Gold certification or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], with her most commercially successful album ''I Hope You Dance'' being certified triple-platinum in the United States and platinum in Canada. In addition, she has received five [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], six [[Country Music Association Awards]], and one [[Grammy Award]]. Womack is married to record producer [[Frank Liddell]], and was previously married to songwriter and musician [[Jason Sellers]]; her daughter with the latter, [[Aubrie Sellers]], is also a country music artist.",
