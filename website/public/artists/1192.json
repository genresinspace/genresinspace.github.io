  "description": "'''Gong''' are a rock band associated with the [[Canterbury scene]]. They incorporate elements of [[psychedelic rock]], [[jazz]] and [[space rock]] into their musical style. The group was formed in Paris in 1967 by Australian musician [[Daevid Allen]] and English vocalist [[Gilli Smyth]]. Band members have included [[Didier Malherbe]], [[Pip Pyle]], [[Steve Hillage]], [[Mike Howlett]], [[Tim Blake]], [[Pierre Moerlen]], [[Bill Laswell]] and [[Theo Travis]]. Others who have played on stage with Gong include [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], [[Chris Cutler]], [[Bill Bruford]], [[Brian Davison (drummer)|Brian Davison]], [[Dave Stewart (musician, born 1950)|Dave Stewart]] and [[Tatsuya Yoshida]].\n\nGong's 1970 debut album, ''[[Magick Brother]]'', featured a [[psychedelic rock]] sound. By the following year, the second album, ''[[Camembert Electrique]]'', featured the more [[psychedelic rock]]/[[space rock]] sound with which they would be most associated. Between 1973 and 1974, Gong released their best-known work, the allegorical ''Radio Gnome Invisible'' trilogy, describing the adventures of Zero the Hero, the Good Witch Yoni and the Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong.\n\nIn 1975, Allen and Smyth left the band, which continued without them, releasing a series of [[jazz fusion|jazz rock]] albums under the leadership of drummer [[Pierre Moerlen]]. This incarnation soon became known as [[Pierre Moerlen's Gong]]. Meanwhile, Smyth formed Mother Gong while Allen initiated a series of spin-off groups, including [[Planet Gong]], [[New York Gong]] and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong once again in 1990 until his death in 2015. With Allen's encouragement, the band decided to continue as a quintet comprising guitarist [[Fabio Golfetti]], bassist [[Dave Sturt]], woodwind player Ian East, guitarist and vocalist [[Kavus Torabi]], and drummer Cheb Nettles. They released the album ''[[Rejoice! I'm Dead!]]'' in September 2016, followed by ''[[The Universe Also Collapses]]'' in 2019 and ''[[Unending Ascending]]'' in 2023.",
