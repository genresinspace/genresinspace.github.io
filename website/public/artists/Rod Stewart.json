His music career began in 1962 when he took up [[Street performance|busking]] with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined [[Jimmy Powell (singer)|the Dimensions]] as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined [[Long John Baldry]] and the [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]] before moving to the [[The Jeff Beck Group|Jeff Beck Group]] in 1967. Joining [[Faces (band)|Faces]] in 1969, he also launched a solo career, releasing his debut album, ''[[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down]]'', that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, [[folk music]], [[soul music]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].  His third album, 1971's ''[[Every Picture Tells a Story]]'', was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad \"[[Maggie May]]\". His 1972 follow-up album, ''[[Never a Dull Moment (Rod Stewart album)|Never a Dull Moment]]'', also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, \"[[You Wear It Well]]\", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.\n\nAfter Stewart had a handful more UK top-ten hits, Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads, with \"[[Sailing (Sutherland Brothers song)|Sailing]]\", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, ''[[Atlantic Crossing]]'', becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. ''[[A Night on the Town (Rod Stewart album)|A Night on the Town]]'' (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's \"[[Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)]]\" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. ''[[Foot Loose & Fancy Free]]'' (1977) contained the hit \"[[You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)]]\" as well as the rocker \"Hot Legs\". ''[[Blondes Have More Fun]]'' (1978) and its disco-tinged \"[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]\" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the '70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.\n    \nAfter a disco and [[New wave music|new wave]] period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a [[soft rock]]/[[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single \"[[Rhythm of My Heart]]\" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'', becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with [[Bryan Adams]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] on the power ballad \"[[All for Love (song)|All for Love]]\", which went to number one in many countries.
