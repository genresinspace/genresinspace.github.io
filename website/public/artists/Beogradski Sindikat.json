Beogradski Sindikat is one of the pioneers of the second wave of Serbian hip-hop. The band is known for its socially critical lyrics, especially in relation to political corruption, propaganda and bad governance in Serbia and the Balkans. Other main themes are the idealization of friendly togetherness, a sense of belonging to the city of Belgrade, and patriotism towards Serbian culture and the Serbian Orthodox Church, as well as the rejection of foreign political influence on Serbia. Due to their critical nature, [[Milo Đukanović]], the president of [[Montenegro]], called the group's lyrics an insult to honor.",
