  "description": "The '''Spice Girls''' are an English [[girl group]] formed in 1994, consisting of [[Mel B]] (\"Scary Spice\"), [[Melanie C]] (\"Sporty Spice\"), [[Emma Bunton]] (\"Baby Spice\"), [[Geri Halliwell]] (\"Ginger Spice\"), and [[Victoria Beckham]] (\"Posh Spice\"). They have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them [[List of best-selling girl groups#Best-selling girl groups worldwide|the best-selling girl group of all time]]. With their \"[[girl power]]\" mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the [[teen pop]] resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the [[Cool Britannia]] era, and became [[popular culture]] icons of the decade.\n\nThe Spice Girls were formed by Heart Management, who held auditions to create a girl group to compete with the British [[boy band]]s popular at the time. After leaving Heart, the Spice Girls hired [[Simon Fuller]] as their manager and signed with [[Virgin Records]]. They released their debut single, \"[[Wannabe]]\", in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, ''[[Spice (album)|Spice]]'' (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming [[List of best-selling girl groups#Best-selling girl group albums|the best-selling album by a female group in history]]. It also produced three more number-one singles: \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\", \"[[2 Become 1]]\" and \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Spice Girls song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\"/\"[[Mama (Spice Girls song)|Mama]]\". Their second album, ''[[Spiceworld (album)|Spiceworld]]'' (1997), sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. The Spice Girls achieved three number-one singles from the album with \"[[Spice Up Your Life]]\", \"[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]\" and \"[[Viva Forever]]\". Both albums encapsulated the group's [[dance-pop]] style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members.\n\nIn 1997, the Spice Girls made their [[Girl Power! Live in Istanbul|live concert debut]] and released a feature film, ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'', both to commercial success. In 1998, the group embarked on the [[Spiceworld Tour]], which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group. Halliwell left the Spice Girls mid-tour in May 1998. Following a number-one single with \"[[Goodbye (Spice Girls song)|Goodbye]]\" (1998) and a successful [[Christmas in Spiceworld Tour|1999 concert tour]], the Spice Girls released their [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced third album, ''[[Forever (Spice Girls album)|Forever]]'', in 2000. It featured their ninth number one single with \"[[Holler (Spice Girls song)|Holler]]\"/\"[[Let Love Lead the Way]]\", setting a record for most UK number ones by a girl group of all time. By the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. Since then, they have reunited for a performance at the [[2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony]] and for two concert tours: [[The Return of the Spice Girls Tour]] from 2007 to 2008 as a five-piece and the [[Spice World – 2019 Tour|Spice World — 2019 UK Tour]], without Beckham. Both tours won the [[Billboard Live Music Awards|''Billboard'' Live Music Award]] for highest-grossing engagements, making the Spice Girls the top touring all-female group from 1998 to 2020.\n\nThe Spice Girls have won five [[Brit Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], four [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], three [[MTV Europe Music Award]]s and one [[MTV Video Music Award]]. In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music]]. Notable elements of the Spice Girls' symbolism include Halliwell's [[Union Jack dress]] and the nicknames that were given to each member of the group by the British press. Numerous [[Spice Girls merchandise and sponsorship deals|endorsement deals and merchandise]] brought the group additional success, with a global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998.{{refn|name=earnings|group=nb|The group was also estimated to have made $300 million in music and video sales from October 1997 to October 1998,<ref name=brandweek/> and over £300 million ($500 million) from merchandising in 1997.<ref name=bbcearnings/><ref name=herald/> In November 1997, the British press estimated that the Spice Girls had amassed personal fortunes of at least £21 million ($34 million) each.<ref name=herald>{{cite news|first1=Jacqueline|last1=McArthur|first2=Daniel|last2=Dasey|author3=AAP|author-link3=Australian Associated Press|title=Impulse sales rush to $10m mark|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|date=11 January 1998|page=6 |id={{ProQuest|367117367}}}}</ref><ref name=\"ginger spice 2\"/>}} According to the ''[[Music Week]]'' writer [[Paul Gorman]], their media exposure helped usher in an era of [[celebrity culture|celebrity obsession]] in pop culture.",
