  "name": "Paul Ngozi",
  "description": "'''Paul Ngozi''' (born '''Paul Dobson Nyirongo'''; January 10, 1949 – 1989) was a [[Zambia]]n musician who was prominent in the [[Music of Zambia|Zambian music]] scene in the 1970s and 1980s. He first became popular as the band leader of the Ngozi Family, a top local rock group which was one of the first groups to have its music classified as [[Zamrock]]. \n\nHe earned his place as a ‘sharp’ social commentator because the themes of his music were usually very close to society’s own lives and therefore easy to relate to. He is listed at number 81 of the most popular Zambians by ''The Zambian online'' newspaper. He died in 1989 from what seemed to be “AIDS related causes”.",
