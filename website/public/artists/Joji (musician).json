Miller began producing Filthy Frank videos in 2012, during his college enrollment in the United States. The channels, which featured [[comedy hip hop]], rants, extreme challenges, and [[ukulele]] and dance performances, are noted for their [[shock humor]] and prolific virality. Miller popularised the [[Harlem Shake (meme)|Harlem Shake]], an [[Internet meme]] that contributed to the commercial success of [[Baauer]]'s song \"[[Harlem Shake (song)|Harlem Shake]]\" and led him to further prominence on YouTube.

He signed with [[88Rising]] and [[12Tone Music Group]] to release his first two studio albums, ''[[Ballads 1]]'' (2018) and ''[[Nectar (Joji album)|Nectar]]'' (2020), both of which peaked at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the singles \"[[Slow Dancing in the Dark]]\" and \"[[Sanctuary (Joji song)|Sanctuary]]\".
