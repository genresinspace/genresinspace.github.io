He was born in [[Wisconsin]] to parents of Italian and [[Polish Americans|Polish]] origin and enjoyed a career spanning four decades of concerts, recordings, television, motion pictures and endorsements. At the height of his fame from the 1950s to 1970s, he was the highest-paid entertainer in the world with established [[concert residencies]] in Las Vegas and an international touring schedule.\n\nHe became popular with general audiences due to performances that included showmanship and elaborate costumes and choreography. His critical reception was mixed, with some believing his playing was flashy but lacking in depth.\n\nIn 1959, Liberace successfully sued the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' for libel after they published an article implying that he was homosexual (which was [[Criminalization of homosexuality|criminalized]] at the time). Later, in 1982, he was sued by his lover and chauffer, [[Scott Thorson]], for palimony. He continued to deny that he was homosexual.",
