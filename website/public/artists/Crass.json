  "name": "Crass",
  "description": "'''Crass''' was an English [[art collective]] and [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Epping, Essex]] in 1977 who promoted [[anarchism]] as a political ideology, a lifestyle, and a [[resistance movement]]. Crass popularized the [[anarcho-punk]] movement of the [[punk subculture]], advocating [[direct action]], [[animal rights]], [[feminism]], [[anti-fascism]], and [[environmentalism]]. The band employed and advocated a [[DIY ethic]] in its albums, [[sound collage]]s, leaflets, and films.\n\nCrass spray-painted stencilled [[graffiti]] messages in the [[London Underground|London subway]] system and on advertising-billboards, coordinated [[Squatting|squats]] and organized political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing and using a stage backdrop amalgamating [[icon]]s of perceived authority such as the [[Christian cross]], the [[swastika]], the [[Union Jack]], and the [[ouroboros]].\n\nThe band was critical of the punk subculture and [[youth culture]] in general; nevertheless, the anarchist ideas that they promoted have maintained a presence in punk. Because of their free experimentation and use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry, and improvisation, Crass has been associated with [[avant-punk]] and [[art punk]].",
