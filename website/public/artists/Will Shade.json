  "description": "'''William Shade Jr.''' (February 5, 1893 â€“ September 18, 1966) was a [[Memphis blues]] musician, best known for his leadership of the [[Memphis Jug Band]]. He was commonly called '''Son Brimmer''', a nickname from his grandmother Annie Brimmer (''son'' is short for ''grandson''). The name apparently stuck when other members of the band noticed that the ''sun'' bothered him and he used the ''brim'' of a hat to ''shade'' his eyes.",
