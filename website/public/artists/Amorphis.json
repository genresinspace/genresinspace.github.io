  "description": "'''Amorphis''' is a Finnish [[progressive metal]] band founded by Jan Rechberger, Tomi Koivusaari, and Esa Holopainen in 1990. Initially, the band was a [[death metal]] act, but on later albums they evolved into playing other genres, including progressive metal, [[folk metal]], and [[melodic death metal]]. They frequently use the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the epic poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.",
