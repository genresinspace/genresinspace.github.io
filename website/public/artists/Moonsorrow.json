  "description": "'''Moonsorrow''' is a Finnish [[pagan metal]] band formed in [[Helsinki]] in 1995. Musically, the band incorporates elements of [[black metal]] and [[folk metal]] in their sound.  The band call their sound \"epic heathen metal\" and try to distance themselves from the term \"[[Viking metal]]\". They have distanced themselves from other folk metal bands, emphasising that their music is [[Neopaganism|pagan]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] and is challenging for its listeners, rather than happy or danceable. The band members have varying levels of pagan belief but they draw on pagan spirituality for lyrics and inspiration.",
