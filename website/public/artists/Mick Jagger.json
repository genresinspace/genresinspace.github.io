  "description": "'''Sir Michael Philip Jagger''' (born 26 July 1943) is an English musician. He is known as the lead singer and one of the founder members of [[the Rolling Stones]]. Jagger has co-written most of the band's songs with lead guitarist [[Keith Richards]]; [[Jagger–Richards|their songwriting partnership]] is one of the most successful in rock music history. His career has spanned more than six decades, and he has been widely described as one of the most popular and influential front men in the [[history of rock music]]. His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones' trademark throughout the band's career. Early in his career, Jagger gained notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use, and has often been portrayed as a [[counterculture|countercultural]] figure.\n\nJagger was born and grew up in [[Dartford]]. He studied at the [[London School of Economics]] before abandoning his studies to focus on his career with the Rolling Stones. In the early 1970s, Jagger starred in the films ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' (1970) and ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), to mixed receptions. Beginning in the 1980s, he released a number of solo works, including four albums and the single \"[[Dancing in the Street#David Bowie and Mick Jagger version|Dancing in the Street]]\", [[Dancing in the Street#David Bowie and Mick Jagger version|a 1985 duet]] with [[David Bowie]] that reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK and Australia and was a top-ten hit in other countries.\n\nIn the 2000s, Jagger co-founded a film production company, Jagged Films, and produced feature films through the company beginning with the 2001 historical drama ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]''. He was also a member of the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[SuperHeavy]] from 2009 to 2011. Although relationships with his bandmates, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, Jagger has always found more success with the Rolling Stones than with his solo and side projects. He was married to [[Bianca Jagger|Bianca Pérez-Mora Macias]] from 1971 to 1978, and has had several other relationships; he has eight children with five women.\n\nIn 1989, Jagger was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and, in 2004, into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] with the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones and as a solo artist, he reached No.&nbsp;1 on the UK and US singles charts with 13 singles, the top 10 with 32 singles and the [[top 40]] with 70 singles. In 2003, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to popular music. Jagger is credited with being a trailblazer in pop music and with bringing a style and sex appeal to rock and roll that have been imitated and proven influential with subsequent generations of musicians.",
