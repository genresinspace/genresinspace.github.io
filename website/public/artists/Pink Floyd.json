  "description": "'''Pink Floyd''' are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experiments, philosophical lyrics, and elaborate [[Pink Floyd live performances|live performances]], and became a leading [[progressive rock]] band.\n\nPink Floyd were founded in 1965 by [[Syd Barrett]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Nick Mason]] (drums), [[Roger Waters]] (bass guitar, vocals) and [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] (keyboards, vocals). With Barrett as their main songwriter, they released two hit singles, \"[[Arnold Layne]]\" and \"[[See Emily Play]]\", and the successful debut studio album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' (all 1967). [[David Gilmour]] (guitar, vocals) joined in 1967; Barrett left in 1968 due to deteriorating mental health.\n\nFollowing Barrett's departure, all four remaining members contributed compositions, though Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the [[concept album|concepts]] behind Pink Floyd's most successful studio albums, ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979). The musical film based on ''The Wall'', ''[[Pink Floyd â€“ The Wall]]'' (1982), won two [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTAs]]. Pink Floyd also composed several [[film score]]s.\n\nPersonal tensions led to Wright leaving the band in 1981, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the studio albums ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994), both backed by major tours. In 2005, Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited with Waters for a performance at the global awareness event [[Live&nbsp;8]]. Barrett died in 2006, as did Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, ''[[The Endless River]]'' (2014), was based on unreleased material from the ''Division Bell'' recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song \"[[Hey, Hey, Rise Up!]]\" in protest of the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]].\n\nBy 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250&nbsp;million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].
