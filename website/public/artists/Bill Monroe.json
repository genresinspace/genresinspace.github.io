Because of this, he is often called the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|Father of Bluegrass]]\".\n\nThe genre takes its name from his band, the '''Blue Grass Boys''', who named their group for the [[Poa pratensis|bluegrass]] of Monroe's home state of [[Kentucky]]. He described the genre as \"Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound.\"",
