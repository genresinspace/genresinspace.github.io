  "description": "'''William Smith Monroe''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|n|ˈ|r|oʊ}} {{respell|mən|ROH}}; September 13, 1911 – September 9, 1996) was an American [[mandolin]]ist, singer, and songwriter who created the [[bluegrass music]] genre. For this reason, he is often called the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#M|Father of Bluegrass]]\".\n\nThe genre takes its name from his band, the '''Blue Grass Boys''', who named their group for the [[Poa pratensis|bluegrass]] of Monroe's home state of [[Kentucky]]. He described the genre as \"Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound.\"",
