  "name": "Little Walter",
  "description": "'''Marion Walter Jacobs''' (May 1, 1930 â€“ February 15, 1968), known as '''Little Walter''', was an American [[blues]] musician, singer, and songwriter, whose revolutionary approach to the [[harmonica]] had a strong impact on succeeding generations, earning him comparisons to such seminal artists as [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. His virtuosity and musical innovations fundamentally altered many listeners' expectations of what was possible on blues harmonica. He was inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2008, the first and, to date, only artist to be inducted specifically as a harmonica player.",
