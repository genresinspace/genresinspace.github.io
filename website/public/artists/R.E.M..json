  "name": "R.E.M.",
  "description": "'''R.E.M.''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Athens, Georgia]], in 1980 by drummer [[Bill Berry]], guitarist [[Peter Buck]], bassist [[Mike Mills]], and lead vocalist [[Michael Stipe]], who were students at the [[University of Georgia]]. R.E.M. was noted for Buck's [[arpeggiated]] \"[[jangle]]\" guitar playing; Stipe's distinctive vocal style, unique stage presence, and cryptic lyrics; Mills's [[Counter-melody|countermelodic]] bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming. In the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] named R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left in 1997, the remaining members continued with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011, having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music acts]].\n\nThe band released their first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, their first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. Over the course of the decade, R.E.M. released acclaimed albums, commencing with their debut ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), and continuing yearly with ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'' (1984), ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'' (1985), ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'' (1986), and ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' (1987). During their most successful period, they worked with the producer [[Scott Litt]]. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]] following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". They signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, releasing ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'' later that year, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing arenas worldwide.\n\nR.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock at the time. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\" was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time [[List of largest music deals|the most expensive recording contract ever]]. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year for health reasons, and Stipe, Buck and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as the multi-instrumentalists [[Scott McCaughey]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] and the drummers [[Joey Waronker]] and [[Bill Rieflin]]. They also parted ways with their longtime manager [[Jefferson Holt]], at which point the band's attorney [[Bertis Downs IV|Bertis Downs]] assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Litt, and hired as co-producer [[Pat McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]], who had worked as mixer and engineer on the band's previous two albums. After the [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]] direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998), which was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001), referred to as \"a conscious return to their classic sound\", received general acclaim.\n\nIn 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in their first year of eligibility. Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony, and to record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[Number 9 Dream|#9 Dream]]\" for the 2007 compilation album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' to benefit [[Amnesty International]]'s campaign to alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]]. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band collaborated with the producer [[Jacknife Lee]] on their final two studio albums—the well-received ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011). In 2024, the band reunited to perform \"Losing My Religion\" at their induction into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and once again in 2025 to perform \"[[Pretty Persuasion (song)|Pretty Persuasion]]\" at the [[40 Watt Club]] in Athens.",
