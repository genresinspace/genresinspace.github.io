  "description": "'''Elvis de Oliveira''', better known as '''E-Life''', is a [[Hip hop music|rapper]] from [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. He is also a [[DJ]] for radio station [[Juize|Juize FM]].\n\nE-Life started his music career with rap crew [[Dope Syndicate]]. [[DJ Raw Deal's]] move to the United States in 1995 prompted E-Life to go solo, touring through [[Europe]]. His first solo single, ''Stacked With Honors'', came out a year later, in 1996. The song received a lot of airplay on the radio, but didn't make it to the charts. It was nominated for best hiphop song for the 1997 [[TMF Awards]], and it allowed E-Life to perform with [[LL Cool J]], [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop Doggy Dogg]], [[Ice Cube]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Blackstreet]] and [[Run DMC]].\n\nHis second single, ''More Days To Come'' (1998) was E-Life's biggest hit, reaching sixth place in the Dutch charts. Its successors ''I Wonder Why'' and ''In Doubt '99'' (both 1999) didn't make it to the Dutch charts, while ''K.I.T.A. (Bring It On)'' would drop from the charts after two weeks.\n\nHis second album, ''E=MCÂ²'', was distributed throughout [[Europe]]. The album features contributions from [[Michael Franti]] and [[Postmen (band)|Postmen]].\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, E-Life acted as the musical sidekick to comic [[Tom Rhodes]] on the late-night talk show [[Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes]] which aired on the Dutch [[Yorin]] television station.\n\nSince 2011, he's a member of the act [[Evil Activities]].",
