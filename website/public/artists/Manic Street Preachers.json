They form a key part of the 1990s Welsh [[Cool Cymru]] cultural movement. The band's early releases were in a [[Punk rock|punk]] vein, eventually broadening to a wider [[alternative rock]] sound. Their early combination of [[androgynous]] [[glam rock|glam]] imagery and lyrics about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" gained them a loyal following.\n\nAs a four-piece with [[Richey Edwards]] (guitar/lyrics), the band's first charting single was \"[[Motown Junk]]\" in 1991, followed by their first two albums, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]'' in 1992 and ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]'' in 1993. 1994's ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' was the last album with Edwards, who disappeared in February 1995 and was legally [[Presumption of death|presumed deceased]] in 2008.

The follow-up album, 1998's ''[[This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours]]'', reached No. 1.\n\nThe Manics have headlined festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T in the Park]], [[V Festival]] and [[Reading Festival|Reading]], winning eleven [[NME Awards|''NME'' Awards]], eight [[Q (magazine)|Q Awards]] and four [[BRIT Awards]].
