After years of obscurity and a part-time music career, Bradley came to prominence in his early 50s. His performances and recording style were consistent with the revivalist approach of his main label [[Daptone Records]], celebrating the feel of funk and soul from the 1960s and 1970s.  One review said he \"echoes the evocative delivery of [[Otis Redding]]\".\n\nCalled \"The Screaming Eagle of Soul,\" Bradley was the subject of the documentary ''Soul of America'' which premiered at [[South by Southwest]] in 2012. He died in 2017 following a long illness.",
