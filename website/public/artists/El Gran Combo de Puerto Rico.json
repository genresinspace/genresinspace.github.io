  "description": "'''El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico''', commonly known as '''El Gran Combo''',  is a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[salsa music|salsa]] orchestra based in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2012, it has often been considered to be [[Puerto Rico]]'s most successful musical group. The group received the moniker ''La Universidad de la Salsa'' (The University of Salsa) in Colombia, due to the sheer number of famous salsa musicians and singers who developed their careers with it, who started with the group (particularly [[Andy Montañez]]), or who were occasionally backed up by the band and [[La India]].\n\nThe [[salsa music|salsa]] orchestra was founded in May 1962, by [[Rafael Ithier]]. Ithier was still nominally its musical director, and was the only remaining member from the band's original lineup. From 2010 until his death in 2022, Willie Sotelo, who joined the group in 2006 as pianist, had become the band's ''de facto'' musical director on tours, with Ithier conducting the group and playing occasionally in select live performances. They are still actively performing after 50 years together. The group was scheduled to celebrate its 50th anniversary on 11 November 2012 at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico]]. The group started its celebration with a grand world tour that took them to five continents.\n\nOn November 24, 2022, El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico, on its 60th anniversary, was featured on Norberto Vélez's YouTube channel titled \"Sesiones Desde La Loma Ep. 32\". El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico is the first Orchestra featured at the hill.",
