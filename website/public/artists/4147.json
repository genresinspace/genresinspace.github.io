  "description": "'''Jon Hassell''' (March 22, 1937 â€“ June 26, 2021) was an American [[trumpet]] player and [[composer]]. He was best known for developing the concept of \"Fourth World\" music, which describes a \"unified primitive/futurist sound\" combining elements of various [[world music|world ethnic]] traditions with modern [[electronic music|electronic]] techniques. The concept was first articulated on ''[[Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics]]'', his 1980 collaboration with [[Brian Eno]].\n\nBorn in Tennessee, Hassell studied contemporary [[classical music]] in New York and later in Germany under composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. He subsequently worked with [[minimal music|minimalist]] composers [[Terry Riley]] (on a 1968 recording of ''[[In C]]'') and [[La Monte Young]] (as part of his [[Theatre of Eternal Music]] group), and studied under Hindustani singer [[Pandit Pran Nath]]. His association with [[Brian Eno]] in the early 1980s would introduce Hassell to a larger audience. He subsequently worked with musical artists such as [[Talking Heads]], [[David Sylvian]], [[Farafina]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tears for Fears]], [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Techno Animal]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Moritz von Oswald]], and [[Carl Craig]].",
