  "description": "'''Kiss''' (commonly styled as '''KISS''') was an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in New York City in 1973 by [[Paul Stanley]] (vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Gene Simmons]] (vocals, bass guitar), [[Ace Frehley]] (lead guitar, vocals) and [[Peter Criss]] (drums, vocals). Known for their [[face paint]] and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with [[shock rock]]–style live performances which featured fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and [[pyrotechnics]]. The band went through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons remaining the only consistent members. The final lineup consisted of them, [[Tommy Thayer]] (lead guitar, vocals) and [[Eric Singer]] (drums, vocals).\n\nWith their makeup and costumes, the band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). During the second half of the 1970s, Kiss became one of America's most successful rock bands and a pop culture phenomenon. Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980, followed by Frehley's departure in 1982. They were replaced by [[Eric Carr]] (the Fox) and [[Vinnie Vincent]] (the Wiz), respectively. The band's commercial success had declined during the early 1980s before experiencing a resurgence in 1983, when they began performing without makeup and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's \"unmasked\" era that would last until 1996. The first album of this era, 1983's [[platinum-certified]] ''[[Lick It Up]]'', successfully introduced them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos received regular airplay on [[MTV]]. Vincent left the band in 1984, being replaced briefly by [[Mark St. John]] before [[Bruce Kulick]] joined the band for the next twelve years. Eric Carr died in 1991 of [[heart cancer]] and was replaced by [[Eric Singer]].\n\nIn response to a wave of Kiss [[nostalgia]] in the mid-1990s, the original lineup reunited in 1996, which also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting [[Alive/Worldwide Tour|1996–1997 reunion tour]] was highly successful, grossing $143.7&nbsp;million, making it the band's most successful tour. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again following the [[Kiss Farewell Tour|2000–2001 tour]], which at the time was intended to be Kiss's last. Criss and Frehley were replaced by Singer and [[Tommy Thayer]], who adopted the original Catman and Spaceman makeup respectively, rather than having their own unique makeup designs. In January 2019, Kiss began its [[End of the Road World Tour|final worldwide tour]], and retired after performing their final show in New York City in December 2023.\n\nKiss is regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, as well as [[List of best-selling music artists|one of the best selling bands of all time]], claiming to have sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including 21 million [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified albums. Kiss has also earned 30 Gold albums, the most of any band from the United States. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, three of which earned multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Kiss was ranked by [[MTV]] as the ninth \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\", placed tenth on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list, as well as being ranked as the third \"Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time\" by ''[[Loudwire]]'' magazine and placed sixteenth by the British magazine ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' on their \"The 50 Best Rock Bands of All Time\" list.",
