  "name": "Dr. Feelgood",
  "description": "'''Dr. Feelgood''' are an English [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] band formed in 1971. Hailing from [[Canvey Island]], [[Essex]], they are best known for early singles such as \"[[She Does It Right]]\", \"[[Roxette (song)|Roxette]]\", \"[[Back in the Night]]\" and \"[[Milk and Alcohol]]\". Their original and distinctively British [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] sound was centred on [[Wilko Johnson]]'s choppy guitar style. Along with Johnson, the initial band line-up included singer [[Lee Brilleaux]] and the [[rhythm section]] of John B. Sparks, known as \"Sparko\", on bass guitar and John Martin, known as \"The Big Figure\", on drums. Although their most commercially productive years were the mid to late-1970s, and in spite of Brilleaux's death in 1994, a version of the band (featuring none of the original members) continue to tour and record.",
