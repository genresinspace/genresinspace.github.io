  "description": "'''Kleptomaniax''' is a [[Hip-hop music|rap]] group from [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The group consists of three members: Roba (Robert Manyasa), Collo (Collins Majale) and [[Nyashinski]] (Nyamari Ongegu).\n\nKleptomaniax were formed in 1999, when they were still high school students at the [[Nairobi School]]. The group joined the [[Ogopa DJs]] label and released their first single, \"Freak It\" in 2002, which was followed by \"Maniax Anthem\" and \"Haree.\" In 2004 the group released another single \"Tuendelee\", which became their biggest hit so far. The song was written as a response for the \"[[Diss track]]\" by various hip hop musicians (including [[Bamboo (lyricist)|Bamboo]]), who criticised the commercial [[Kapuka rap|Kapuka music style]] performed by Kleptomaniax among others.\n\nTheir debut album ''M4E'' (an abbreviation for ''Maniax Forever'') was released in 2005. Later that year the group received an [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] nomination for the Best African Act, a category awarded for the first time, but won by [[Nigerian]] [[recording artist]] [[2Face Idibia]]. In 2007 Kleptomaniax toured the US. The group was managed by Fakii Liwali.\n\nAfter 2007, the group had a break while their members engaged in solo projects. The group has since made a comeback but has left Ogopa DJs. The group released their second album ''NITT'' (Now Is The Time) in 2009. The group was believed to have disbanded after the release of their second album to pursue solo careers.\n\nInfluential group member Nyashinski  made a successful comeback in 2016 and his song 'Malaika' scooped a Mdundo Award for [https://kenyanmusik.co.ke/blog/nyashinski-willy-paul-mercy-masika-shine-mdundo-awards-2018-full-list-winners/ Most Downloaded Male Single in 2017]\n\nCollo remained on the scene as a solo act and has since transitioned to a gospel artist",
