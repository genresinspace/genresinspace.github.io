  "description": "'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Hawthorne, California]], in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and their friend [[Al Jardine]]. Distinguished by their [[vocal harmonies]], adolescent-oriented lyrics, and musical ingenuity, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. The group drew on the music of [[Traditional pop|older pop]] [[vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and black [[R&B]] to create their unique sound. Under Brian's direction, they often incorporated [[classical music|classical]] or [[jazz]] elements and pioneered [[Recording studio as an instrument|unconventional recording techniques]] in innovative ways.\n\nThey formed as a [[garage band]] centered on Brian's songwriting and managed by the Wilsons' father, [[Murry Wilson|Murry]]. Jardine was briefly replaced by [[David Marks]] during 1962–1963. In 1962, they enjoyed their first national hit with \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\", beginning a [[The Beach Boys discography#1960s|string of hit singles]] that reflected a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, dubbed the \"[[California sound]]\". They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the [[British Invasion]]. 1965 saw the addition of [[Bruce Johnston]] to the band, as well as Brian's move away from beach-going themes for more introspective lyrics and ambitious studio productions. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators; both are now widely considered to be among the greatest and most influential works in [[popular music]] history.\n\nAfter shelving the ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates. In the late 1960s, the group's commercial momentum faltered in the U.S., and they were frequently dismissed by the [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock music press]]. Rebranding themselves in the early 1970s, [[Blondie Chaplin]] and [[Ricky Fataar]] of [[the Flames]] briefly joined their lineup while Johnston left the band before rejoining in the late 1970s. Carl took over as ''[[de facto]]'' leader until the mid-1970s, when the band responded to the growing success of their live shows and [[greatest hits]] compilations by becoming an [[oldies]] touring act. Brian would return as producer for ''[[15 Big Ones]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Beach Boys Love You]]'' (1977) after which his contributions again became sporadic. Dennis drowned in 1983, and Brian became estranged from the group in the late 1990s. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, Jardine left the band while Love was granted legal rights to [[The Beach Boys (touring band)|tour under the group's name]] and continued performing with Johnston and, occasionally, Marks. In the early 2010s, the surviving original members, alongside Marks and Johnston, briefly reunited for the album ''[[That's Why God Made the Radio]]'' (2012) and a [[The 50th Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour]]. Brian died in 2025 of respiratory arrest.\n\nThe Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and [[List of best-selling music artists|commercially successful bands]] of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize popular music as a recognized art form, and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], [[power pop]], [[progressive rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. Between the 1960s and 2020s, the group had 37 songs reach the U.S. [[Top 40]] of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (the most by an American band), with four topping the chart. In 2004, the group was ranked number 12 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|greatest artists of all time]], the highest ranking of any American band. Many critics' polls have ranked ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' (1963), ''[[The Beach Boys Today!]]'' (1965), ''Pet Sounds'', ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'' (both 1967), ''[[Friends (The Beach Boys album)|Friends]]'' (1968), ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' (1970), ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971), and the archival compilation box set ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) among the finest albums in history. The founding members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988.",
