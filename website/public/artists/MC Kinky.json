  "description": "'''Caron Liza Geary''' (born 15 October 1963 in [[Paddington]], London), known by various stage names, is an English female [[ragga]]muffin [[Deejay (Jamaican)#Toasting|toaster]]. She was the world's first white female reggae/dancehall MC, and the first dancehall MC ever, to chat reggae-inspired lyrics over house music.\n\nAccording to Geary, her first recorded track was over the dub version of \"Kid Ralph\", a dancehall track by Little Twitch. The song, unbeknown to her, spoke about a \"legendary\" homosexual figure in [[Jamaica]]'s prison system. Her track was called \"Reggae gone Kinky\" and the dubplate was recorded at Music House in Finsbury Park. She has subsequently worked as a solo artist and with other musicians, including [[Erasure (duo)|Erasure]] and [[Boy George]], who described her music as \"the dirtiest 'slackest' reggae I'd heard since the seventies\".",
