  "description": "'''Dead or Alive''' were an English [[Pop music|pop]] band who released seven studio albums from 1984 to 2000. The band formed in 1979 in [[Liverpool]] and found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the [[UK Top 40]] and three albums in the UK Top 30. At the peak of their success, the line-up consisted of [[Pete Burns]] (vocals), Steve Coy (drums), Mike Percy (bass), and Tim Lever (keyboards), with the core pair of Burns and Coy writing and producing for the remainder of the band's career due to Percy and Lever exiting the group in 1988. In 2010, the moniker of the band was definitely archived, and Burns issued a solo single. Following Burns' death on October 23, 2016, the band ended.\n\nIn 2021, ''[[Fan the Flame (Part 2): The Resurrection]]'', a \"lost\" album recorded in the nineties, was completed and issued for the very first time.\n\nTwo of the band's singles reached the US Top 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" (No.&nbsp;11 in August 1985), and \"[[Brand New Lover]]\" (No.&nbsp;15 in March 1987). \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" peaked at No. 1 for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns's appearance on the television reality show ''[[Big Brother (UK)#Celebrity Big Brother|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' and on [[Stranger Things (season 4)|season 4]] of ''[[Stranger Things]]''. It also became the first of two singles to top the ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart. In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked them as the 96th most successful dance artist of all time.",
