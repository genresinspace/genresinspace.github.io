It is one of two (with [[Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble]]) popular music groups that were established by North Korea in the 1980s, both named after places where [[Kim Il Sung]] fought the Japanese in 1930s. It takes its name from [[Mount Wangjae]] in [[Onsong County|Onsong-gun]], [[North Hamgyong Province]], on the border with [[People's Republic of China|China]] (Japan puppet state [[Manchukuo]] in that period), where [[Kim Il Sung]] is said to have held a meeting for anti-Japanese activities in 1933.\n\nThe band was established by the North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]], son and heir of Kim Il Sung, on 22 July 1983. Its music was often broadcast over [[Media of North Korea|Korean Central Broadcasting Station]] channels such as [[Voice of Korea|Radio Pyongyang]] and as [[test card music]] for [[Korean Central Television]]. The Wangjaesan Dance Troupe is part of the group.",
