  "description": "'''Tribu Baharú''' is a [[Champeta|champeta criolla]] and [[world music]] band from [[Bogotá]], Colombia. The band has been an important force in the revival and international visibility of the Champeta sound, which originates from the Colombian Caribbean coast and is marked by lively rhythms, laced with African influences.\n\nChampeta was overshadowed by the more popular [[Reggaeton]] in the '90s. However, Tribu Baharú is among a wave of new Colombian music groups based in Bogotá who are reestablishing Champeta as a vital musical style and adding more elements to this genre.",
