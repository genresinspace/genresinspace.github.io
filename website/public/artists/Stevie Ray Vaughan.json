Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is considered one of the most influential musicians in the history of [[blues]] music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was the younger brother of guitarist [[Jimmie Vaughan]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Dallas]], Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his brother Jimmie. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with [[Tommy Shannon]] on bass and [[Chris Layton]] on drums as Double Trouble in 1978. The band established itself in the [[Austin music scene]] and soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. They performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in July 1982, where [[David Bowie]] saw Vaughan play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig in December where he played blues guitar on the album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983). [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]] heard a demo album that Vaughan and Double Trouble had recorded and interested major label [[Epic Records]] in signing them to a record deal in March 1983. Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Texas Flood]]''. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.\n\nVaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction for most of his life. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora \"Lenny\" Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album ''[[In Step]]'' reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan's most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number-one hit, \"Crossfire\". He became one of the world's most popular blues performers, and he headlined [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1989 and the [[Beale Street Music Festival]] in 1990.\n\nOn August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were [[Death of Stevie Ray Vaughan|killed in a helicopter crash]] in [[East Troy, Wisconsin]], after performing with Double Trouble at [[Alpine Valley Music Theatre]]. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error. Vaughan's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15&nbsp;million albums in the United States alone. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has twice ranked him among the top twenty guitar players of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, and [[Reese Wynans]].",
