Sumner, Hook and Morris were then known for being members of [[Joy Division]], which had disbanded earlier in 1980 after the suicide of lead singer [[Ian Curtis]]. Their fusion of [[post-punk]] and [[electronic dance music]] made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. They became the flagship band for the [[Manchester]]-based independent record label [[Factory Records]] and its nightclub, [[The Ha√ßienda]]. They worked in a long-term collaboration with graphic designer [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] who worked on their album covers.\n\nWhile the band's early years were initially overshadowed by Joy Division's post-punk legacy, their experience in the early 1980s [[New York City|New York]] club scene led them to incorporate dance rhythms and [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]ation into their work. Their 1983 hit \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\" became the best-selling [[12-inch single]] of all time and a popular [[club music|club]] track. In the 1980s, they released several successful albums, such as ''[[Power, Corruption & Lies]]'' (1983), ''[[Technique (album)|Technique]]'' (1989), and the [[Single (music)|singles]] compilation album ''[[Substance 1987|Substance]]'' (1987). The band disbanded in 1993 to focus on their individual projects but reunited in 1998. Since then, New Order have gone through various hiatuses and changes in personnel, most notably the departure of [[Peter Hook|Hook]] in 2007 due to personal disputes with the other members. In 2015, they released their tenth studio album, ''[[Music Complete]].'' In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].",
