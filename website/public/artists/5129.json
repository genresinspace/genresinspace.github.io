The band primarily consisted of vocalist [[Chrissy Amphlett]] and guitarist [[Mark McEntee]].

The band was inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008. Divinyls broke up in 2009, and Amphlett died in 2013.\n\nDivinyls released five studio albums—four placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (''[[Divinyls (album)|Divinyls]]'') reached No.&nbsp;15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada.
