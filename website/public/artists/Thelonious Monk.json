  "description": "'''Thelonious Sphere Monk''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n|i|ə|s}} October 10, 1917 – February 17, 1982) was an American [[Jazz piano|jazz pianist]] and [[composer]]. He had a unique [[improvisation]]al style and made numerous contributions to the [[Jazz standard|standard]] jazz repertoire, including \"[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]\", \"[[Blue Monk]]\", \"[[Straight, No Chaser (composition)|Straight, No Chaser]]\", \"[[Ruby, My Dear (composition)|Ruby, My Dear]]\", \"[[In Walked Bud]]\", and \"[[Well, You Needn't]]\". Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after [[Duke Ellington]].\n\nMonk's compositions and improvisations feature [[consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] and angular [[melodic]] twists, often using flat ninths, flat fifths, unexpected [[chromatic notes]] together, low bass notes and stride, and fast [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] runs, combining a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.\n\nMonk's distinct look included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He also had an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano.\n\nMonk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' (the others being [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Duke Ellington]], and [[Wynton Marsalis]]).   Monk’s composition ‘Round Midnight’ is widely recognized as the most recorded jazz standard composed by a single artist, with hundreds of versions by musicians across multiple generations.",
