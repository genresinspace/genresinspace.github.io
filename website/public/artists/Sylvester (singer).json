  "description": "'''Sylvester James Jr.''' (September 6, 1947{{spaced ndash}}December 16, 1988), known simply as '''Sylvester''', was an American singer-songwriter. Primarily active in the genres of [[disco]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[soul music|soul]], he was known for his flamboyant and [[androgynous]] appearance, [[falsetto]] singing voice, and hit disco singles in the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\nBorn in [[Watts, Los Angeles]], to a middle-class African-American family, Sylvester developed a love of singing through the [[gospel choir]] of his [[Pentecostal]] church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship among a group of [[Black people|Black]] [[cross-dressers]] and [[transgender women]] who called themselves the Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and joined the avant-garde [[Drag queen|drag]] troupe [[the Cockettes]], producing solo segments of their shows, which were heavily influenced by female [[blues]] and [[jazz]] singers such as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Josephine Baker]]. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on [[Blue Thumb Records]] in 1973 before disbanding.\n\n\nFocusing on a solo career, Sylvester signed a recording contract with [[Harvey Fuqua]] of [[Fantasy Records]] and obtained three new backing singers in the form of [[Martha Wash]] and [[Izora Rhodes]] – the \"[[Two Tons O' Fun]]\" – as well as [[Jeanie Tracy]]. His first solo album, ''[[Sylvester (album)|Sylvester]]'' (1977), was a moderate success. This was followed with the acclaimed disco album ''[[Step II]]'' (1978), which spawned the singles \"[[You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)]]\" and \"[[Dance (Disco Heat)]]\", both of which were hits in the US and Europe. Distancing himself from the disco genre, he recorded four more albums – including a live album – with Fantasy Records. After leaving this label, he signed to [[Megatone Records]], the dance-oriented company founded by friend and collaborator [[Patrick Cowley]], where he recorded four more albums, including the Cowley penned hit [[Hi-NRG]] track \"[[Do Ya Wanna Funk]]\". Sylvester was an activist who campaigned against the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]]. He died from complications arising from the virus in 1988, leaving all future royalties from his work to San Francisco-based HIV/AIDS charities.\n\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Sylvester gained the nickname of the \"Queen of Disco\" and during his life he attained particular recognition in San Francisco, where he was awarded the [[key to the city]]. In 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Dance Music Hall of Fame]], while his life has been recorded in a biography and made the subject of both a documentary and a musical.",
