  "description": "'''Khaled Mohammed Khaled''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|æ|l|ɪ|d}}; born November 26, 1975), known professionally as '''DJ Khaled''', is an American DJ and record producer. Originally a [[Miami]]-based radio personality, Khaled has since become known for enlisting high-profile [[music industry]] artists to perform on singles and albums, for which he often serves as producer and [[hype man]]. Known as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Anthem King]]\", his distinctions are his booming voice presence, \"motivational\" abstractions, maximalist production style and numerous [[catchphrase]]s.\n\nKhaled was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], to Palestinian immigrant parents. He first gained recognition as a radio host in the 1990s for the radio station [[WEDR|99 Jamz]], and translated his popularity by working with [[Fat Joe]]'s hip hop collective, [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]], as a DJ for their live performances and as a producer for the group. Following his production credits on the group's material, Khaled enlisted several hip hop artists associated with the group and his native Miami to perform on his debut studio album, ''[[Listennn... the Album]]'' (2006). His second album, ''[[We the Best]]'' (2007), spawned the hit single \"[[I'm So Hood]]\" (featuring [[T-Pain]], [[Trick Daddy]], [[Rick Ross]] and [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]]). His two subsequent releases—''[[We Global]]'' (2008) and ''[[Victory (DJ Khaled album)|Victory]]'' (2010)—both peaked within the top ten of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; the latter was supported by the single \"[[All I Do Is Win]]\" (featuring T-Pain, [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]] and Rick Ross), which received [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nHis fifth studio album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[We the Best Forever]]'' (2011), saw continued commercial success and brought Khaled to mainstream prominence by spawning his first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]-top ten single, \"[[I'm on One]]\" (featuring [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], Rick Ross and [[Lil Wayne]]). His following three albums—''[[Kiss the Ring]]'' (2012), ''[[Suffering from Success]]'' (2013), and ''[[I Changed a Lot]]'' (2015)—were released to moderate critical and commercial reception. Throughout 2015 and 2016, Khaled gained wider recognition as a public figure due to his social media activity. This, along with several [[Internet memes]], foresaw the release of his ninth studio album, [[Major Key (album)|''Major Key'']] (2016), which was met with further critical and commercial success as it debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200 and was nominated for [[Best Rap Album]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nHis tenth album, ''[[Grateful (DJ Khaled album)|Grateful]]'' (2017), became his second consecutive number-one album and was preceded by the singles \"[[I'm the One (DJ Khaled song)|I'm the One]]\" (featuring [[Justin Bieber]], [[Quavo]], [[Chance the Rapper]] and [[Lil Wayne]]) and \"[[Wild Thoughts]]\" (featuring [[Rihanna]] and [[Bryson Tiller]]), which peaked at numbers one and two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, respectively. His eleventh album, ''[[Father of Asahd]]'' (2019), contained the song \"[[Higher (DJ Khaled song)|Higher]]\" (featuring [[Nipsey Hussle]] and [[John Legend]]), which won [[Best Rap/Sung Performance]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]]—Khaled's first Grammy Award win. His [[Khaled Khaled|eponymous twelfth album]] (2021) and thirteenth album, ''[[God Did]]'' (2022), both debuted atop the ''Billboard'' 200. The latter's [[God Did (song)|title track]] (featuring Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, [[Jay-Z]], John Legend and [[Fridayy]]) earned three nominations at the [[65th Annual Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]]. Khaled is scheduled to release his fourteenth studio album, ''[[Aalam of God]]'', in 2025.\n\nOutside of music, Khaled has gained success as a writer, with his book ''[[The Keys (book)|The Keys]]'' featuring on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. He has also performed as an actor for the films ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'' (2020) and its sequel ''[[Bad Boys: Ride or Die]]'' (2024), and had a voice role in the animated film ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'' (2019). His record label, [[We the Best Music Group]] has distributed his releases since its formation in 2008, though Khaled signed other artists to the imprint including [[Ace Hood]], [[Kent Jones (rapper)|Kent Jones]], [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]], [[Flipp Dinero]], and [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]], among others.",
