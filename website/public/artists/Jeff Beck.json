  "name": "Jeff Beck",
  "description": "'''Geoffrey Arnold Beck''' (24 June 1944 – 10 January 2023) was an English guitarist. He rose to prominence as a member of the rock band [[the Yardbirds]], and afterwards founded and fronted [[the Jeff Beck Group]] and [[Beck, Bogert & Appice]]. In 1975, he switched to an [[instrumental]] style with focus on an innovative sound, and his releases spanned genres and styles ranging from [[blues rock]], [[hard rock]], [[jazz fusion]] and a blend of guitar-rock and [[electronica]].\n\nBeck has been consistently ranked in the top five of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and other magazines' lists of the greatest guitarists. He was often called a \"guitarist's guitarist\". ''Rolling Stone'' described him as \"one of the most influential lead guitarists in rock\". Although he recorded two successful albums (1975's ''[[Blow by Blow]]'' and 1976's ''[[Wired (Jeff Beck album)|Wired]]'') as a solo act, Beck did not establish or maintain commercial success like that of his contemporaries and bandmates. He recorded with many artists.\n\nBeck earned wide critical praise and received the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] six times, winning in three categories at the 2010 Grammy Awards for a career total of eight Grammies. In 2014, he received the British Academy's [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice: first as a member of the Yardbirds (1992) and secondly as a solo artist (2009).",
