  "description": "'''O'Shea Jackson Sr.''' (born June 15, 1969), known professionally as '''Ice Cube''', is an American rapper, songwriter, actor, and film producer. His lyrics on [[N.W.A]]'s 1989 album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' contributed to [[gangsta rap]]'s widespread popularity, and his [[political rap]] solo albums ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' (1990), ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Predator (album)|The Predator]]'' (1992) were all critically and commercially successful. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of N.W.A in 2016.\n\nA native of Los Angeles, Ice Cube formed his first rap group called [[C.I.A. (band)|C.I.A.]] in 1986. In 1987, with [[Eazy-E]] and [[Dr. Dre]], he formed the gangsta rap group N.W.A. As its lead rapper, he wrote some of Dre's and most of Eazy's lyrics on ''Straight Outta Compton'', a landmark album that shaped [[West Coast hip hop]]'s early identity and helped differentiate it from [[East Coast rap]]. N.W.A was also known for their violent lyrics, threatening to attack abusive police which stirred controversy. After a monetary dispute over the group's management by Eazy-E and [[Jerry Heller]], Cube left N.W.A in late 1989, teaming with New York artists and launching a solo rap career.\n\nIce Cube has also had an active film career since the early 1990s. He entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director [[John Singleton]]'s feature debut ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', a 1991 drama named after a [[Boyz-n-the-Hood|1987 rap song]] that Ice Cube wrote. He also co-wrote and starred in the 1995 comedy film ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', which spawned a successful franchise and reshaped his public image into a bankable movie star. He made his directorial debut with the 1998 film ''[[The Players Club]]'', and also produced and curated the film's accompanying [[The Players Club (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]. As of 2020, he has appeared in about 40 films, including the 1999 war comedy ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'', family comedies like the [[Barbershop (film series)|''Barbershop'' series]], and buddy cop comedies ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[22 Jump Street]]'', and ''[[Ride Along (film)|Ride Along]]''.
