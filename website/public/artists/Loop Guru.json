  "name": "Loop Guru",
  "description": "'''Loop Guru''' is a [[worldbeat]] group consisting of bassist/guitarist Salman Gita (born Sam Dodson) and programmer Jamuud (born David Muddyman). They first met around 1980 and initially played together in [[The Transmitters (band)|The Transmitters]] and released their debut single as Loop Guru, \"Shrine\", in 1992. The band's music is a melange of Asian and Western music, infusing Western dance beats with the rich textures and sounds of Indonesian [[gamelan]] and traditional Indian music. Heavy emphasis is placed on electronic samples of traditional instruments, voices, and miscellaneous sounds.\n\nLoop Guru's main exuberant oeuvre of lively rhythms and effusive sounds is occasionally punctuated by more contemplative albums (e.g., ''The Third Chamber'') that are reminiscent and influenced by [[ambient music]] and similar to musical artists such as [[Brian Eno]] and [[Jon Hassell]]. Past and present guest musicians and collaborators include [[Natacha Atlas]], [[Sussan Deyhim]], Mad Jym, Count Dubulah (also known as Nick Page, Psycho Karaoke and Dub Colossus) and Cat von Trapp.\n\nTheir single \"Paradigm Shuffle\", one of their more popular releases, was built around \"[[I Have a Dream]]\", [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s 1963 speech.\n\nMuddyman died on 27 March 2022.",
