They perform mostly in Spanish but also mix in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], French, and languages of southern France, such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]].\n\nAlthough the group members were born in France, their parents were mostly ''[[gitanos]]'' (Spanish [[Romani people|Romani]]) who fled Spain during the 1930s [[Spanish Civil War]]. They are known for bringing [[rumba flamenca]], a pop-oriented music distantly derived from traditional flamenco and [[rumba]], to a worldwide audience, and for their interpretations of English-language pop hits.",
