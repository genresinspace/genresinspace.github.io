  "description": "'''U2''' are an Irish [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Dublin]] in 1976. The group comprises [[Bono]] (lead vocals), [[the Edge]] (lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals), [[Adam Clayton]] (bass guitar), and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in [[post-punk]], U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, [[Effects unit|effects]]-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career.\n\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with [[Island Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'' (1983), and singles \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" and \"[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'' (1984), was their first collaboration with producers [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]], whose influence resulted in a more abstract, [[ambient music|ambient]] sound for the band. By the mid-1980s, U2 had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. Their fifth album, ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. One of the world's [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] with 25 million copies sold, it yielded the group's only number-one singles in the US: \"[[With or Without You]]\" and \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\".\n\nFacing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' (1991), and the multimedia spectacle of the [[Zoo TV Tour]], the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[electronic dance music]], and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued on ''[[Zooropa]]'' (1993) and concluded after ''[[Pop (U2 album)|Pop]]'' (1997) and the [[PopMart Tour]], which polarized audiences and critics. The group re-established a more conventional, mainstream sound on ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'' (2000) and ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' (2004), which were critical and commercial successes. Sales of subsequent albums declined, but the group remained a popular live act. The [[U2 360° Tour]] of 2009–2011 held records for the [[List of most-attended concert tours|most-attended]] and [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tour]] until 2019. ''[[Songs of Innocence (U2 album)|Songs of Innocence]]'' (2014), the first of two companion albums in the 2010s, was criticised for its pervasive release through the [[iTunes Store]]. In 2023, U2 released ''[[Songs of Surrender]]'', an album of re-recorded songs, and began the [[U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere|U2:UV ''Achtung Baby'' Live]] concert residency to inaugurate [[Sphere (venue)|Sphere]] in the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nU2 have released 15 studio albums and are one of the world's [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]], having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. [[List of awards and nominations received by U2|Their accolades]] include 22 [[Grammy Award]]s, eight [[Brit Awards]], four [[Ivor Novello Awards]], and two [[Golden Globe Awards]]. They were inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004 and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2005. According to ''[[Pollstar]]'', they were the [[List of highest-grossing live music artists|second-highest-grossing live music artist]] from 1980 to 2022, earning US$2.13&nbsp;billion. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked U2 at number 22 on its [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"]]. Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, working with organisations and coalitions that include [[Amnesty International]], [[Jubilee 2000]], [[DATA]]/the [[ONE Campaign]], [[Product Red]], [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], and [[Music Rising]].\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}",
