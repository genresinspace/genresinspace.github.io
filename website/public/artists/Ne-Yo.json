  "description": "'''Shaffer Chimere Smith''' (born October 18, 1979), known professionally as '''Ne-Yo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|iː|j|oʊ}} {{respell|NEE|yoh}}), is an American singer-songwriter. Regarded as a leading figure of [[Contemporary R&B#2000s|2000s R&B music]], he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including three [[Grammy Awards]]. He gained recognition for his songwriting abilities following the success of his first major credit, [[Mario (American singer)|Mario]]'s 2004 single \"[[Let Me Love You (Mario song)|Let Me Love You]]\". Its release prompted a meeting between Ne-Yo and [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]]'s then-president [[Jay-Z]], resulting in a contract in which he released four studio albums, each of which spawned [[hit song]]s.\n\nNe-Yo's 2005 debut single, \"[[Stay (Ne-Yo song)|Stay]]\" (featuring [[Peedi Peedi]]) was released the following year to lukewarm commercial reception, though his 2006 single, \"[[So Sick]]\", became his [[breakthrough role|breakthrough]] hit as it peaked atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Both songs, along with the follow-up singles \"[[When You're Mad]]\" and \"[[Sexy Love]]\", preceded the release of his debut studio album ''[[In My Own Words]]'' (2006), which peaked atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and saw positive critical reception. Furthermore, the album yielded two nominations at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]] and received [[RIAA certification|platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), in addition to similar certifications in the UK, Japan and Australia.\n\nHis second and third albums, ''[[Because of You (Ne-Yo album)|Because of You]]'' (2007) and ''[[Year of the Gentleman]]'' (2008), were met with continued success, peaking at numbers one and two on the ''Billboard'' 200, respectively. The former won [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album|Best Contemporary R&B Album]] at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]], while the latter was nominated for the award, as well as for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. They spawned the US-top ten singles \"[[Because of You (Ne-Yo song)|Because of You]]\", \"[[Closer (Ne-Yo song)|Closer]]\", and \"[[Miss Independent (Ne-Yo song)|Miss Independent]]\" — the latter won [[Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]]. ''Year of the Gentleman'' received double platinum certification by the RIAA—selling two million copies—as well as triple platinum certification by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\n''[[Libra Scale]]'' (2010), Ne-Yo's fourth studio album, was met with moderate success on international charts and reached number nine on the US ''Billboard'' 200. Seeing an overall decline in commercial reception, he parted ways with Def Jam in favor of its coequal [[Universal Music Group]] subsidiary, [[Motown]] two years later. His fifth album, ''[[R.E.D. (Ne-Yo album)|R.E.D.]]'' (2012) peaked at number four on the chart and was preceded by the single \"[[Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)]]\", which peaked at number six on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and peaked atop the [[UK Singles Chart]]. His sixth album, ''[[Non-Fiction (Ne-Yo album)|Non-Fiction]]'' (2015) was met with similar commercial response despite a steep critical decline. It was supported by the ''Billboard'' Hot 100-top ten single \"[[Time of Our Lives (Pitbull and Ne-Yo song)|Time of Our Lives]]\" (with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]) and the [[strip club]]-inspired top 40 single, \"[[She Knows (Ne-Yo song)|She Knows]]\" (featuring [[Juicy J]]). His seventh album, ''[[Good Man (album)|Good Man]]'' (2018), peaked at number 33 on the ''Billboard'' 200, while his eighth and ninth albums, ''Another Kind of Christmas'' (2019) and ''[[Self Explanatory (Ne-Yo album)|Self Explanatory]]'' (2022), narrowly entered the chart.\n\nAlongside his recording career, Ne-Yo served as a judge for the [[reality competition]] series ''[[World of Dance (TV series)|World of Dance]]'' from 2017 to 2020 alongside [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Derek Hough]]. In 2021, Ne-Yo competed as Badger on the second season of ''[[The Masked Singer (British TV series)|The Masked Singer UK]],'' and finished in second place. In 2023, he competed on the tenth season of ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]],'' as the Cow and finished in first place. According to [[Recording Industry Association of America]], Ne-Yo has sold 29 million certified albums and singles in the United States. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked \"[[Give Me Everything]]\" and \"[[Knock You Down]]\" among the Greatest Songs of the Summer of all time. Ne-Yo has yielded five number one singles on the UK Singles Chart, and spent 315 weeks within the chart's Top 75. Ne-Yo also has four songs listed on Motown's Top 100 songs of the Millennium in the UK—the fifth most entries on the list.",
