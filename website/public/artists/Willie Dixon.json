  "description": "'''William James Dixon''' (July 1, 1915{{snd}}January 29, 1992) was an American [[blues]] musician, vocalist, songwriter, arranger and record producer. He was proficient in playing both the [[upright bass]] and the guitar, and sang with a distinctive voice, but he is perhaps best known as one of the most prolific songwriters of his time. Next to [[Muddy Waters]], Dixon is recognized as the most influential person in shaping the postâ€“[[World War II]] sound of the [[Chicago blues]].\n\nDixon's songs have been recorded by countless musicians in many genres as well as by various ensembles in which he participated. A short list of his most famous compositions includes \"[[Hoochie Coochie Man]]\", \"[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]\", \"[[Little Red Rooster]]\", \"[[My Babe]]\", \"[[Spoonful]]\", and \"[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]\". These songs were written during the peak years of [[Chess Records]], from 1950 to 1965, and were performed by [[Muddy Waters]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Bo Diddley]]; they influenced a generation of musicians worldwide.\n\nDixon was an important link between the blues and [[rock and roll]], working with [[Little Walter]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Bo Diddley]] in the late 1950s. In the 1960s, his songs were adapted by numerous rock artists. He received a [[Grammy Award]] and was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]], the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].",
