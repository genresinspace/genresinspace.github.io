  "description": "'''The United States of America''' was an American [[experimental rock]] band founded in [[Los Angeles]] in 1967 by composer [[Joseph Byrd]] and vocalist [[Dorothy Moskowitz]], with electric violinist Gordon Marron, bassist Rand Forbes and drummer Craig Woodson. Their [[The United States of America (album)|1968 self-titled album]], often cited as an early showcase for the use of [[electronics in rock music|electronic devices in rock music]], was met with critical acclaim and minor chart success. They disbanded shortly after its release.\n\nThe groupâ€™s sound was grounded in both [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and the [[avant-garde]].  Unusually, the band had no guitar player; instead, they used strings, keyboards and electronics, including primitive [[synthesizer]]s, and various audio processors, including the [[ring modulator]].  Many of the songs' lyrics reflected Byrd's [[leftist]] political views. [[AllMusic]] described them as \"among the most revolutionary bands of the late '60s.\"",
