He is also the co-author of one of the biggest radio hits of the 1990s, [[Gin Blossoms]]'s \"[[Til I Hear It from You]]\". His music has roots in classic [[soul music]] and [[Buddy Holly]], to whom Crenshaw was often compared in the early days of his career, and whom he portrayed in the 1987 film ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]''.\n\nBorn in Michigan, Crenshaw performed in the musical ''[[Beatlemania (musical)|Beatlemania]]'' before releasing his [[Marshall Crenshaw (album)|self-titled album]] in 1982. Crenshaw could not replicate the commercial success of ''Marshall Crenshaw'' and follow-up ''[[Field Day (Marshall Crenshaw album)|Field Day]]'' (1983) with later albums. Crenshaw has also contributed songs to other artists, writing singles for [[Kirsty MacColl]] and Gin Blossoms. A quote from ''[[Trouser Press]]'' summed up Marshall Crenshaw's early career: \"Although he was seen as a latter-day Buddy Holly at the outset, he soon proved too talented and original to be anyone but himself.\"",
