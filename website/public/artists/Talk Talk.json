Initially a [[synth-pop]] group, Talk Talk's first two albums, ''[[The Party's Over (Talk Talk album)|The Party's Over]]'' (1982) and ''[[It's My Life (album)|It's My Life]]'' (1984), reached top 40 in the UK and produced the international hit singles \"[[Talk Talk (Talk Talk song)|Talk Talk]]\", \"[[Today (Talk Talk song)|Today]]\", \"[[It's My Life (Talk Talk song)|It's My Life]]\", and \"[[Such a Shame]]\". \n\nThey achieved widespread critical success in Europe and the UK with the album ''[[The Colour of Spring]]'' (1986) along with its singles \"[[Life's What You Make It (Talk Talk song)|Life's What You Make It]]\" and \"[[Living in Another World]]\". 1988's ''[[Spirit of Eden]]'' moved the group towards a more experimental sound informed by [[jazz]] and improvisation, pioneering what became known as [[post-rock]]; it was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful.\n\nFriction with the band's [[Record label|label]], [[EMI Records|EMI]], resulted in legal action and countersuing. Webb departed, and the band switched to [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] for their final studio album, 1991's ''[[Laughing Stock (album)|Laughing Stock]]'', but split soon afterwards. Singer [[Mark Hollis (musician)|Mark Hollis]] released one solo album in 1998 before retiring from the music industry; he died in 2019.
