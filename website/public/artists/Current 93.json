  "name": "Current 93",
  "description": "'''Current 93''' are an English [[experimental music]] group, founded in 1982 by [[David Tibet]]. Much of Current 93's early work was similar to late 1970s and early 1980s [[industrial music]]: abrasive [[tape loop]]s, droning synthesizer noises and Tibet's distorted, excoriating vocals. In the mid-'80s, Current 93's sound shifted to a style Tibet has called \"apocalyptic folk\", combining [[folk music]] with industrial elements. Tibet has been the only constant member of Current 93, with a wide variety of collaborators joining in over the years. They have released over twenty full-length albums, as well as many other recordings.",
