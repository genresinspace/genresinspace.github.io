  "name": "Big Joe Williams",
  "description": "'''Joseph Lee Williams''' (October 16, 1903 – December 17, 1982) was an American [[Delta blues]] guitarist, singer, and songwriter, notable for the distinctive sound of his [[nine-string guitar]]. Performing over five decades, he recorded the songs \"[[Baby, Please Don't Go]]\", \"[[Crawlin' King Snake]]\", and \"Peach Orchard Mama\", among many others, for various record labels. He was inducted into the [[Blues Hall of Fame]] on October 4, 1992.\n\nThe blues historian Barry Lee Pearson (''Sounds Good to Me: The Bluesman's Story'', ''Virginia Piedmont Blues'') described Williams's performance:\n:When I saw him playing at [[Mike Bloomfield]]'s \"blues night\" at the Fickle Pickle, Williams was playing an electric nine-string guitar through a small ramshackle amp with a pie plate nailed to it and a beer can dangling against that. When he played, everything rattled but Big Joe himself. The total effect of this incredible apparatus produced the most buzzing, sizzling, African-sounding music I have ever heard.<ref name=\"typepad1\"/>",
