  "description": "'''Salvador \"Sal\" Cuevas''' (June 16, 1955 – April 9, 2017) was an American [[salsa music|salsa]] bassist known for his association with the [[Fania All-Stars]] from 1978 to 1985. \n\nAlthough he played the [[upright bass]], he was one of the most popular [[electric bass]]ists in the New York salsa scene, often playing in a [[funk]] style. \"He was the first to bring the slaps and funk style that he learned from [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], Funk, and [[Jazz]] music, into Salsa music.\" According to [[Billy Idol]], Sal Cuevas came up with the bass for “[[Eyes Without a Face (song)|Eyes Without a Face]]” when Billy was looking for a sound that was powerful enough to compliment the dark unromantic lyrics.",
