  "description": "'''Bambata''' is a music project in [[South Africa]] which has produced three popular albums, ''[[1906 (Bambata album)|1906]]'' in 2000, ''[[ukhandampondo (poll tax)]]'' in 2002, and ''[[Abashokobezi 1906–2006]]'' in 2006.\n\nThe main forces in this project are Sipho Sithole, director and founder of the Native Rhythms Productions, Philangezwi Bongani Nkwanyana, Mathufela Zuma and Bheki Khoza. They chose the name '''Bambata''' for their project in order to honour [[Bhambatha|Bambatha kaMancinza (ca. 1860–1906?)]], a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] chief of the amaZondi tribe in the [[Colony of Natal]] (modern [[Kwazulu-Natal]]), who had a large role in a [[Bambatha Rebellion|rebellion against the English in 1906]] when the poll tax was raised from a tax per hut to per head (£1 tax on all native men older than 18).\n\nThe basic idea behind the Bambata project is to fuse Zulu traditional rhythms, amahubo (folk music) and [[maskanda]] guitar with African and [[mainstream jazz]] along with elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rap]], [[reggae]] and [[kwaito]]. For the first two albums Bambata was not a band, but for each album and for many of the individual songs, artists were chosen that could interpret the songs with their individual talents. The third album was more of a group effort, with Philangezwi Bongani Nkwanyana, Mathufela Zuma and Faca forming the core of the group.\n\nThe beginnings of the Bambata go back to 1994, when Sithole and Bongani Nkwanyana met at the Windybrow Arts Festival. Sithole recognised in Bongani Nkwanyana an untapped talent, but the latter did not agree to the project until 1998, when Sithole brought along his cousin, the Maskandi singer and guitarist Mathufela Zuma.\n\nThe themes in Bambata songs range from suffering under colonialism and imperialism to social issues such as crime and incarceration.",
