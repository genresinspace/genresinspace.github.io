  "description": "'''The Deviants''' (formerly '''The Social Deviants''') were a British [[psychedelic rock]] band originally active from late 1966 to 1969. The bandname was later used as a vehicle for the musical work of writer [[Mick Farren]] until his death in 2013.\n\nFarren has stated that The Deviants were originally a community band which \"did things every now and thenâ€”it was a total assault thing with a great deal of inter-relation and interdependence\". Musically, Mick Farren described that they were influenced by [[The Who]], Charles Mingus, Velvet Underground, and [[Frank Zappa]].",
