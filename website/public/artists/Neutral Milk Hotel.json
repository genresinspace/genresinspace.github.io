  "name": "Neutral Milk Hotel",
  "description": "'''Neutral Milk Hotel''' was an American band formed by [[Jeff Mangum]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana]], in 1989. They were active until 1998, and then from 2013 to 2015. The band's music featured a deliberately [[lo-fi music|low-quality]] sound, influenced by [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic folk]]. Mangum wrote surreal and opaque lyrics that covered a wide range of topics, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. He and the other band members played a variety of instruments, including non-traditional instruments like the [[singing saw]] and [[uilleann pipes]].\n\nNeutral Milk Hotel began as one of Mangum's [[home recording]] projects. After graduating high school, Mangum lived as a vagabond and sporadically released music. In 1996, he worked with childhood friend [[Robert Schneider]] to record the album ''[[On Avery Island]]'', which received modest reviews and sold around 5,000 copies. Mangum recruited musicians [[Julian Koster]], [[Jeremy Barnes (musician)|Jeremy Barnes]], and [[Scott Spillane]] for the band's second album, ''[[In the Aeroplane Over the Sea]]''. Its 1998 release received mostly positive, but not laudatory reviews.\n\nWhile on tour, the band's popularity grew through Internet exposure. This negatively affected Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate; he did not want to continue touring and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. During their hiatus, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a [[cult following]] and the critical standing of ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' rose tremendously. Several music outlets such as ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' called ''In the Aeroplane Over the Sea'' a landmark album for indie rock and one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. Many indie rock groups such as [[Arcade Fire]] and [[the Decemberists]] were influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel's eclectic music and earnest lyrics. Neutral Milk Hotel reunited in 2013 and undertook a reunion tour before another hiatus in 2015.",
