The band had three top-ten and another five top-40 singles on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the 1990s, as well as number-one dance tracks in the UK and US. They were notable for pioneering use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]] technology, in particular, their practice of manipulating samples from mainstream pop, rock, R&B and soul songs and combining them with contrasting dance beats, using the samples in a new context.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} The band wrote, produced and mixed all of their own music.\nThe duo were joined on stage by additional musicians when they played live from 1991 to 2001.
