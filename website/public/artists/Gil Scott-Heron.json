  "description": "'''Gilbert Scott-Heron''' (April 1, 1949 â€“ May 27, 2011) was an American [[Jazz poetry|jazz poet]], singer, musician, and author known for his work as a [[spoken-word]] performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician [[Brian Jackson (musician)|Brian Jackson]] fused [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[soul music|soul]] with lyrics relative to social and political issues of the time, delivered in both [[rapping]] and [[melisma]]tic vocal styles. He referred to himself as a \"bluesologist\", his own term for \"a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues\". His poem \"[[The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]\", delivered over a [[soul jazz|jazz-soul]] beat, is considered a major influence on [[hip hop music]].\n\nScott-Heron's music, particularly on the albums ''[[Pieces of a Man]]'' and ''[[Winter in America]]'' during the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later [[African-American music]] genres, including [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[neo soul]]. His recording work received much critical acclaim, especially for \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\". [[AllMusic]]'s John Bush called him \"one of the most important progenitors of [[rap music]]\", stating that \"his aggressive, no-nonsense street poetry inspired a legion of intelligent rappers while his engaging songwriting skills placed him square in the R&B charts later in his career.\"\n\nScott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, titled ''[[I'm New Here]]''. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, [[iarchive:lastholidaymemoi0000scot|The Last Holiday]], was published posthumously in January 2012. Scott-Heron received a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2012. He also is included in the exhibits at the [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] (NMAAHC) that officially opened on September 24, 2016, on the [[National Mall]], and in an NMAAHC publication, ''Dream a World Anew''. In 2021, Scott-Heron was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as a recipient of the Early Influence Award.",
