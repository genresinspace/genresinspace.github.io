For 51 years, it consisted of vocalist-guitarist [[Billy Gibbons]], drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]], and bassist-vocalist [[Dusty Hill]] until his death in 2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' [[blues]] style and Hill and Beard's [[rhythm section]]. They are known for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats, and long beards.\n\nZZ Top formed after Gibbons' band, [[Moving Sidewalks]], disbanded in 1969. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' in 1971. Albums ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and ''[[Fandango!]]'' (1975), and singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio [[airplay]]. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for their live act, including the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] (1976–77), which was a critical and commercial success. ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album ''[[El Loco]]'' (1981), they began to experiment with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. They established a more mainstream sound and rose to international stardom with ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]]. The popularity of the albums' music videos, including for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", gave them mass exposure on [[MTV]] and made them prominent in 1980s [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. The Afterburner tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing of 1986.\n\nAfter the release of their 10th album, ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990), and its [[Recycler Tour|accompanying tour]], the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003). They released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin' 50'' (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. In 2018 the band won the [[Guinness world record]] for the longest-running active group with no lineup changes. On July 28 2021, ZZ Top announced that Hill had died at his home in Houston at the age of 72. In line with Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime [[guitar tech]], Elwood Francis.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million records. They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, the members were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Gibbons the 32nd-greatest guitarist of all time. The band members have supported campaigns and charities including [[Childline]], [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]], and the [[Delta Blues Museum]].",
