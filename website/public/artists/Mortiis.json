  "name": "Mortiis",
  "description": "'''Mortiis''' is an [[Electronic music|electronic]] band from [[Notodden]], Norway fronted by '''Håvard Ellefsen''', who is also known as the namesake of the band. The name is a misspelling of the word \"mortis\", which is the pronunciation used by the band. Mortiis started as the solo project of Ellefsen as a means to convey a story. This aspect was lost over time and Mortiis slowly formed into a band. Ellefsen previously played bass in the [[black metal]] band [[Emperor (Norwegian band)|Emperor]] (1991–1992), prior to forming this project in 1993. The time he spent in his previous band laid the groundworks for mixing black metal elements with various electronic genres, with these being touched upon across each \"era\" of the band.",
