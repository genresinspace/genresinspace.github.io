  "description": "'''The Offspring''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Garden Grove, California]], in 1984. Originally formed under the name '''Manic Subsidal''', the band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist [[Dexter Holland|Bryan \"Dexter\" Holland]], lead guitarist [[Noodles (guitarist)|Kevin \"Noodles\" Wasserman]], bassist [[Todd Morse]], multi-instrumentalist Jonah Nimoy, and drummer [[Brandon Pertzborn]]. The Offspring is often credited (alongside fellow [[Punk rock in California|California punk]] bands [[Green Day]], [[NOFX]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]]) for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock during the mid-1990s. During their {{age|1984|6|1}}-year career, the Offspring has released eleven studio albums and sold more than 45 million records, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands.\n\nThe Offspring's longest-serving drummer was [[Ron Welty]], who replaced original drummer [[James Lilja]] in 1987. He was replaced by [[Atom Willard|Adam \"Atom\" Willard]] in 2003, who was replaced four years later by [[Pete Parada]]. Parada parted ways with the band in 2021 after he refused to be [[COVID-19 vaccine|vaccinated against COVID-19]], and was replaced two years later by Pertzborn. [[Greg K.|Greg \"K.\" Kriesel]] (one of the Offspring's co-founders) was the band's bassist until he was fired in 2018; this left Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse, who had been the Offspring's touring guitarist since 2009. Morse's position as touring musician was filled by Nimoy, who later became an official member in 2023.\n\nAfter achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 [[The Offspring (album)|self-titled debut album]] and the seven-inch EP ''[[Baghdad (EP)|Baghdad]]'' (1991), the Offspring signed with independent label [[Epitaph Records]] and released two albums: ''[[Ignition (The Offspring album)|Ignition]]'' (1992) and ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' (1994). ''Smash'', which contained the band's first major hit \"[[Come Out and Play (The Offspring song)|Come Out and Play]]\", is one of the best-selling albums released on an [[independent record label]], selling over 11 million copies worldwide and helping to propel punk rock into the mainstream. The success of ''Smash'' attracted attention from major labels including [[Columbia Records]], with whom the Offspring signed in 1996; their first album for the label, ''[[Ixnay on the Hombre]]'' (1997), did not match its predecessor's success, but received favorable reviews and [[Recording Industry Association of America|gold and platinum]] RIAA certifications. The band reached further success with its fifth album ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]'' (1998), from which three of the singles − \"[[Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)]]\", \"[[Why Don't You Get a Job?]]\" and \"[[The Kids Aren't Alright]]\" − became [[Contemporary hit radio|mainstream radio]] and [[MTV]] staples, while the album went on to sell over five million units in the US and achieved the Offspring's highest chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number two. Though their next two albums, ''[[Conspiracy of One]]'' (2000) and ''[[Splinter (The Offspring album)|Splinter]]'' (2003), were not as successful as those from the previous decade, they were both critically acclaimed, with the former going platinum and the latter being certified gold. The Offspring's eighth studio album, ''[[Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace]]'' (2008), cemented their comeback on the strength of its second single \"[[You're Gonna Go Far, Kid]]\", which topped the [[Alternative Airplay|''Billboard'' rock charts]] for eleven weeks and has since obtained platinum status. The band released no new studio albums between ''[[Days Go By (The Offspring album)|Days Go By]]'' (2012) and ''[[Let the Bad Times Roll]]'' (2021), but continued touring and released a series of one-off songs in the interim. Their latest studio album, ''[[Supercharged (The Offspring album)|Supercharged]]'', was released on October 11, 2024.",
