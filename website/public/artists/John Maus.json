  "name": "John Maus",
  "description": "'''John Maus''' (born February 23, 1980) is an American musician, composer, singer, and songwriter known for his [[baritone]] singing style and his use of vintage [[synthesizer]] sounds and [[Medieval music|Medieval]] [[church mode]]s, a combination that often draws comparisons to 1980s [[goth-pop]]. His early [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] recordings anticipated and inspired the late 2000s [[hypnagogic pop]] movement. On stage, he is characterized for his intense displays of emotion while performing. He is also a former teacher of philosophy at the [[University of Hawaii]], where he later earned his [[PhD]] in [[political science]].\n\nMaus' early influences included [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[a-ha]], [[Syd Barrett]], [[Jim Morrison]], and composers of the  [[medieval music|Medieval]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] eras. In 1998, he left his hometown of [[Austin, Minnesota|Austin]], Minnesota to study [[experimental music]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. When he befriended and first worked alongside classmate [[Ariel Pink]], he took a greater interest in [[pop music]]. He produced most of the music from his first two albums ''[[Songs (John Maus album)|Songs]]'' (2006) and ''[[Love Is Real]]'' (2007) on cassette tape with an early 1990s sound bank. The albums generally drew negative reviews upon release, and it was not until the success of his third, ''[[We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves]]'' (2011), that he became more widely accepted as an [[outsider music|outsider]] artist. Following a five-year absence from public appearances and releasing new music, he returned with the albums ''[[Screen Memories (album)|Screen Memories]]'' in 2017, and ''[[Addendum (album)|Addendum]]'' in 2018. He will release his sixth studio album ''Later Than You Think'' in September 2025.\n\nWritings about Maus frequently link his music to his academic vocations, although Maus himself denies composing with an aesthetic or political theory in mind. He says that on some of his songs, his intention is to investigate \"forgotten\" electronic palettes, harmonies that were historically associated with \"the divine\", and lyrics that follow certain social idioms to their \"absurd conclusions\". His [[dissertation]], \"Communication and Control\" (2014), discusses the influence of technology on [[social control]].",
