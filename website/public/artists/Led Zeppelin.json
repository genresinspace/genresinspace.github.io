  "description": "'''Led Zeppelin''' were  an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised vocalist [[Robert Plant]], guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], bassist-keyboardist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and drummer [[John Bonham]]. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including [[blues]] and [[folk music]], Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Among the [[list of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]], they influenced the music industry, particularly in the development of [[album-oriented rock]] and [[stadium rock]].\n\nLed Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, [[the Yardbirds]], and were originally named \"the New Yardbirds\". They signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]] that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved all-but-unmatched commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, ''[[Led Zeppelin (album)|Led Zeppelin]]'', was a top-ten album in several countries and features such tracks as \"[[Good Times Bad Times]]\", \"[[Dazed and Confused (Jake Holmes song)|Dazed and Confused]]\" and \"[[Communication Breakdown]]\". ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' (1969), their first number-one album, includes \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[Ramble On]]\". In 1970, they released ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' which opens with \"[[Immigrant Song]]\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' (1971), is one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] in history, with 37 million copies sold. It includes \"[[Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)|Black Dog]]\", \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" and \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock. ''[[Houses of the Holy]]'' (1973) includes \"[[The Song Remains the Same (song)|The Song Remains the Same]]\" and \"[[The Rain Song]]\". ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' (1975), a double album, features \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\" and \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\".\n\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band's final album. The latter half of their career saw a series of [[Led Zeppelin concerts|record-breaking tours]] that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' (1976) and ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' (1979), declined in the late 1970s. After Bonham's death in 1980, the group disbanded. The three surviving members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 [[Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert]] in London, with Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham]] on drums.\n\nLed Zeppelin have sold an estimated 200 to 300&nbsp;million records worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with five of their albums certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|Diamond]] in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\", \"the biggest band of the seventies\", and \"unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history\". They were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995; the museum's biography states that they were \"as influential\" in the 1970s as [[the Beatles]] were in the 1960s.",
