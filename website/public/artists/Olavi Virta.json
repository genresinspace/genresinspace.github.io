  "name": "Olavi Virta",
  "description": "'''Olavi Virta''' (originally until 1926 '''Oskari Olavi Ilmén'''; 27 February 1915 – 14 July 1972) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] singer, acclaimed during his time as the \"King\" of [[Finnish tango]]. \n\nBetween 1939 and 1966 he recorded almost 600 songs, many of which are classics of Finnish popular music, and appeared in many films and theatrical productions. Of his most acclaimed [[Tango music|tangos]] are ''Punatukkaiselle tytölleni'' (\"For My Red Haired Girl\"), ''Ennen kuolemaa'' (\"Before Death\"; [[French language|French]]: ''Avant de Mourir'') and ''Täysikuu'' (\"Full Moon\"), while standouts from his other popular songs are ''Poika varjoisalta kujalta'' (\"Boy From a Shady Alley\"; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''[[Guaglione]]''), ''Hopeinen kuu'' (\"Silver Moon\"; Italian: ''Guarda Che Luna''), ''Eva'' and ''Kultainen nuoruus'' (\"The Golden Youth\").'''' He was also the second tenor of the quartet [[Kipparikvartetti]] in the early 1950s.\n\nHe was born in [[Sysmä]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. At the beginning of his career he received three [[Music recording sales certification|gold records]] for the songs ''Ennen kuolemaa'', ''[[Kiss of Fire|Tulisuudelma]]'' (El Choclo) and ''[[La Cumparsita]]''. Virta also acted in sixteen different [[Finnish films]], including ones of the then-popular [[Pekka Puupää]] series. When he began his career in 1939, he was marketed as the \"[[Bing Crosby]] of [[Finland]].\" He has also been compared to the American singer-actor [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\nVirta was very much popular in the 1950s in Finland. However, around 1959 is when his life began to turn in another direction. His wife Irene, whom he had three children with, left him and moved to [[Sweden]] in that year, and he began having health issues from an ever augmenting problem with [[alcoholism]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and a [[stroke]]. His career was cut short one night when he was arrested for drunken driving in [[Ilomantsi]] in 1962, after which the press mockingly called him \"The Singing Meatball.\" Ten years later he succumbed to alcoholism, living his final years in poverty. He died in [[Pispala]], [[Tampere]], and was buried in the [[Malmi Cemetery]].\n\nHis influence in [[Music of Finland|contemporary Finnish music]] has not been forgotten, and today a number of Finnish [[Schlager music|Schlager singers]] cite him as a particular role model or influence when it comes to the realm of music. At least one movie, debuting in October 2018 and simply called, \"Olavi Virta\" has been produced about his life, as well as one documentary by Finnish film director and historian, [[Peter von Bagh]]. He was one of the ten people to be chosen by the upcoming [[Finnish Music Hall of Fame]] museum due to be opened in [[Helsinki]].",
