  "description": "'''Genocide Organ''' is a German [[Power electronics (music)|power electronics]]/[[martial industrial]] collective, formed in [[Mannheim|Mannheim, Germany]] in 1985. They are known for their brutal and controversial presentation in their music and attitude.\n\nMany of the themes present in their music make reference to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and war. This insistence on these themes has led to accusations of being [[far-right extremists]], they have denied these accusations in interviews saying: ''“''We never say what we think, and we never believe what we say, and if we tell the truth by accident, we hide it under so many lies that it is difficult to find out''”.'' Due to this attitude, the website [[Discogs]] has blocked the sale of a number of their albums.",
