  "description": "'''Boyz II Men''' ({{IPAc-en|'|b|ɔɪ|z|.|t|u|.|m|ɛ|n}} {{respell|boyz-too-men}}) is an American [[vocal harmony]] group from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], best known for emotional [[ballad]]s and [[a cappella]] harmonies. Formed in 1985, they have been a trio composed of baritone [[Nathan Morris]], tenor [[Wanya Morris|Wanyá Morris]],  and [[Shawn Stockman]] since 2003. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men was a quartet with bass singer [[Michael McCary]], who left the group in 2003 due to health issues after being diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].\n\nThe group first saw commercial success in 1991 with the release of their singles \"[[Motownphilly]]\" and \"[[It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday#Boyz II Men version|It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday]],\" both of which peaked within the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Their 1992 single, \"[[End of the Road (Boyz II Men song)|End of the Road]]\" peaked atop the chart and set a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|then-record]] for spending 13 weeks at the position. Boyz II Men later broke this record twice more with the singles \"[[I'll Make Love to You]]\" and \"[[One Sweet Day]]\" (with [[Mariah Carey]]) which, at 14 and 16 weeks respectively, set records for most weeks at number one. When \"[[On Bended Knee]]\" took the number one spot away from \"[[I'll Make Love to You]],\" Boyz II Men became the third musical act, after [[the Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]], to replace themselves atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. These achievements gave Boyz II Men recognition as ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's biggest [[boy band]] from 1987 to 2012.\n\nBoyz II Men continued to perform as a trio despite McCary's departure. Their latest studio album, ''[[Under the Streetlight]]'', was released in 2017. Boyz II Men have received four [[Grammy Awards]]. They also became the first group contestants to win ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' where they competed as \"Buffalos\" in [[The Masked Singer (American TV series) season 12|season twelve]].",
