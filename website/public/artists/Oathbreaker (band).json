  "name": "Oathbreaker",
  "description": "'''Oathbreaker''' is a Belgian band from [[Flanders]], formed in 2008 and currently signed to [[Deathwish Inc.]] The band consists of guitarists Lennart Bossu and Gilles Demolder, drummer Wim Coppers, and vocalist Caro Tanghe who performs both [[Screaming (music)|screamed]] and sung vocals. They are a part of [[Church of Ra]], an artistic collective started by [[Amenra]], a band of which Lennart and Caro are also members. Like Amenra, Oathbreaker emerged from the Belgian underground [[hardcore punk]] scene but integrated [[extreme metal]] and [[art music]] aesthetics.\n\nThey have released three studio albums: ''Mælstrøm'' (2011), ''[[Eros/Anteros|<nowiki>Eros|Anteros</nowiki>]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rheia (album)|Rheia]]'' (2016). The last two were generally well reviewed, on account of dark atmospheres, extremely intense sound, poetic lyrics, and raw emotion.",
