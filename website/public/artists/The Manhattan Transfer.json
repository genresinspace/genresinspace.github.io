  "name": "The Manhattan Transfer",
  "description": "'''The Manhattan Transfer''' was an American vocal group founded in 1969 in [[New York City]], performing music genres like [[a cappella]], Brazilian [[jazz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[vocalese]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], and standards. They won eleven [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]].\n\nThere were several incarnations and formations of the Manhattan Transfer, with each edition having different styles. \n\nThe first rendition was in the 1960s, consisting of a mostly a cappella-tinged style; it featured [[Tim Hauser]], Erin Dickins, Marty Nelson, Pat Rosalia, and Gene Pistilli. The second version of the group, formed in 1972, incorporating a more vocal jazz approach, consisted of Hauser, [[Alan Paul]], [[Janis Siegel]], and [[Laurel Massé]].\n\nThe third, and most commercially perceived, formation of the group happened in 1979, because Massé had to leave the group after being badly injured in a car crash and was replaced by [[Cheryl Bentyne]]. This edition of the Manhattan Transfer performed electronic-styled pop, soul, funk, and rhythmic music, having success in the 1980s.\n\nThe group's fourth edition, since the 1990s, originally consisted of Hauser, Paul, Siegel, and Bentyne, and performed mostly [[Cool jazz|cool]] and [[smooth jazz]]. It also had several rotating touring members, and longtime pianist [[Yaron Gershovsky]] accompanied the group on tour and served as [[music director]]. Trist Curless from the Los Angeles a cappella group [[m-pact]] became a permanent member in October 2014 following Hauser's death. The group officially retired in 2023.",
