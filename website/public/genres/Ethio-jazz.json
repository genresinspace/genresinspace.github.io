  "description": "'''Ethiopian jazz''', also referred to as '''Ethio-jazz''', is a blend of [[Ethiopian music|traditional Ethiopian music]] with [[jazz]], combining the [[pentatonic scale]]-based melodies of [[Amharic]] music with the [[12-tone scale]] and instrumentation of western music. Over time the genre has gained popularity outside Ethiopia and grown to include elements from other genres such as [[afrofunk]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Latin music|Latin]] rhythms. The genre originated in the 1950s with Armenian refugees such as musician [[Nerses Nalbandian]], who created a fusion of Ethiopian and Western music while working at the [[Ethiopian National Theatre|National Theatre]]. Ethiopian jazz was revolutionized by [[Mulatu Astatke]] in the late 1950s. Mulatu is considered the father of Ethio-jazz music.",
