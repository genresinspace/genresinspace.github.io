  "description": "'''Cold wave''' is a loosely defined music genre that emerged in Europe the late 1970s, characterized by its detached lyrical tone, use of early [[electronic music]] instruments and a [[minimal music|minimalist]] approach and style. It emerged from [[post-punk]] bands who, influenced by German electronic group [[Kraftwerk]], made use of affordable portable [[synthesizer]]s such as the [[Korg MS-20]]."
