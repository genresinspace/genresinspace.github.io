  "description": "'''Freak folk''' is a loosely defined subgenre of psychedelic folk that involves acoustic sounds, pastoral lyrics, and a neo-[[hippie]] aesthetic. The label originated from the \"lost treasure\" reissue culture of the late 1990s.\n\n[[Vashti Bunyan]] has been labeled \"the Godmother of Freak Folk\" for her role in inspiring the new crop of folk experimentalists. [[David Crosby]]'s 1971 album ''[[If Only I Could Remember My Name]]'' has been described as an early progenitor of the genre. Other major influences on later freak folk artists include [[Linda Perhacs]], [[Anne Briggs]], [[Karen Dalton]], [[Shirley & Dolly Collins]], [[Animal Collective]], [[the Incredible String Band]], [[Xiu Xiu]], and [[Pearls Before Swine (band)|Pearls Before Swine]]. [[Devendra Banhart]] would become one of the leaders of the 2000s freak-folk movement, along with [[Joanna Newsom]].",
