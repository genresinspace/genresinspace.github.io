  "description": "'''Extreme metal''' is a loosely-defined [[umbrella term]] for a number of related [[heavy metal music]] subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal, and visual [[wikt:transgression|transgression]]\", and refers to metal that is harsher, heavier, more aggressive and less commercialized than [[Heavy metal genres|other subgenres]]. It is generally [[underground music]]. The term usually includes [[thrash metal]], [[death metal]], [[black metal]] and [[doom metal]]. Some definitions do not recognise doom metal, or consider that only some subgenres of it are extreme. Most extreme metal styles have very fast tempos and originally took inspiration from [[hardcore punk]]. The exception is doom metal, which instead is often extreme in terms of its heaviness and slowness.",
