It has been defined as a \"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal, and visual [[wikt:transgression|transgression]]\", and refers to metal that is harsher, heavier, more aggressive and less commercialized than [[Heavy metal genres|other subgenres]]. Extreme metal is generally [[underground music]] that values [[Heavy metal subculture#Authenticity|authenticity]] and strives to remain outside the mainstream. The term usually includes [[thrash metal]], [[death metal]], [[black metal]] and [[doom metal]]. Some definitions do not recognise doom metal, or consider that only some of its subgenres are extreme.
