  "description": "'''Manele''' (from [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''fem.'' ''sg.'' '''manea'''; ''pl.'' '''manele''', the plural form being more common) is a genre of [[pop folk]] music from [[Romania]].\n\nThe manele can be divided into \"classical manele\" and \"modern manele\". The \"classical manele\" are a [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]]-derived genre performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] musicians called [[lăutari]] in a [[Lăutărească music|lăutărească manner]], while the \"modern manele\" are a mixture of [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]], [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] and [[Music of Serbia|Serbian]] elements, generally using modern (electronic) instruments and beats.\n\nSimilar music styles are also present in other [[Balkans|Balkan]] areas, such as [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[Bosnia]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] and with expatriates and emigrants originally from these regions. Related genres are Bulgarian ''[[Chalga]]'' (manele brought by Romanian visitors to Bulgaria is referred to as \"Romanian chalga\"), Greek modern ''[[Skiladiko]]'' and Serbian ''[[Turbo-folk]]'', each one being a mixture of local folk Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian influences over a [[Pop music|pop]] tune.",
