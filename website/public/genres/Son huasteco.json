  "description": "'''Son huasteco''' is one of eight Mexican song styles and is a traditional Mexican musical style originating in the six state area of Northeastern Mexico called [[La Huasteca]]. It dates back to the end of the 19th century and is influenced by Spanish and indigenous cultures. Usually it is played by a ''[[conjunto huasteco|Trio Huasteco]]'' composed of a guitarra quinta [[huapanguera]] (a five course, eight stringed guitar-like instrument) a [[Jarana huasteca]] (a stringed instrument related to the [[Jarana huasteca|jarana]]) and a violin. Singers will often use the [[falsetto]] register. The son huasteco is particularly noteworthy for its flamboyant and virtuoso violin parts, although the style varies from state to state. Footwork often danced to son huasteco is the [[Zapateado (Mexico)|Zapateado]]. Improvisation plays a strong role in the style, with musicians creating their own lyrics and arrangements to a standard repertoire. Typical ''sones huastecos'' are \"''[[Cielito Lindo]]''\", \"''La huazanga''\", \"''La sirena''\", \"''El querreque''\" and \"''La cigarra''\".\n\nRelated genres are [[Son Jarocho]] and [[Fandango]] espa√±ol.",
