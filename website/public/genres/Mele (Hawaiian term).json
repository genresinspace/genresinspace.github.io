  "description": "'''Mele''' are chants, songs, or poems. The term comes from the [[Hawaiian language]]. It is frequently used in song titles such as \"[[He Mele Lāhui Hawaiʻi]]\", composed in 1866 by [[Liliʻuokalani]] as a national anthem. Hawaiian songbooks often carry the word in the book's title. Mele is a [[cognate]] of [[Fijian language]] [[meke]].\n\nIn practical usage, the word can be combined with other words, such as Mele Hula, a metered chant. The word can either be a noun (He mele kēia), or used as a verb to mean \"to chant\" or \"to sing\" (E mele mai...).\n\nThe 1,255 recordings of Hawaiian chants and songs made by ethnomusicologist [[Helen Heffron Roberts]] 1923–1924 are cataloged at the [[Bishop Museum]] in [[Honolulu]] as individual meles. The museum database has a separate search category titled \"Mele Index\". The Kawaihuelani Center for Hawaiian Language at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]] teaches multiple classes on various aspects of mele.",
