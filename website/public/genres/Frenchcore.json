  "description": "'''Frenchcore''' is a subgenre of [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore techno]]. The style differs from other forms of hardcore in terms of a faster tempo, usually above 160 â€“185 BPM, and a loud and distorted offbeat bassline.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[drum machine]]s and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] were used to make this style. As technology developed, [[digital audio workstation|DAWs]] such as [[Ableton]] and [[Cubase]] became the standard for production. Modern frenchcore is often performed with live musical performers and sampling alongside a DJ set.",
