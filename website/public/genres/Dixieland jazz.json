  "description": "'''Dixieland jazz''', also referred to as '''traditional jazz''', '''hot jazz''', or simply '''Dixieland''', is a style of [[jazz]] based on the music that developed in [[New Orleans]] at the start of the 20th century. The 1917 recordings by the [[Original Dixieland Jass Band]] (which shortly thereafter changed the spelling of its name to \"Original Dixieland Jazz Band\") fostered awareness of this new style of music.",
