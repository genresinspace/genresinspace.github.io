  "description": "'''Horrorcore''' (also known as '''shock rap''', '''psycho rap''', '''horror hip hop''', '''horror rap''', '''death hip hop''', '''death rap''', or '''murder rap''') is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] based on [[horror fiction|horror]]-themed and often darkly [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] lyrical content and imagery. Its origins derived from certain [[hardcore hip hop]] and [[gangsta rap]] artists, such as the [[Geto Boys]], who began to incorporate [[supernatural]], the [[occult]], and [[psychological horror]] themes into their lyrics. Other early originators and influences on the genre include [[Gravediggaz]], [[Flatlinerz]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Brotha Lynch Hung]], [[Tech N9ne]],[[Necro (rapper)| Necro]], and [[Kool Keith]].\n\nUnlike most hardcore hip hop and gangster rap artists, horrorcore artists often push the violent content and imagery in their lyrics beyond the realm of realistic urban violence, to the point where the violent lyrics become gruesome, ghoulish, unsettling, or inspired by [[slasher film]]s or [[splatter film]]s. While exaggerated violence and the supernatural are common in horrorcore, the genre also frequently presents more realistic yet still disturbing portrayals of [[mental illness]] and [[drug abuse]]. Some horrorcore artists eschew supernatural themes or exaggerated violence in favor of more subtle and dark psychological horror imagery and lyrics.\n\nHorrorcore has incited controversy, with some members of the law enforcement community asserting that the genre incites crime. Fans and artists have been blamed for numerous high-profile instances of violent criminal activity, including the [[Columbine High School massacre]], the [[Farmville murders]], murders of law enforcement officers, and gang activity.",
