  "description": "'''Pinoy pop''' (also known as '''Philippine pop'''; an abbreviated form of \"'''Pinoy popular music'''\" or \"'''Philippine popular music'''\"; or '''P-Pop''') refers to [[popular music]] in the Philippines originating from the [[Original Pilipino music|OPM]] genre. With its beginnings in the late 1970s, Pinoy pop is a growing genre in the 2020s. Through the 1990s to the 2000s, Pinoy pop was regularly showcased in the live band scene.\n\nGroups such as [[Neocolours]], [[Side A (band)|Side A]], [[Introvoys]], [[The Teeth (Filipino band)|the Teeth]], [[Yano]], [[True Faith (band)|True Faith]], Passage and [[Freestyle (Philippine band)|Freestyle]] popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop of this era.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020, Philippine pop music or Pinoy pop went through a huge metamorphosis in its increased quality, budget, investment and variety, matching the country's rapid [[economy of the Philippines|economic growth]], and an accompanying social and cultural resurgence of its Asian identity. '''P-Pop''' emerged with a heavy influence from [[K-pop]] and [[J-pop]], a growth in Asian style ballads, idol groups, and EDM, and less reliance on Western genres, mirroring the [[Korean wave]] and similar Japanese wave popularity among [[Generation Z]] Filipinos and mainstream culture.",
