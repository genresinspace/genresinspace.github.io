  "description": "'''Post-rock''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[experimental rock]] that emphasizes [[Texture (music)|texture]], atmosphere, and non-traditional song structures over conventional rock techniques. Post-rock artists often combine rock instrumentation and rock stylings with [[Electronic musical instrument|electronics]] and digital production as a means of enabling the exploration of textures, timbres and different styles. Vocals, when present, are often used as an instrumental layer, with many bands opting for entirely instrumental compositions. The genre began in [[Indie music scene|indie]] and [[underground music]] scenes, but deviated.\n\nThe term ''post-rock'' was coined by music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], being popularized in a review of [[Bark Psychosis]]' 1994 album ''[[Hex (Bark Psychosis album)|Hex]]'', and he later expanded the concept as music \"using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes\". The term has since developed to refer to bands oriented around dramatic and suspense-driven [[instrumental rock]], making the term controversial among listeners and artists alike.\n\nGroups such as [[Talk Talk]] and [[Slint]] were credited with producing foundational works in the style in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the release of [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]]'s 1996 album ''[[Millions Now Living Will Never Die]]'', post-rock became an accepted term for the associated scene of artists. Over time, post-rock diversified, spawning fusion subgenres like [[post-metal]] and [[blackgaze]], and influencing indie rock, [[electronica]], and forms of metal.",
