The music originated from a combination of styles, including [[blues]] (both [[Twelve bar blues|12 bar]] and [[Jump blues|jump]]), [[Country music|country]], early [[R&B]], and a strong [[Gospel music|gospel]] influence that emanated from the sounds of Southern [[black church]]es. Bass guitar, drums, [[horn section]], organ, and gospel roots vocal are important to soul [[Groove (music)|groove]]. This rhythmic force made it a strong influence in the rise of [[funk]] music.
