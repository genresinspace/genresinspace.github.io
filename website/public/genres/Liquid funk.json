  "description": "'''Liquid funk''', '''liquid drum & bass''', '''liquid DnB''', '''melodic drum & bass''', or sometimes just '''liquid''' is a subgenre of [[drum and bass]]. While it uses similar [[bassline]]s and [[Bar (music)|bar]] layouts to other styles, it contains fewer bar-oriented samples and more instrumental layers (both [[synthesizer|synthesized]] and natural), harmonies, melodies and ambiance, producing a sentimental atmosphere directed at home listeners as well as [[nightclub]] and [[rave]] audiences. Music genres such as [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]] and sometimes [[blues]] have a pivotal influence on liquid funk.",
