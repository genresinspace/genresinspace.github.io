  "description": "The '''Greek punk''' ({{langx|el|Ελληνική πάνκ}}, {{IPA|el|eliniˈki ˈpank|pron}}) scene was small but powerful in the Greek capital, Athens, in the 1980s. Bands such as [[Adiexodo]] (''[[wiktionary:Dead end|Dead end]]''), [[Genia Tou Chaous]] (''Chaos generation''), [[Stress (greek band)|Stress]], [[Panx Romana]], [[Ex-humans]], [[Anti (punk band)|Anti]] (''[[wiktionary:Contra|Contra]]'') functioned as a bunch of related bands, who gave concerts together, in the same locations. Like elsewhere, punk attitude has been loosely used by various individuals, but most of the time the key element was the youthful anger and the provocative anti-establishment attitude.\n\nMany newer [[crust punk|crust]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] [[punk rock|punk]] bands such as [[Ksehasmeni Profitia]] ([[Greek language|Gr]]:ξεχασμένη προφητεία) (''Forgotten prophecy''), [[Naftia]] (''Nausea''), [[Deus Ex Machina (punk band)|Deus Ex Machina]] and others of the 1990s followed [[DIY ethic]]s, gradually forming a small but powerful network in most big Greek cities. This network has sometimes been linked with local [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-related groups, squats, cultural/social/left-wing centers. Most of the concerts of punk bands in Greece have no, or minimal, entrance fee and many of them are arranged according to [[DIY ethic]]s.\n\nContemporary punk bands have seldom managed to form a solid scene outside that DIY / anarchopunk movement, but sometimes a band might attract an enthusiastic core of dedicated fans, such as in the [[Oi!]] or [[streetpunk]] subgenres. Few attempts have been made to document information about Greek punk; one of those being a limited edition brochure of Anarchist Library (Anarhiki Vivliothiki). Some Greek webzines have also documented Greek punk history.",
