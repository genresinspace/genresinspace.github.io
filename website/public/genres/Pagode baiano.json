  "description": "'''Pagode baiano''' (also called '''pagodão''', '''swingueira''' and '''quebradeira''') is a Brazilian musical genre created in [[Salvador, Bahia]], originating from the mixture of [[Samba reggae|samba-reggae]] and [[pagode]], with the main difference being the inclusion of percussion, a faster rhythm and generally accompanied by choreography. Because it is a musical genre that emerged in [[Bahia]], it is wrongly confused with [[Axé|axé music]], mainly because both styles were fashionable in Brazil between the 1990s and 2000s.",
