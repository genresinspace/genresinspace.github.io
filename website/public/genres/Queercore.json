  "description": "'''Queercore''' (or '''homocore''') is a cultural/social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of the [[punk subculture]] and a music genre that comes from [[punk rock]]. It is distinguished by its discontent with society in general, and specifically society's disapproval of the [[LGBTQ community]]. Queercore expresses itself in a [[DIY ethic#Music|DIY]] style through magazines, music, writing and film.\n\nAs a [[music genre]], it may be distinguished by lyrics exploring themes of prejudice and dealing with issues such as [[sexual identity]], [[gender identity]] and the rights of the individual; more generally, queercore bands offer a critique of society endemic to their position within it, sometimes in a light-hearted way, sometimes seriously. Musically, many queercore bands originated in the [[punk rock|punk]] scene but the [[Industrial music|industrial music culture]] has been influential as well. Queercore groups encompass many genres such as [[hardcore punk]], [[electropunk]], [[indie rock]], [[power pop]], [[no wave]], [[noise music|noise]], [[Experimental music|experimental]], [[industrial music|industrial]] and others.",
