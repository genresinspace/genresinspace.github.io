Shashmaqam means the six [[Arabic maqam|Maqams]] (modes) in the [[Persian language|Persian]] language, [[dastgah]] being the name for Persian modes, and ''maqams'' being the name for [[musical modes|modes]] more generally.\n\nIt is a refined sort of music, with lyrics derived from [[Sufi]] poems about divine love. The instruments of shashmaqоm provide an austere accompaniment to the voices. They consist, at most concerts, of a pair of long-necked [[lute]]s ([[rawap]], [[Tar (string instrument)|tar]], [[Tanbur#Central_Asia|tanbur]] or [[dutar]]), the [[dayra]], or frame drum, which, with its jingles, is very much like a [[tambourine]], and the [[sato (instrument)|sato]], or bowed tanbur."
