  "description": "'''''Norteño''''' or '''''norteña''''' ({{IPA|es|noɾˈteɲo}}, ''northern''), also '''''música norteña''''', is a subgenre of [[regional Mexican]] music. The music is most often based on [[Duple and quadruple metre|duple]] and triple metre and its lyrics often deal with socially relevant topics, although there are also many norteño love songs. The [[accordion]] and the [[bajo sexto]] are traditional norteño's most characteristic instruments.\n\nThe genre is popular in both Mexico and the United States, especially among the Mexican and Mexican-American community, and it has become popular in other Spanish-speaking countries as far away as Chile. Though originating from rural areas, norteño is popular in both rural and urban areas.\n\nA '''''conjunto norteño''''' is a type of Mexican folk ensemble. It mostly includes [[diatonic accordion]], bajo sexto, [[electric bass]] or [[double bass]], [[drum]]s, and depending on the region, [[alto saxophone]].",
