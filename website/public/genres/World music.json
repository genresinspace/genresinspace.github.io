  "description": "\"'''World music'''\" is an English phrase for styles of music from non-English speaking countries, including quasi-traditional, [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]], and [[traditional music]].  World music's broad nature and elasticity as a musical category pose obstacles to a universal definition, but its ethic of interest in the culturally exotic is encapsulated in ''Roots'' magazine's description of the genre as \"local music from out there\".\n\nMusic that does not follow \"North American or British [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Folk music|folk]] traditions\" was given the term \"world music\" by music industries in Europe and North America. The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music. It has grown to include subgenres such as ethnic fusion ([[Clannad]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Enya]], etc.) and [[worldbeat]]."
