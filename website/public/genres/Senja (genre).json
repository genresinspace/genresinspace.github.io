  "description": "'''Senja songs''' (lit. Dusk songs) refers to a style of Indonesian [[independent music]] that is usually performed with minimalist [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] arrangements (often just acoustic guitar, string bass, or soft percussion) or simple ambient touches. The lyrics are known to be poetic and melancholic, bringing a sense of deep contemplation, yet still feeling soothing. Thematically, senja indie songs often talk about love, memories, nature (e.g. dusk, rain, coffee), and personal reflections with aesthetic and metaphorical language. This style of music is often referred to as Indonesian [[indie-folk]] or [[folk-pop]] due to being heavily influenced by [[ballad]]-style [[acoustic folk]]. It is popular among [[Millennials|millennial]] and [[Generation Z|Gen-Z]] Indonesians.",
