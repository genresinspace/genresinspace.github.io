  "description": "'''Klezmer''' ({{langx|yi|קלעזמער}} or {{lang|yi|כּלי־זמר}}) is an instrumental musical tradition of the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] of Central and Eastern Europe. The essential elements of the tradition include dance tunes, ritual melodies, and virtuosic improvisations played for listening; these would have been played at weddings and other social functions. The musical genre incorporated elements of many other musical genres including [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (especially [[Greek music|Greek]] and [[Romanian music|Romanian]]) music, [[Baroque music]], German and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] folk dances, and religious Jewish music. As the music arrived in the United States, it lost some of its traditional ritual elements and adopted elements of American [[big band]] and popular music. Among the European-born klezmers who popularized the genre in the United States in the 1910s and 1920s were [[Dave Tarras]] and [[Naftule Brandwein]]; they were followed by American-born musicians such as Max Epstein, [[Sidney Beckerman (musician)|Sid Beckerman]] and Ray Musiker.\n\nAfter the destruction of Jewish life in Eastern Europe during [[the Holocaust]], and a general fall in the popularity of klezmer music in the United States, the music began to be popularized again in the late 1970s in the so-called Klezmer Revival. During the 1980s and onwards, musicians experimented with traditional and experimental forms of the genre, releasing fusion albums combining the genre with [[jazz]], [[Punk music|punk]], and other styles.",
