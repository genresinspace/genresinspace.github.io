  "description": "'''Straight-ahead jazz''' is a genre of [[jazz]] that developed in the 1960s, with roots in the prior two decades. It omits the [[rock music]] and [[free jazz]] influences that began to appear in jazz during this period, instead preferring acoustic instruments, conventional piano comping, [[Bassline#Walking bass|walking bass]] patterns, and swing- and bop-based drum rhythms."
