  "description": "'''Urban/contemporary gospel''', also known as '''urban gospel music''', '''urban gospel pop''', or just simply '''urban gospel''', is a modern subgenre of [[gospel music]]. Although the style developed gradually, early forms are generally dated to the 1970s, and the genre was well established by the end of the 1980s. The [[radio format]] is pitched primarily to African-Americans. [[Christian hip hop]] can be considered a subtype of this genre."
