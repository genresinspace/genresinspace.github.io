  "description": "'''Trønder rock''' ({{langx|no|trønderrock}}) is a music and cultural scene developed in the [[Trøndelag]] region of [[Norway]] in the early 1970s, in which bands and artists merged [[folk rock]] inspired [[rock and roll]] with cultural characteristics.\n\nThe term was first coined by journalist {{ill|Bertil Lien|no}} in 1972, and has been described by Professor of Music Studies Ole Kai Ledang as \"rock music with trøndersk tone\" ({{langx|no|\"rockemusikk med trøndersk tonefall\"}}). However, the term also often includes bands that sing in English, especially {{ill|Prudence (band)|lt=Prudence|no|Prudence}}. In the book ''Trønderrock'' from 1982, authors Gunnar Sand and Nils Toldnes also emphasize the band Prudence and the solo career of the members [[Terje Tysland]] and [[Åge Aleksandersen]], but also [[Hans Rotmo]] and his band {{ill|Vømmøl Spellmannslag|no}}, {{ill|Arbeidslaget hass K. Vømmølbakken|no}} and {{ill|Heimevernslaget|no}}, which are more characterized by [[Norwegian folk music]].\n\nToday, the term has gained some further use, and is often used as a general term for artists and bands associated with Trøndelag.",
