  "description": "'''Soukous''' (from [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:secousse|secousse]]'', \"shock, jolt, jerk\") is a genre of [[dance music]] originating from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[French Congo]]). It derived from [[Congolese rumba]] in the 1960s, with faster dance rhythms and bright, intricate [[musical improvisation|guitar improvisation]], and gained popularity in the 1980s in [[France]]. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, song structures and longer dance sequences.\n\nSoukous fuses traditional [[Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese rhythms]] with contemporary instruments. It customarily incorporates [[electric guitar]]s, [[double bass]], [[conga]]s, clips, and [[Brass instrument|brass]]/[[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]. Soukous lyrics often explore themes of [[love]], [[social commentary]], [[Intimate relationship|amorous narratives]], philosophical musings, and ordinary [[Struggle session|struggles]] and [[success]]es. Singers occasionally sing and croon in [[Lingala]], [[Kikongo]], [[French language|French]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and bands often consist of a primary vocalist accompanied by several [[Backing vocalist|backing singers]].",
