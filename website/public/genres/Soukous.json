  "description": "'''Soukous''' (from [[French language|French]] ''[[wikt:secousse|secousse]]'', \"shock, jolt, jerk\") is a genre of [[dance music]] originating from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[French Congo]]). It derived from [[Congolese rumba]] in the 1960s, with faster dance rhythms and bright, intricate [[musical improvisation|guitar improvisation]], and gained popularity in the 1980s in [[France]]. Although often used by journalists as a synonym for Congolese rumba, both the music and dance associated with soukous differ from more traditional rumba, especially in its higher tempo, song structures and longer dance sequences.\n\nSoukous fuses traditional Congolese rhythms with contemporary instruments. It customarily incorporates [[electric guitar]]s, [[double bass]], [[conga]]s, clips, and [[Brass instrument|brass]]/[[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]]. Soukous lyrics often explore themes of [[love]], [[social commentary]], [[Intimate relationship|amorous narratives]], philosophical musings, and ordinary [[Struggle session|struggles]] and [[success]]es. Singers occasionally sing and croon in [[Lingala]], [[Kikongo]], [[French language|French]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and bands often consist of a primary vocalist accompanied by several [[Backing vocalist|backing singers]].",
