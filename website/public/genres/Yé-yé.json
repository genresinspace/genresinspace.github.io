The French term ''yé-yé'' was derived from the English \"yeah! yeah!\", popularized by British [[beat music]] bands such as [[the Beatles]]. The style expanded worldwide as the result of the success of figures such as French singer-songwriters [[Sylvie Vartan]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Françoise Hardy]].
