  "description": "'''New York soul''' refers to the [[soul music]] recorded and [[record producer|produced]] in [[New York City]]. New York soul was similar to similar in style to [[Memphis soul]] from the southern US, but it was more likely to have string arrangements (played by [[string section]]s) added to the recordings. Unlike most southern soul, New York soul was not typically recorded by \"house bands\". Instead, New York soul was usually recorded by [[session musician]]s who were hired for a single recording.\n\nSince the musicians were not a regular [[backup band]] that played together all the time, the playing was not as loose and spontaneous as a typical southern band's playing. Nevertheless, since the NYC session players were experienced musicians, they played with a professional style. Another difference between New York soul and southern soul was that New York soul was recorded in a city that boasted what in the 1960s were some of the most state of the art [[recording studio]]s, which were significantly more advanced than a typical southern studio. This gave a crisp sound to the recordings.",
