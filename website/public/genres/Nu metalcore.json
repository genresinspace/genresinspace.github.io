  "description": "'''Nu metalcore''' (or '''nu-core''') is a fusion genre that combines elements of [[nu metal]] and [[metalcore]]. The genre often makes use of a combination of [[Screaming (music)|screamed]] and sung vocals, in addition to [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdowns]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced drum beats and [[electronic music]] elements.\n\nDuring the 1990s, many nu metal groups took influence from the hardcore scene, and metalcore bands including [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] and [[Bury Your Dead]] embraced elements of nu metal at varying points in their careers. In the late 2000, some [[deathcore]] bands (a subgenre of metalcore) like [[Suicide Silence]], [[Emmure]] and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] began taking influence from nu metal as well. This led to the first wave of nu metalcore in the 2010s. In 2013, genre defining works such as [[Bring Me the Horizon]]'s ''[[Sempiternal (album)|Sempiternal]]'', [[My Ticket Home]]'s ''[[Strangers Only]]'' and [[Sworn In (band)|Sworn In]]'s ''[[the Death Card]]'' were released. By 2016, the formations of [[Cane Hill (band)|Cane Hill]], [[Ocean Grove (band)|Ocean Grove]] and [[Issues (band)|Issues]] had led to a solidified first wave. A second strain of the genre, originating from the hardcore scene, soon emerged with [[Code Orange (band)|Code Orange]]'s ''[[Forever (Code Orange album)|Forever]]'' (2017), [[Vein.fm]]'s ''[[Errorzone]]'' (2018) and [[Harm's Way (band)|Harm's Way]]'s ''[[Posthuman (Harm's Way album)|Posthuman]]'' (2018). In the 2020s, the genre continued to gain traction, with a new wave of groups including [[Loathe (band)|Loathe]], [[Tetrarch (band)|Tetrarch]] and [[Tallah]].",
