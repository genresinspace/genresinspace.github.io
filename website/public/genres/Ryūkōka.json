  "description": "{{nihongo|'''''Ryūkōka'''''|[[wikt:流行|流行]][[wikt:歌|歌]]||{{literal|popular song}}}} is a Japanese [[music genre|musical genre]]. The term originally denoted any kind of \"[[popular music]]\" in Japanese, and is the [[East Asian cultural sphere|sinic]] reading of ''hayariuta'', used for commercial music of [[Edo period|Edo Period]]. Therefore, ''imayō'', which was promoted by [[Emperor Go-Shirakawa]] in the [[Heian period]], was a kind of ''ryūkōka''. Today, however, ''ryūkōka'' refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of ''ryūkōka'' were developed from Western [[classical music]]. ''Ryūkōka'' ultimately split into two genres: ''[[enka]]'' and ''poppusu''. Unlike ''enka'', archetypal ''ryūkōka'' songs did not use the ''kobushi'' method of singing. ''Ryūkōka'' used [[legato]]. [[Bin Uehara]] and [[Yoshio Tabata]] are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of ''kobushi'' singing.\n\nMany composers and singers of ''ryūkōka'' went on to earn official distinctions; [[Ichiro Fujiyama]] and composers [[Masao Koga]] and [[Ryoichi Hattori]] received the [[People's Honour Award]] in later years.\n\nAlthough ''enka'' branched off from ''ryūkōka'', many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, [[Noriko Awaya]] said \"Whenever I hear ''enka'', I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting.\""
