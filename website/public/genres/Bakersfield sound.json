  "description": "The '''Bakersfield sound''' is a sub-[[musical genre|genre]] of [[country music]] developed in the mid-to-late 1950s in and around [[Bakersfield, California]]. Bakersfield is defined by its influences of [[rock and roll]] and [[honky-tonk]] style country, and its heavy use of electric instrumentation and [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeats]]. It was also a reaction against the slickly produced, orchestra-laden [[Nashville sound]], which was becoming popular in the late 1950s. The Bakersfield sound became one of the most popular and influential country genres of the 1960s, initiating a revival of honky-tonk music and influencing later [[country rock]] and [[outlaw country]] musicians, as well as [[progressive country]]. \n\n[[Wynn Stewart]] pioneered the Bakersfield sound, while performing artists [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]] became two of the most successful artists of the original Bakersfield era while performing with [[the Buckaroos]] and [[The Strangers (American band)|the Strangers]] respectively. Other major Bakersfield country artists include [[Jean Shepard]] and [[Susan Raye]].",
