  "description": "Cyber metal is a subgenre of industrial metal which incorporates numerous elements found predominantly in [[Electronic body music|EBM]] and [[aggrotech]], including the use of more melodic and less repetitive [[riff]]s, in opposition to mostly metallic and mechanical sound of [[industrial music]], first coined by [[Fear Factory]] in the mid-90s. [[The Kovenant]] was the first band to develop cyber metal with some of its more well-known aspects: harsh vocals, extreme guitar melodies, and symphonic keyboards. A wave of other bands described as cyber metal would follow, including [[Deathstars]], [[Mnemic]], [[Sybreed]], [[Turmion Kätilöt]], [[Illidiance]], [[Cypecore]], [[Mechina (band)|Mechina]], [[A Dark Halo]], and [[Neurotech]]."
