  "description": "'''Tahitian drumming''' is a style of drumming native to [[Tahiti]] and [[French Polynesia]]. Tahitian drumming and dance have become symbols of Polynesian [[heiva]] to the western world. Heiva is the Tahitian term for entertainment. This authentic performance symbolizes the past and present state of social hierarchies within the community and the island. There has been a significant amount of change to Tahitian drum dancing within the past fifty years. These changes have come from many different aspects of [[Polynesia]]n society. However, many of them stem from the broader outreach of this tradition to the rest of the world. This music has served as inspiration for many other styles across the globe, especially in other areas of the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]].",
