Western music celebrates the [[Western lifestyle|lifestyle]] of the [[cowboy]] on the open range, along the [[Rocky Mountains]], and among the [[prairies]] of Western North America. The genre grew from the mix of cultural influences in the [[American frontier]] and what became the [[Southwestern United States]] at the time, it came from the [[American folk music|folk music]] traditions of those living the region, those being the [[Appalachian folk music|hillbilly music]] from those that arrived from the [[Eastern United States|Eastern U.S.]], the [[corrido]] and [[ranchera]] from [[Northern Mexico]], and the [[New Mexico music|New Mexico]] and [[Tejano music|Tejano]] endemic to the Southwest. The music industry of the mid-20th century grouped the western genre with that of similar folk origins, instrumentation and rural themes, to create the banner of ''country and western music'', which was simplified in time to [[country music]].",
