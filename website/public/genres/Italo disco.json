  "description": "'''Italo disco''' (variously capitalized, and sometimes hyphenated as '''Italo-disco''') is a [[music genre]] which originated in Italy in the late 1970s and was mainly produced in the 1980s. Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign ([[hi-NRG]], [[Euro disco]]) and developed into a diverse genre. The genre employs [[electronic drum]]s, [[drum machine]]s, [[synthesizer]]s, and occasionally [[vocoder]]s. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish.\n\nThe origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the [[ZYX Music|ZYX]] record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s, then split into many genres ([[Eurobeat]], [[Italo house]], [[Italo dance]])."
