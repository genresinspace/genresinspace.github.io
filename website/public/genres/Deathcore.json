  "description": "'''Deathcore''' is an [[extreme metal]] subgenre that combines [[death metal]] with [[metalcore]]. The genre consists of death metal [[guitar riff]]s, [[blast beat]]s, and metalcore [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdowns]]. While there are some precursors to the concept of death metal fused with metalcore and hardcore elements seen in the 1990s, deathcore as a distinct genre emerged in the early 2000s and gained prominence beginning in the mid-2000s.\n\nSome of the genre's earliest examples include [[Antagony]], [[Despised Icon]], and [[the Red Chord]]. Deathcore's expansion in the mid-2000s saw bands like [[All Shall Perish]], [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Suicide Silence]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]], [[Job for a Cowboy]], [[Chelsea Grin]] and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] taking off. In the 2010s, deathcore bands began experimenting with an eclectic selection of other genres.\n\nThe genre has received criticism from longtime [[heavy metal subculture|fans of heavy metal music]], usually for its frequent use of breakdowns which are often associated with [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]. Some musicians classified as deathcore have rejected the label.",
