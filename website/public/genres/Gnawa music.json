  "description": "'''Gnawa music''' (Ar. {{lang|ar|ڭْناوة or كْناوة}}) is a body of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[Religious music|religious songs]] and rhythms. Emerging in the 16th and 17th centuries, Gnawa music developed through the cultural fusion of West Africans brought to Morocco, notably the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], and [[Bambara people|Bambara]] peoples, whose presence and heritage are reflected in the songs and rituals. Its well-preserved heritage combines ritual poetry with traditional music and dancing. The music is performed at ''lila'', communal nights of celebration dedicated to prayer and healing guided by the Gnawa ''maalem'', or master musician, and their group of musicians and dancers. Though many of the influences that formed this music can be traced to West African kingdoms, its traditional practice is concentrated in Morocco. Gnawa music has spread to many other countries in Africa and Europe, such as France.\n\nThe origins of Gnawa music are intricately associated with that of the famed royal \"[[Black Guard]]\" of Morocco.",
