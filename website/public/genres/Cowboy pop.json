  "description": "'''Cowboy pop''' is a term that American music journalist [[J. D. Considine]] first coined in his review of [[Rubber Rodeo]]'s 1984 album ''[[Scenic Views]]''. Although the term was coined in the 1980s, its usage since that time has been varied. In the late 2010s, the term began to be used to describe country-influenced indie rock and indie pop bands.",
