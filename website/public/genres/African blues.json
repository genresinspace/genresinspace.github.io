  "description": "'''African blues''' is a genre of [[popular music]], primarily from [[West Africa]]. The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional [[African music]] from its homeland to the [[United States]] and back. Some{{which|date=October 2015}} scholars and [[ethnomusicologist]]s have speculated that the [[Origins of the blues|origins of]] the [[Blues music|blues]] can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by [[African-American]]s during and after [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Even though the blues is a key component of [[American popular music]], its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous. One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation [[work songs]] with their [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] format, and more especially the relatively free-form [[field hollers]] of the later [[sharecropper]]s, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.\n\nAlbums such as ''[[African Blues (Ali Farka Touré album)|African Blues]]'' by Ali Farka Toure have a noticeable {{clarify span|text=African and American Blues influence. |explain=ambiguous |date=October 2015}} The death of [[Mali]]an guitar legend [[Ali Farka Touré]] has inspired a new round of speculation about the roots of the blues in Africa. Touré famously argued that the beloved American genre was \"nothing but African\", a bold assertion. The question has received extensive scholarly attention in [[Gerhard Kubik]]'s book ''Africa and the Blues'', and in [[Paul Oliver]]'s ''Savannah Syncopators: African Retentions in the Blues''.",
