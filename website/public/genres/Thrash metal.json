  "description": "'''Thrash metal''' (or simply '''thrash''') is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] characterized by its overall aggression and fast tempo. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar [[riffs]], overlaid with [[Shred guitar|shredding]]-style lead guitar work. \n\nThe genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of [[hardcore punk]] and the technicality of [[progressive rock]]. Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the [[conservatism]] of the [[Reagan era]] and the much more moderate, [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of [[glam metal]] which also developed concurrently in the 1980s.{{sfn|Weinstein|2000|p=48}} Derived genres include [[crossover thrash]], a fusion of thrash metal and hardcore punk.\n\nThe early thrash metal movement revolved around independent record labels, including [[Megaforce Records|Megaforce]], [[Metal Blade Records|Metal Blade]], [[Combat Records|Combat]], [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]], and [[Noise Records|Noise]], and the underground [[tape trading]] industry in both Europe and North America. The genre was commercially successful from approximately 1985 through 1991, bringing prominence to [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], all grouped together as the \"Big Four\" of U.S. thrash metal. Other bands, such as [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], [[Metal Church]], [[Nuclear Assault]], [[Flotsam and Jetsam (band)|Flotsam and Jetsam]], and [[Bay Area thrash metal|Bay Area]] acts [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Death Angel]], never achieved the same level of success as the \"Big Four\" but had also developed a strong following in the metal community, through [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]'' or otherwise. Some of the most popular international thrash metal bands from this era were Brazil's [[Sepultura]], Canada's [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], Switzerland's [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]], England's [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]], and the genre's German \"[[Teutonic thrash metal|Big Four]]\": [[Kreator]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]].\n\nThe thrash metal genre had declined in popularity by the mid-1990s, due to the commercial success of numerous genres such as [[alternative rock]], [[grunge]], and later [[pop-punk]] and [[nu metal]]. In response, some bands either disbanded or moved away from their thrash metal roots and more towards [[groove metal]] or [[alternative metal]]. The genre has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 2000s, with the arrival of various bands such as [[Bonded by Blood (band)|Bonded by Blood]], [[Evile]], [[Hatchet (band)|Hatchet]], [[Havok (band)|Havok]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]], and [[Warbringer]], who have all been credited for leading the so-called \"thrash metal revival\" scene.",
