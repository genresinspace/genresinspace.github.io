  "description": "'''Electronicore''' (also known as '''synthcore''' or '''trancecore''') is a fusion genre of [[metalcore]] music with elements of various [[electronic music]] genres, often including [[Trance music|trance]], [[electronica]], and [[dubstep]]. Electronicore emerged in the early 2000s. The British band [[Enter Shikari]], founded in 2003, is considered a pioneer. However, several online magazines attribute a pioneering role in this genre to the band [[I See Stars]], due to their debut album [[3-D (I See Stars album)|3-D]], which was very well-known within the scene.",
