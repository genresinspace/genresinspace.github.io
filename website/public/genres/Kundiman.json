  "description": "'''Kundiman''' is a genre of traditional [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[ballad]]s, predominantly with [[Love song|romantic]] themes. The [[lyrics]] of the kundiman are written in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. The [[melody]] is characterized by a smooth, flowing and gentle rhythm with dramatic intervals. Kundiman was the traditional means of [[serenade]] in the Philippines.\n\nThe kundiman emerged as an ''[[art song]]'' at the end of the 19th century and by the early 20th century, its musical structure was formalised by Filipino composers such as [[Francisco Santiago]] and [[Nicanor Abelardo]]; they sought poetry for their lyrics, blending verse and music in equal parts.",
