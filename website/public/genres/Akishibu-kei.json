  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''Akishibu-kei'''|アキシブ系|extra=[[Literal translation|lit.]] \"Akihabara-Shibuya style\"|lead=yes}} is a loosely defined trend from the 2000s that involved an increase of [[Shibuya-kei]] influence in [[anime]] soundtracks. The term is a portmanteau of \"Shibuya-kei\" and \"[[Akiba-kei]]\". Both were 1990s cultural movements associated with musical and [[otaku]] interests, respectively, and Akishibu-kei was thought to have represented a merging of the two.",
