The essence of mainstream hardcore sound is a [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[bass drum]] sound, overdriven to the point where it becomes clipped into a distorted [[Square wave (waveform)|square wave]] and makes a recognizably melodic tone.\n\nOften the Roland Alpha [[Roland Juno-106|Juno]] or the kick from a [[Roland TR-909]] was used to create this sound. Mainstream hardcore tracks typically include [[sampling (music)|samples]] and synthesized melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 165 to 180 [[Beats per minute|bpm]]. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in mainstream hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, [[pitch shift]]ed, or distorted."
