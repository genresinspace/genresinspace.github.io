Mainstream hardcore tracks typically include [[sampling (music)|samples]] and synthesized melodies with the typical tempo ranging from 165 to 180 [[Beats per minute|bpm]]. Violence, drugs and profanity are common themes in mainstream hardcore, perceptible through its samples and lyrics, often screamed, [[pitch shift]]ed, or distorted.",
