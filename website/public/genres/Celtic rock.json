  "description": "'''Celtic rock''' is a genre of [[folk rock]], as well as a form of [[Celtic fusion]] which incorporates [[Celtic music]], instrumentation and themes into a [[rock music]] context. It has been prolific since the early 1970s and can be seen as a key foundation of the development of successful mainstream Celtic bands and popular musical performers, as well as creating important derivatives through further fusions. It has played a major role in the maintenance and definition of regional and national identities and in fostering a [[pan-Celtic]] culture. It has also helped to communicate those cultures to external audiences.",
