  "description": "The '''emo revival''', or '''fourth wave emo''', was an underground [[emo]] movement which began in the late 2000s and flourished until the mid-to-late 2010s. The movement began towards the end of the 2000s [[Emo-pop|third-wave emo]], with [[Pennsylvania]]-based groups such as [[Tigers Jaw]], [[Algernon Cadwallader]] and [[Snowing (band)|Snowing]] eschewing that era's mainstream sensibilities in favor of influence from 1990s [[Midwest emo]] (i.e., second wave emo). Acts like [[Touché Amoré]], [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]] and [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]] drew from 1990s emo and especially its heavier counterparts, such as [[screamo]] and [[post-hardcore]].\n\nThe movement had become prominent in underground music by the mid-2010s, with influential releases from era-defining groups like [[Modern Baseball]], [[the Hotelier]] and [[Joyce Manor]]. It also expanded in scope and sonic diversity during this period. [[Soft grunge music|Soft grunge]] was pioneered by such groups as [[Title Fight]], [[Basement (band)|Basement]], [[Citizen (band)|Citizen]] and [[Turnover (band)|Turnover]], while [[State Faults]], [[Birds in Row]] and [[Portrayal of Guilt]] pushed the boundaries of screamo. Fourth-wave emo entered a decline toward the decade's end, as influential bands disbanded or entered periods of hiatus. A fifth-wave of bands began pushing the genre into more experimental territory, often embracing [[post-rock]]; examples include [[Pool Kids]], [[Glass Beach (band)|Glass Beach]] and [[Awakebutstillinbed]].",
