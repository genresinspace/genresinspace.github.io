  "description": "'''Cool jazz''' is a style and genre of modern [[jazz]] music inspired by [[bebop]] and [[big band]] that arose in the United States after [[World War II]]. It is characterized by relaxed [[tempo]]s and a lighter tone than that used in the fast and complex [[bebop]] style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of [[classical music]]. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that of contemporaneous jazz idioms. As [[Paul Tanner]], Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest, \"the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] colors, while the solos of [[Dizzy Gillespie|[Dizzy] Gillespie]] and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.\"\n\nThe term ''cool'' started being applied to this music around 1953, when [[Capitol Records]] released the album ''Classics in Jazz: Cool and Quiet''. Mark C. Gridley, writing in the ''[[All Music Guide to Jazz]]'', identifies four overlapping sub-categories of cool jazz:\n\n# \"Soft variants of bebop,\" including the [[Miles Davis]] recordings that constitute ''[[Birth of the Cool]]''; the complete works of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]; the output of [[Gerry Mulligan]], especially his work with [[Chet Baker]] and [[Bob Brookmeyer]]; the music of [[Stan Kenton]]'s sidemen during the late 1940s through the 1950s; and the works of [[George Shearing]] and [[Stan Getz]].\n# The output of modern players who eschewed bebop in favor of advanced [[Swing music|swing]]-era developments, including [[Lennie Tristano]], [[Lee Konitz]], and [[Warne Marsh]]; [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Paul Desmond]]; and performers such as [[Jimmy Giuffre]] and [[Dave Pell]] who were influenced by [[Count Basie]] and [[Lester Young]]'s small-group music.\n# Musicians from either of the previous categories who were active in California from the 1940s through the 1960s, developing what came to be known as [[West Coast jazz]].\n# \"Exploratory music with a subdued effect by [[Teddy Charles]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[John LaPorta]], and their colleagues during the 1950s.\"",
