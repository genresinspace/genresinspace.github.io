  "description": "A '''Nazi punk''' is a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] who is part of the [[punk subculture]]. The term also describes the related music genre, which is sometimes also referred to as '''hatecore'''. Nazi Punk music generally sounds like other forms of [[punk rock]], but differs by having lyrics that express hatred of some [[Minority groups|ethnic minorities]], [[Jews]], [[communists]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], and other perceived enemies.\n\nIt is a subgenre of punk that contrasts sharply with the [[anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] and frequently [[leftist]] ideas prevalent in much of the punk subculture.\n\nIn 1978 in Britain, the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front. Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it recruited several English punks, as well as forming a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds, and White Boss. In the early 1980s, the [[white power skinhead]] band Brutal Attack temporarily transformed into a Nazi punk band.\n\nThe Nazi Punk subculture appeared in the United States by the early 1980s around the [[hardcore punk]] scene.",
