Its rhythms can be traced back to West African [[Kaiso]] and the arrival of French [[Planter class|planters]] and their [[slaves]] from the [[French Antilles]] in the 18th century.\n\nIt is characterized by highly rhythmic and harmonic vocals, and was historically most often sung in a  [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] and led by a [[griot]]. As calypso developed, the role of the griot became known as a ''[[cariso|chantuelle]]'' and eventually, ''[[calypsonian]]''. As English replaced \"patois\" ([[Antillean]]) as the dominant language, calypso migrated into English, and in so doing it attracted more attention from the government. It allowed the masses to challenge the actions of the unelected Governor and Legislative Council, and the elected town councils of [[Port of Spain]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]. Calypso continued to play an important role in political expression.\n\nCalypso in the Caribbean includes a range of genres, including [[Benna (genre)|benna]] in [[music of Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua and Barbuda]]; [[mento]], a style of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[folk music]] that greatly influenced [[ska]], the precursor to [[rocksteady]], and reggae; [[spouge]], a style of Barbadian popular music; [[Dominica]] [[cadence-lypso]], which mixed calypso with the [[cadence rampa|cadence]] of [[Haiti]]; and [[soca music]], a style of [[kaiso]]/calypso, with influences from [[Chutney music|chutney]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], Latin and cadence-lypso."
