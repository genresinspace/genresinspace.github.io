  "description": "'''D-beat''' (also known as '''Discore''', '''kängpunk''', '''Discrust''', and '''crust-beat''') is a style of [[hardcore punk]], developed in the early 1980s by imitators of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], after whom the genre is named, as well as a [[drum beat]] characteristic of this subgenre. D-beat is known for its \"grinding, distorted and brutally political\" sound. Discharge may have themselves inherited the beat from [[Motörhead]] and the [[Buzzcocks]]. D-beat is closely associated with [[crust punk]], which is a heavier, more complex variation. The style was particularly popular in Sweden, and developed there by groups such as Crude SS, [[Anti Cimex]], [[Mob 47]], and [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]]. Other D-beat groups include [[Doom (UK band)|Doom]] and [[the Varukers]] from the UK; [[Disclose]] from Japan; [[Crucifix (band)|Crucifix]] and [[Final Conflict]] from the U.S.; [[Ratos de Porão]] from Brazil; and MG15 from Spain. While the style initially developed in the early 1980s, a number of new groups working within the subgenre emerged in the mid-1990s. These include the Swedish groups [[Wolfbrigade]], Totalitär, Avskum, [[Skitsystem]], and [[Disfear]].",
