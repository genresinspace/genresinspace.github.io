  "description": "'''Alternative rock''' (also known as '''alternative music''', '''alt-rock''' or simply '''alternative''') is a category of [[rock music]] that evolved from the [[independent music]] underground of the 1970s. Alternative rock acts achieved mainstream success in the 1990s with the likes of the [[grunge]] subgenre in the United States, and the [[Britpop]] and [[shoegaze]] subgenres in the United Kingdom and Ireland. During this period, many record labels were looking for \"alternatives\", as many [[Arena rock|corporate rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[glam metal]] acts from the 1980s were beginning to grow stale throughout the [[music industry]]. The emergence of [[Generation X]] as a [[Culture|cultural]] force in the 1990s also contributed greatly to the rise of alternative music.\n\n\"Alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or [[arena rock|commercial rock]] or pop. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, [[DIY ethic|DIY]] ethos of late-1970s [[punk rock]]. Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and [[zine]]s, [[college radio]] airplay, and [[word of mouth]] had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes), such as [[noise pop]], [[indie rock]], [[grunge]], and [[shoegaze]]. In September 1988, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and [[WFME-FM|WDRE-FM]] in New York, which were playing music from more [[Underground music|underground]], independent, and non-commercial rock artists.\n\nInitially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as [[R.E.M.]] and [[Jane's Addiction]], were signed to [[major labels]]. Most alternative bands at the time, like [[the Smiths]], one of the key British alternative rock bands during the 1980s, remained signed to [[independent label]]s and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the popularity of the grunge and [[Britpop]] movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream, and many alternative bands became successful.\n\nEmo found mainstream success in the 2000s with multi-platinum acts such as [[Fall Out Boy]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Paramore (band)|Paramore]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]]. Bands such as [[the White Stripes]] and [[the Strokes]] found commercial success in the early 2000s, influencing an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from [[garage rock]], [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], establishing a [[Post-punk revival|revival]] of the genres.",
