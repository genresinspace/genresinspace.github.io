  "description": "'''{{Lang|es|Nueva canción|italic=no}}''' (<small>European</small> {{IPA|es|ˈnweβa kanˈθjon|lang}}, {{IPA|es-419|ˈnweβa kanˈsjon|lang}}; 'new song') is a left-wing social movement and musical genre in [[Latin America]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], characterized by [[folk music|folk]]-inspired styles and socially committed lyrics. {{Lang|es|Nueva canción}} is widely recognized to have played a profound role in the pro-democracy social upheavals in Portugal, Spain and Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s, and was popular amongst socialist organizations in the region.\n\nSongs reflecting conflict have a long history in Spanish, and in Latin America were particularly associated with the \"''corrido''\" songs of Mexico's War of Independence after 1810, and the early 20th century years of Revolution. {{Lang|es|Nueva canción}} then surfaced almost simultaneously during the 1960s in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Spain]]. The musical style emerged shortly afterwards in other areas of Latin America where it came to be known under similar names.  {{Lang|es|Nueva canción}} renewed traditional Latin American folk music, and was soon associated with revolutionary movements, the Latin American [[New Left]], [[liberation theology]], [[hippie]] and [[human rights]] movements due to political lyrics. It would gain great popularity throughout Latin America, and left an imprint on several other genres like ''[[rock en español]]'', [[cumbia]] and [[Andean music]].\n\n{{Lang|es|Nueva canción}} musicians often faced censorship, exile, torture, death, or [[forced disappearance|forceful disappearances]] by the wave of right-wing [[military dictatorship]]s that [[Operation Condor|swept across Latin America]] and the Iberian peninsula in the [[Cold War]] era, e.g. in [[Francoist Spain]], [[Chile under Pinochet|Pinochet's Chile]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazar's Portugal]] and [[National Reorganization Process|Videla and Galtieri's Argentina]].\n\nDue to their strongly political messages, some {{Lang|es|nueva canción}} songs  have been used in later political campaigns, for example the [[Orange Revolution]], which used [[Violeta Parra]]'s \"''[[Gracias a la vida]]''\". {{Lang|es|Nueva canción}} has become part of Latin American and Iberian musical tradition, but is no longer a mainstream genre, and has given way to other genres, particularly ''rock en español''.",
