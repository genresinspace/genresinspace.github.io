  "description": "'''Kulintang''' ({{langx|id|kolintang}}, {{langx|ms|kulintangan}})\nis a modern term for an ancient instrumental form of music composed on a row of small, horizontally laid [[gong]]s that function melodically, accompanied by larger, suspended gongs and [[drum]]s. \n\nAs part of the larger [[gong-chime]] culture of [[Southeast Asia]], kulintang music ensembles have been playing for many centuries in regions of the [[Mindanao|Southern Philippines]], [[East Malaysia|Eastern Malaysia]], [[Regions of Indonesia#Eastern Indonesia|Eastern Indonesia]],  [[Brunei]] and [[Timor]], Kulintang evolved from a simple native signaling tradition, and developed into its present form with the incorporation of knobbed gongs from [[Sundanese people]] in [[Java Island]], [[Indonesia]]. Its importance stems from its association with the indigenous cultures that inhabited these islands prior to the influences of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] or [[Western world|the West]], making kulintang the most developed tradition of Southeast Asian archaic [[gong-chime]] ensembles.\n\nTechnically, ''kulintang'' is the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]], [[Lumad people|Lumad]] [[Ternate]], [[Moluccas]], and Timor term for the [[idiophone]] of metal gong kettles which are laid horizontally upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the ''kulintang'' is also called ''kolintang'' by the people of  [[Maranao]] and [[Sulawesi]], ''kulintango'' by [[Mongondow people|Mongondow]], ''[[Tifa totobuang|totobuang]]'' by those in central [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], ''kulintangan'' and ''gulintangan'' by those in [[Brunei]], [[Sabah]], [[North Kalimantan]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. Gulintangan or gulingtangan literally means rolling hands in [[Brunei]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sulu]].\n\nBy the twentieth century, the term ''kulintang'' had a  come to denote an entire Maguindanao ensemble of five or six instruments. Traditionally the Maguindanao term for the entire ensemble is ''basalen'' or ''palabunibunyan'', the latter term meaning “an ensemble of loud instruments” or “music-making” or in this case “music-making using a kulintang.”",
