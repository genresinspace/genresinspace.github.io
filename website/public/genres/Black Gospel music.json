  "description": "'''Black gospel music''', often called '''gospel music''' or '''gospel''', is the traditional music of the Black diaspora in the United States. It is rooted in the conversion of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] [[African Americans|Africans]] to Christianity, both during and after the [[Atlantic slave trade|trans-atlantic slave trade]], starting with [[work song]]s sung [[Field holler|in the fields]] and, later, with religious songs sung in various church settings, later classified as [[Spiritual (music)|Negro Spirituals]] (which shaped much of [[traditional black gospel|traditional Black gospel]]).\n\nBlack gospel music has been traditionally concerned with the African-American quest for freedom. It has provided both \"spiritual and communal uplift,\" first in the fields, and later in the [[Black church|Black Church]]; during the 1960s era in the South, it was described as the \"soundtrack of the struggle for [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]],\" helping create unity and faith for the work.\n\nThe modern iteration of the genre, [[urban contemporary gospel|contemporary gospel]], emerged in the late 1970s as a fusion of the traditional genre with the musical stylings of the era in secular Black music, which resulted in popularizing a whole new generation of artists and songs, expanding the larger genre's reach.\n\nAlso a popular form of [[Music industry|commercial music]], Black gospel was revolutionized in the 1930s by [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Thomas Dorsey]], the \"father of gospel music,\" who is credited with composing more than 1,000 gospel songs, including \"[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]\" and \"[[Peace in the Valley]].\" Dorsey also created the first gospel [[choir]] and sold millions of copies of his recordings nationwide.  The [[Pilgrim Baptist Church]] in [[Chicago]], Dorsey's home church, is currently in development as the [[National Museum of Gospel Music]].",
