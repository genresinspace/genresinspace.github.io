  "description": "'''Cajun music''' ({{langx|fr|Musique cadienne}}), an emblematic [[music of Louisiana]] played by the [[Cajuns]], is rooted in the [[ballads]] of the French-speaking [[Acadian]]s of [[Canada]]. Although they are two separate genres, Cajun music is often mentioned in tandem with the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]]-based [[zydeco]] music. Both are from southwest Louisiana and share French and African origins. These [[French Louisiana]] sounds have influenced [[American popular music]] for many decades, especially [[country music]], and have influenced [[popular culture|pop culture]] through [[mass media]], such as [[television commercials]].",
