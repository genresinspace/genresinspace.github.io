  "description": "'''Dancehall pop''' is a [[sub-genre]] of the [[Jamaica]]n genre [[dancehall]] that originated in the early 2000s. Developing from the sounds of [[reggae]], dancehall pop is characteristically different in its fusion with western [[pop music]] and digital music production. Dancehall pop is also different from dancehall in that most songs use lesser [[Jamaican Patois]] in lyrics––allowing it to be globally understood and consumed. It also incorporates the key pop music elements of having melodies, hooks, and the verse-chorus format. Additionally, the genre moves away from the [[reggae]] and [[roots reggae]] music origins in social and political protest, now lyrically centering on partying, dancing, and sexuality. By the early 2000s, dancehall pop had its entrance into the global music industry.",
