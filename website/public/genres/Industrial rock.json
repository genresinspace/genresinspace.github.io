  "description": "'''Industrial rock''' is a [[fusion genre]] that fuses [[industrial music]] and [[rock music]]. Originally emerging in the late 1970s, pioneered by artists such as [[Chrome (band)|Chrome]], [[Killing Joke]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]], and [[Skinny Puppy]], the movement was further proliferated in the late 1980s by [[Wax Trax! Records]] in [[Chicago]], with artists like [[Front 242]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Sister Machine Gun]].    \n\nSubsequently, the movement would lead to the emergence of genre fusions and subgenres like [[electro-industrial]], [[industrial metal]], [[martial industrial]],  [[industrial hip-hop]], [[industrial dance]] and [[industrial techno]]. By the 1990s, broader industrial music genres were made accessible to mainstream audiences through the popularity of acts such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Rammstein]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], all of whom released platinum-selling records.",
