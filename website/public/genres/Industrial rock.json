  "description": "'''Industrial rock''' is a [[fusion genre]] that fuses [[industrial music]] and [[rock music]]. It initially originated in the 1970s, and drew influence from early experimental and industrial acts such as [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Einst√ºrzende Neubauten]] and [[Chrome (band)|Chrome]]. Industrial rock became more prominent in the 1980s with the success of artists such as [[Killing Joke]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]], and partially [[Skinny Puppy]], and later spawned the offshoot genre known as [[industrial metal]]. The genre was made more accessible to mainstream audiences in the 1990s with the aid of acts such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], both of which have released platinum-selling records.",
