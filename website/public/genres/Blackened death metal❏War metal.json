  "description": "'''War metal''' (also known as '''war black metal''' or '''bestial black metal''') is a genre derived primarily from [[first-wave black metal]], while incorporating elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]. It is aggressive, cacophonous and chaotic and includes musical characteristics including tremolo picking, blast beats, [[Death growl|growled]] or [[Screaming (music)|screamed]] vocals and [[lo-fi]] production.\n\n[[Kansas City, Missouri]] band [[Order from Chaos]] and many of the acts on the record label Ross Bay Cult were also early proponents in the genre. The genre quickly developed a scene in Australia, with [[Sadistik Exekution]] and [[Bestial Warlust]]. It was the members of Bestial Warlust who coined the name \"war metal\". At this time, the Finnish scene was home to war metal bands [[Archgoat]] and [[Beherit]]. According to ''[[Invisible Oranges]]'', some see the genre as having begun with the 1996 formation of the Canadian band Conqueror, and as having concluded with the band's 1997 disbandment.\n\nOther notable acts in the genre include [[Revenge (Canadian band)|Revenge]], [[Diocletian (band)|Diocletian]], [[Teitanblood]], [[Black Witchery]], [[Axis of Advance]], [[Impiety (band)|Impiety]], [[In Battle]] and [[Zyklon-B (band)|Zyklon-B]]."
