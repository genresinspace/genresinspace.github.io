  "description": "'''Gospel blues''' (or '''holy blues''') is a form of blues-based [[gospel music]] that has been around since the inception of [[blues music]]. It combines [[evangelistic]] lyrics with [[blues]] instrumentation, often blues guitar accompaniment.\n\nAccording to musician and historian [[Stefan Grossman]], \"holy blues\" was coined to originally describe [[Reverend Gary Davis]]'s style of traditional blues playing with lyrics conveying a religious message. Davis and [[Blind Willie Johnson]] are considered the genre's two dominant performers, according to [[Dick Weissman]]. Other notable gospel-blues performers include [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] and [[Washington Phillips]].\n\nBlues musicians who became devout, or even practicing clergy, include [[Robert Wilkins|Reverend Robert Wilkins]] and [[Ishman Bracey]]. Bluesmen such as Blind Willie Johnson, [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Charley Patton]], [[Son House]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Skip James]] also recorded gospel blues or religious songs. Blind Lemon Jefferson and Charley Patton released gospel songs under a pseudonym.",
