  "description": "'''Afro''' is a genre of [[Music in Cuba|Cuban popular music]] with African themes which gained prominence during the [[afrocubanismo]] movement in the early 20th century. It originated in the late 19th century Cuban [[blackface]] theatre, where some elements from Afro-Cuban music traditions such as [[Santería]] and [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] were incorporated into a secular context. As a result, black themes were occasionally portrayed in a stereotypical and derogatory manner. Nonetheless, many afros accurately depicted the working-class life of black communities in Cuba.\n\nAfros are sung in a creolized form of Spanish, often similar to [[Bozal Spanish|bozal]]. In the 1940s and 1950s, the genre reached its peak of popularity often mixing with [[son cubano]] giving rise to the hybrid style known as '''afro-son''' (or son-afro). Compositions not based on the son structure were often labelled as ''canción afro'' (afro-song) or ''canción de cuna afro'' (afro-[[lullaby]]); the latter became a popular form, especially due to the popularity of Ernesto Grenet's \"''Drume negrita''\". Among the most notable singers of afro were [[Rita Montaner]], [[Bola de Nieve]], [[Desi Arnaz]] and [[Merceditas Valdés]].",
