  "description": "'''Political hip hop''' (also known as '''political rap''' and '''conscious hip-hop''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[Hip-hop|hip hop music]] that emerged in the 1980s as a form of political expression and [[activism]]. It typically addresses [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] issues through lyrics, aiming to inspire action, promote social change, or convey specific political viewpoints. The genre draws inspiration from earlier politically conscious artists, such as [[The Last Poets]] and [[Gil Scott-Heron]], as well as movements like the [[Black power movement|Black Power]] movement and the [[Black Panther Party]] from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nNotable early political hip hop artists include [[KRS-One]] and [[Boogie Down Productions]], as well as [[Public Enemy]], both of whom were influential in establishing political rap in the late 1980s with albums that addressed social and political concerns. Other artists, often labeled as part of the \"conscious rap\" movement, such as [[X Clan|X-Clan]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]], and [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy|Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]], followed in subsequent years, expanding the genre's focus on political messages.\n\nThe genre has long been intertwined with political activism, providing a platform for artists to address issues such as [[police brutality]], [[racism]], [[corruption]], and [[economic inequality]]. Some well-known examples of politically charged hip hop songs include: \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" (1982), \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\" (1989), \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" (1989), \"[[Changes (Tupac Shakur song)|Changes]]\" (1998), \"[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]\" (2004), \"[[Kingdom Come (Jay-Z album)|Minority Report]]\" (2006), \"[[The Blacker the Berry (song)|The Blacker the Berry]]\" (2015), \"[[Snow on tha Bluff (song)|Snow on Tha Bluff]]\" (2020), and \"[[The Bigger Picture (song)|The Bigger Picture]]\" (2020).",
