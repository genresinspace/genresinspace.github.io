  "description": "'''Canadian blues''' is the [[blues]] and blues-related music (e.g., [[blues rock]]) performed by blues bands and performers in [[Canada]]. Canadian blues artists include singers, players of the main blues instruments: guitar ([[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[electric guitar|electric]]), [[harmonica]] (\"blues harp\"), keyboards ([[piano]] and [[Hammond organ]]), bass and drums, [[songwriter]]s and [[music producer]]s. In many cases, blues artists take on multiple roles. For example, the Canadian blues artist [[Steve Marriner]] is a singer, harmonica player, guitarist, songwriter and record producer.\n\nDue to Canada's long shared border with the birthplace of the blues, the United States, there has always been collaboration and contact between Canadian blues artists and their US counterparts. Top Canadian blues artists perform at major US blues bars and festivals and travel to the US to play and record with influential US blues artists. Similarly, US blues bands routinely play in Canadian clubs and blues festivals, and perform and record with Canadian blues artists. For example, Canadian blues guitarist/singer [[JW-Jones]] has invited the US bluesman [[Kim Wilson]] (lead singer for [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]) to Canada to play with JW Jones' band and so that Wilson could record with Jones and act as [[record producer]] on one of Jones' mid-2000s albums.\n\nThere are hundreds of local and regionally based Canadian blues bands and performers which perform mainly in small venues in their home city or town. A much smaller number of Canadian bands and performers have achieved national or international prominence, due to the sales performance of their recordings, acclaim from blues [[music criticism|music reviewers]] and performances at major festivals in Canada, the US, and Europe. These notable bands and performers are supported by a broader Canadian \"blues scene\" that also includes city or regional blues societies, blues radio shows, blues festivals, blues clubs and informal blues \"[[jam session]]s\".",
