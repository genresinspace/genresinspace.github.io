  "description": "'''Emo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|oʊ}}) is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[rock music]] characterized by emotional, often [[Confessional poetry|confessional lyrics]]. It emerged as a style of [[hardcore punk]] and {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]]}} from the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} [[Washington, D.C., hardcore]] scene, where it was known as '''emotional hardcore''' or '''emocore'''. The bands [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]], among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[pop-punk]] bands, including [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]], [[Cap'n Jazz]], [[Mineral (band)|Mineral]], and [[Jimmy Eat World]]. By the {{nowrap|mid-1990s,}} [[Braid (band)|Braid]], [[the Promise Ring]], and [[the Get Up Kids]] emerged from [[Midwest emo]], and several [[independent record label]]s began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, [[screamo]], a more aggressive style of emo using [[screamed vocals]], also emerged, pioneered by the [[San Diego]] bands [[Heroin (band)|Heroin]] and [[Antioch Arrow]]. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Story of the Year]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[the Used]], and [[Underoath]].\n\nOften seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes [[Slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], black [[Eye liner|eyeliner]], tight {{nowrap|t-shirt}}s with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]]. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as \"emo kids\" or \"emos\". The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with [[social alienation]], sensitivity, [[misanthropy]], [[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]], and [[angst]]. Purported links to [[depression (mood)|depression]], {{nowrap|[[self-harm]]}}, and [[suicide]], combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against emo, with some bands, including [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]], rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it. There has long been controversy over which bands are labeled \"emo\", especially for bands that started outside traditional emo scenes; a viral website, [[Is This Band Emo?]], was created to address one fan's opinion on this question.\n\nEmo and its subgenre [[emo pop]] entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and [[Dashboard Confessional]], and many artists signed [[contract]]s with [[major record labels]]. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Fall Out Boy]], and [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some emo bands changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground [[emo revival]] emerged, with some bands, such as [[the World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die]] and [[Modern Baseball (band)|Modern Baseball]], drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called [[emo rap]] became mainstream; its most famous artists included [[Lil Peep]], [[XXXTentacion]], and [[Juice Wrld]].",
