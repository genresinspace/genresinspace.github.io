  "description": "'''Emo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|oʊ}} {{respell|EE|moh}}) is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[rock music]] that combines musical characteristics of [[hardcore punk]] with emotional, often [[Confessional poetry|confessional lyrics]]. It emerged as a style of hardcore punk and {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]]}} from the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} [[Washington, D.C., hardcore]] scene, where it was known as '''emotional hardcore''' or '''emocore'''. The bands [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]], among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[pop-punk]] bands, including [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]], [[Cap'n Jazz]], [[Mineral (band)|Mineral]], and [[Jimmy Eat World]]. By the {{nowrap|mid-1990s,}} [[Braid (band)|Braid]], [[the Promise Ring]], [[American Football (band)|American Football]], and [[the Get Up Kids]] emerged from [[Midwest emo]], and several [[independent record label]]s began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, [[screamo]], a more aggressive style of emo using [[screamed vocals]], also emerged, pioneered by the [[San Diego]] bands [[Heroin (band)|Heroin]] and [[Antioch Arrow]]. It's dervative form [[pop screamo]] achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Story of the Year]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[the Used]], and [[Underoath]].\n\nThe [[emo subculture]] signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes [[Slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], black [[Eye liner|eyeliner]], tight {{nowrap|t-shirt}}s with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]]. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as \"emo kids\" or \"emos\". The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with [[social alienation]], sensitivity, [[misanthropy]], [[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]], and [[angst]]. Purported links to [[depression (mood)|depression]], {{nowrap|[[self-harm]]}}, and [[suicide]], combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against emo, with some bands, including [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]], rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it. There has long been controversy over which bands are labeled \"emo\", especially for bands that started outside traditional emo scenes; a viral website, [[Is This Band Emo?]], was created to address one fan's opinion on this question. Emo and its subgenre [[emo pop]] entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and [[Dashboard Confessional]], and many artists signed [[contract]]s with [[major record labels]]. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Fall Out Boy]], and [[the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade.\n\nIn the late 2000s, an [[emo revival]] emerged, when groups including [[Tigers Jaw]], [[Algernon Cadwallader]] and [[TTNG]] drew on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo, rejecting the perceived commercial turn the genre had taken. This movement gained prominence in 2010s, with the success of [[Modern Baseball (band)|Modern Baseball]], [[Joyce Manor]] and [[the Hotelier]], and expanded outside of simply 1990s revivalism with the various sounds of [[Title Fight]], [[Basement (band)|Basement]], [[Citizen (band)|Citizen]], [[Touché Amoré]] and [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]]. At this same time, a fusion genre called [[emo rap]] became mainstream; its most famous artists included [[Lil Peep]], [[XXXTentacion]], and [[Juice Wrld]]. The emo revival movement ended in the late 2010s, giving way to the more experimental \"post-emo\" sounds of [[Origami Angel]], [[Awakebutstillinbed]] and [[Home Is Where]].",
