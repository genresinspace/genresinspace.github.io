  "description": "'''Grebo''' (or '''grebo rock''') was a short-lived [[subculture]] and broadly-defined subgenre of [[indie rock]] centred around the [[Midlands]], particularly [[Stourbridge]] and [[Leicester]]. Musically, the genre incorporated elements of [[electronic music|electronic]], [[punk rock]], [[folk music|folk]] and [[hip hop music]] into indie rock. The scene occupied the period in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United Kingdom before the popularisation of [[Britpop]] and [[grunge]]."
