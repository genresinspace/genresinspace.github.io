  "description": "'''Red dirt''' is a genre of [[country music]] that gets its name from the color of [[soil]] found in [[Oklahoma]]. Many red dirt acts got their start in bars surrounding [[Oklahoma State University]] in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]], a city considered to be the center of red dirt music. The genre also extends to music made south of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in Texas. [[Outlaw country]] legends [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]] have been associated with the distinctive [[Texas country music|Texas sound]], while the late Oklahoma singer-songwriter [[Bob Childers]] is widely recognized as the Father of Oklahoma red dirt music. At one time, the distinction between the two genres was sonically obvious; however, by 2008, that gap had diminished.",
