  "description": "'''UK drill''' is a subgenre of [[drill music]] and [[UK rap#Road rap|road rap]] that originated in the South London district of [[Brixton]] from 2012 onwards. While being sonically distinct from [[Chicago]] drill music, it embraces its aesthetic and melds it with [[UK rap#Road rap|road rap]], a British style of [[gangsta rap]] that became popular in the years prior to the existence of drill. UK drill lyrical content tends to be truculent, depicting the harsh realism of their lifestyles. The explicit lyricism has stimulated discussion about whether  or not the subgenre is a factor in an increase in knife crime in London. [[Gangs in the United Kingdom|Gang affiliation]] and [[Poverty in the United Kingdom|socioeconomically-deprived]] backgrounds are common amongst UK drill artists. Artists such as 150, [[67 (rap group)|67]], [[Harlem Spartans]], [[CGM (rap group)|1011]], and [[Skengdo x AM|410]] have been cited as innovators of UK drill.",
