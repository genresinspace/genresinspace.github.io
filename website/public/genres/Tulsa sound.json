  "description": "The '''Tulsa sound''' is a popular musical style that originated in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], during the second half of the twentieth century. It is a mix of [[blues]], [[blues rock]], [[Country music|country]], [[rock and roll]] and [[swamp pop]] sounds of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Artists considered to have pioneered the Tulsa sound include [[J. J. Cale]], [[Leon Russell]], Roger Tillison and [[Elvin Bishop]]. After 1980, [[Gus Hardin]] (country), and [[Jeff Carson]] (country) released roots music albums. Although [[Dwight Twilley]] is from Tulsa, his [[power pop]] style bears no resemblance to the Tulsa sound; likewise, [[David Gates]]' most recognized songs (including his work with [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) were mostly in the [[soft rock]] genre (though some of Gates' solo album cuts show a stronger Tulsa influence).",
