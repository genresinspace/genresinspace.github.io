  "description": "'''Disco''' is a [[music genre|genre]] of [[dance music]] and a [[subculture]] that emerged in the late 1960s from the United States' urban [[nightclub|nightlife]] scene, particularly in [[African Americans|African-American]], [[Italian-Americans|Italian-American]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] and [[queer]] communities. Its sound is typified by [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beats, [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[bassline]]s, [[string section]]s, [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[horn (musical instrument)|horns]], [[electric piano]]s, [[synthesizer]]s, and electric [[rhythm guitar]]s.\n\n[[Discoth√®ques]] as a venue were mostly a French invention, imported to the United States with the opening of [[Le Club]], a members-only restaurant and nightclub located at 416 East 55th Street in [[Manhattan]], by French expatriate [[Olivier Coquelin]], on New Year's Eve 1960.\n\nDisco music as a genre started as a mixture of music from venues popular among [[African-American culture|African Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Cultural matters|Latino Americans]], and [[Italian Americans#Influence on American culture and society|Italian Americans]] in [[New York City]] (especially [[Brooklyn]]) and [[Philadelphia]] during the late [[1960s in music|1960s]] to the mid-to-late 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] to both the dominance of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of '70s disco's popularity in the United States, including \"the [[Bump (dance)|Bump]]\", \"the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]\", \"the Watergate\", \"the Continental\", and \"the Busstop\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, disco music was developed further, mainly by artists from the United States as well as from [[Eurodisco|Europe]]. While performers garnered public attention, [[record producer]]s working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs such as [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]], a venue popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, consisting predominantly of loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. There was also a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]] in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[quaaludes]], the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]] as a reflection of the [[sexual revolution]] of this era in popular history. Films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) and ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\n\nDisco declined as a major trend in popular music in the United States following the infamous [[Disco Demolition Night]] on July 12, 1979, and it continued to sharply decline in popularity in the U.S. during the early [[1980s in music|1980s]]; however, it remained popular in [[Italo-disco|Italy]] and some European countries throughout the 1980s, and during this time also started becoming trendy in places elsewhere including [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], where aspects of disco were blended with regional folk styles such as ''[[ghazal]]s'' and [[Belly dance|belly dancing]]. Disco would eventually become a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]], [[house music]], [[hip-hop]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[dance-punk]], and [[post-disco]]. The style has had several revivals since the [[1990s in music|1990s]], and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. A revival has been underway since the early [[2010s in music|2010s]], coming to great popularity in the early [[2020s in music|2020s]]. Modern day artists have continued the genre's popularity, bringing it to a whole new younger generation.",
