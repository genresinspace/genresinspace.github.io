  "description": "'''Flamenco''' ({{IPA|es|flaˈmeŋko}}) is an art form based on the various folkloric music traditions of southern [[Spain]], developed within the [[Gitanos|gitano]] subculture of the region of [[Andalusia]], and also having historical presence in [[Extremadura]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]. In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of both contemporary and traditional musical styles typical of southern Spain. Flamenco is closely associated  to the gitanos of the [[Romani people|Romani]] [[ethnicity]] who have contributed significantly to its origination and [[professionalization]]. However, its style is uniquely Andalusian and flamenco artists have historically included Spaniards of both gitano and non-gitano heritage.\n\nThe oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' (The Moroccan Letters) by [[José Cadalso]]. The development of flamenco over the past two centuries is well documented: \"the theatre movement of [[sainete]]s (one-act plays) and [[tonadilla]]s, popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and ''toques'', perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings.&nbsp;... in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance.\"\n\nOn 16 November 2010, [[UNESCO]] declared flamenco one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].",
