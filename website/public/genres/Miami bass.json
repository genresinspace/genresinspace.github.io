  "description": "'''Miami bass''' (also known as '''booty music''' or '''booty bass''') is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The use of drums from the [[Roland TR-808]], sustained [[kick drum]], heavy bass, raised [[Electronic dance music|dance]] tempos, and frequently sexually explicit lyrical content differentiate it from other hip hop subgenres. Music author [[Richie Unterberger]] has characterized Miami bass as using rhythms with a \"stop-start flavor\" and \"hissy\" [[cymbal]]s with lyrics that \"reflected the language of the streets, particularly [[Miami]]'s historically black neighborhoods such as [[Liberty City (Miami)|Liberty City]], [[Goulds, Florida|Goulds]], and [[Overtown (Miami)|Overtown]]\".\n\nDespite Miami bass never having consistent mainstream acceptance, early national media attention in the 1980s resulted in a profound impact on the development of [[hip hop]], [[dance music]], and [[Pop music|pop]].",
