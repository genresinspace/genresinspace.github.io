  "description": "'''Crossover thrash''' (often abbreviated to '''crossover''') is a fusion genre of [[thrash metal]] and [[hardcore punk]]. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s, when hardcore punk bands, such as [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Cryptic Slaughter]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]] and [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]], began to incorporate the influence of thrash metal. At this time, the genre was particularly prominent in the [[New York hardcore]] scene, where groups including [[Agnostic Front]], [[Leeway (band)|Leeway]], [[Cro-Mags]] and [[Stormtroopers of Death]] were widely influential.\n\nThe genre largely declined in popularity by the 1990s; however, its influence developed the prominent [[metalcore]] genre. Since the 2000s, crossover thrash has experienced a number of underground revivals, which have produced notable acts including [[Municipal Waste (band)|Municipal Waste]], [[Trash Talk (band)|Trash Talk]], [[Power Trip (band)|Power Trip]], and [[Drain (punk band)|Drain]].",
