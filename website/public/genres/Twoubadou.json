  "description": "'''Twoubadou''' ({{IPA|ht|twubadu}}; {{langx|fr|Troubadour}}) music is a popular genre of guitar-based music from [[Haiti]] that has a long and important place in Haitian culture. The word comes from ''[[troubadour]]'', a medieval poet-musician who wrote and sang songs about [[courtly love]]. Like the troubadours of old, the Haitian twoubadou is a singer-composer who accompanies himself on songs that tell about the bitterness and humor of love, often using risqué or suggestive lyrics.",
