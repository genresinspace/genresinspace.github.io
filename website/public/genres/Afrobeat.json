  "description": "'''Afrobeat''' (also known as '''Afrofunk''') is a West African [[music genre]], fusing influences from Nigerian (such as [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]]) and Ghanaian (such as [[highlife]]) music, with American [[funk]], [[jazz]], and [[Soul music|soul]] influences. With a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion, the style was pioneered in the 1960s by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader [[Fela Kuti]], who popularised it both within and outside Nigeria. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most \"challenging and charismatic music performers.\"\n\nDistinct from Afrobeat is [[Afrobeats]], a combination of sounds originating in West Africa in the 21st century. This takes on diverse influences and is an eclectic combination of genres such as [[British hip hop|hip hop]], [[house music|house]], [[Jùjú music|jùjú]], [[ndombolo]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soca music|soca]], and [[dancehall]]. The two genres, though often conflated, are not the same.",
