  "description": "'''Latin Rock''' is a term to describe a subgenre blending traditional sounds and elements of Latin American and Hispanic Caribbean folk with [[rock music]]. However, it is widely used in the English-language media to refer any kind of rock music featuring Spanish or Portuguese vocals. This has led to controversy about the scope of the terminology.\n\nLatin Rock should not be confused with \"rock music from Latin America\" or [[Rock en Espa√±ol]]. It's also closely related to the [[Latin alternative]] scene (which combines Latin elements with [[alternative rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[electronic music]], [[Indie pop|indie]] or [[hip-hop]] among others) a term often used to refer the same phenomenon.",
