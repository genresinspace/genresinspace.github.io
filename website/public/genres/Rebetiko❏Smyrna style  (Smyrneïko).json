  "description": "During the early 20th century, the main centre of rebetiko music was the multi-national port of Smyrna (modern [[Ä°zmir]]) in [[Asia Minor]]. The musicians of Smyrna were influenced not only from the eastern sounds inside the [[Ottoman empire]], but also from the European-style music of the many European communities of the city, most notably the [[Italians]]. [[Smyrneiki Estudiantina]] was a group of musicians playing popular music for Greeks worldwide. After the [[Great fire of Smyrna]] many of them ([[Panagiotis Toundas]], [[Spyros Peristeris]], [[Giorgos Vidalis]], [[Anestis Delias]] and others) fled to Greece contributing to the development of the rebetiko style music in Greece.",
