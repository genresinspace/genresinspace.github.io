  "description": "{{nihongo|'''Nagoya kei'''|名古屋系||lit. \"Nagoya Style\"|lead=yes}} is a subgenre of the Japanese [[visual kei]] movement that developed in the early 1990s music scene of [[Nagoya]], Japan. Initially, the term simply referred to musical groups from Nagoya, but because many of these bands had a dark and decadent atmosphere, it came to be used to describe a unique aesthetic style specific to the city. Considered darker and gloomier than visual kei both musically and lyrically, Nagoya kei takes its influences more so from [[western world|western]] (specifically [[British people|British]]) [[punk rock]], [[gothic rock]] and [[alternative rock]] acts. The focus of the bands tends to be much less on [[costume]]s and [[makeup]] in favor of more complex musical compositions and concentration on the music itself. The term actually developed before visual kei was coined, and gradually died out as the latter gained more popularity.",
