  "description": "{{nihongo|'''Nagoya kei'''|名古屋系||lit. \"Nagoya Style\"|lead=yes}} is a subgenre of the Japanese [[visual kei]] movement that developed in the early 1990s music scene of [[Nagoya]], Japan. The term actually developed before visual kei was coined, and gradually died out as the latter gained more popularity. Often considered darker and gloomier than visual kei both musically and lyrically, Nagoya kei takes its influences more so from [[western world|western]] (specifically [[British people|British]]) [[punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] bands. The focus of the bands tends to be much less on [[costume]] and [[makeup]] in favor of more complex musical compositions and concentration on the music itself."
