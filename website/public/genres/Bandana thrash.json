  "description": "'''Bandana thrash''' is a movement within [[thrashcore]], that is sometimes associated with [[powerviolence]] that explored their debt to an earlier form of extreme [[punk rock]]. The term is in reference to the [[Kerchief|headgear preferred]] by many of the performers. The ideology of bandana thrash is [[DIY ethic]], in many cases [[straight edge]], street life, anticonsumerism, and worldwide unity, the latter is referred in many songs like \"Bandana United Us\" by GxHx, \"Intercontinental Bandana Union\", by [[What Happens Next? (band)|What Happens Next?]], as well in the manifesto in Conquest for Death's ''Many Nations, One Underground''\". The style was prominent into the early to mid 2000s."
