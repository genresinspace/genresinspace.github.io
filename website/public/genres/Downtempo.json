  "description": "'''Downtempo''' (or '''downbeat''') is a broad label for [[electronic music]] that features an atmospheric sound and slower beats than would typically be found in [[dance music]]. Closely related to [[ambient music]] but with greater emphasis on rhythm, the style may be played in relaxation clubs or as \"warm-up or cool-down\" music during a [[DJ set]]. Examples of downtempo subgenres include [[trip hop]], [[ambient house]], [[chillwave]], [[psybient]] and [[lo-fi hip hop|lofi hip hop]].\n\nThe style emerged in the late 1980s with the UK's [[Bristol sound|Bristol scene]] that birthed artists like [[Massive Attack]], [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]]. In the 1990s, the style was heard internationally in artists such as [[Hooverphonic]], [[Kruder & Dorfmeister]], [[Fila Brazillia]], and [[Thievery Corporation]]. Other prominent artists to emerge in the style include [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]], [[Boards of Canada]], [[Nicolas Jaar]], and [[Bonobo (musician)|Bonobo]].",
