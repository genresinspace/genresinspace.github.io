  "description": "'''Mbaqanga''' ({{IPA|zu|mɓaˈǃáːŋga}}) is a style of South African music that emerged in the early 1960s in the urban townships, particularly around Johannesburg. It draws from a variety of ethnic traditions, including Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Pedi, and Tsonga musical elements. Mbaqanga blends traditional South African vocal harmonies, rhythmic patterns, and dance styles with influences from [[marabi]], [[kwela]], and Western popular music such as [[jazz]]. It continues to influence musicians both in South Africa and globally.",
