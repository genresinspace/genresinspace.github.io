  "description": "'''Blog rock''' (also known as '''blog indie''') is a [[microgenre]] of [[indie rock]] that originally emerged in the early 2000s, which rose to prominence during the early online musical [[blogosphere]]. Similarly to other early [[blog]]-related music scenes such as [[bloghouse]] and [[blog rap]]. The term was used to describe bands who garnered attention primarily through music blogs and online spaces, independent of formal music industry structures.\n\nBlog rock refers less to a distinct musical style and more to the mode of distribution and discovery of an era where bands gained popularity primarily through the early stages of online music discussion on [[MP3 blog]]s and [[website]]s like [[Hype Machine]], [[Music for Robots (website)|Music for Robots]], [[Stereogum]] and [[Blogspot]]. Other online spaces included [[Internet forum]]s, [[Chat room|chatrooms]] as well as early [[social media]] platforms like [[Myspace]] and later [[Tumblr]].  The blog rock era took place primarily in the United States, with adjacent bands in the United Kingdom being labelled \"[[landfill indie]]\" by the British press. The era later became associated with the [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] subculture, with its visual style later becoming retroactively labelled \"[[indie sleaze]]\" in the early 2020s.\n\nNotable acts include [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]], [[Voxtrot]], [[Cold War Kids]], [[Cults (band)|Cults]], [[Tokyo Police Club]], [[Black Kids]], [[Black Moth Super Rainbow]], [[Cymbals Eat Guitars]], [[Sunset Rubdown]], [[Islands (band)|Islands]], [[Fang Island]], [[Anathallo]], [[Tapes 'n Tapes]], [[The Rural Alberta Advantage]], [[Menomena]], [[Ra Ra Riot]], [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]], [[The Dodos]], [[The Go!
