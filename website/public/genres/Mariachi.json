  "description": "'''Mariachi''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|m|ɑːr|i|ˈ|ɑː|tʃ|i}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|m|ær|-}}, {{IPA|es|maˈɾjatʃi|lang}}) is a genre of [[regional Mexican]] music dating back to at least the 18th century, evolving over time in the countryside of various regions of western [[Mexico]]. The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched [[Mexican vihuela|Mexican Vihuela]] and an acoustic bass guitar called a [[guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]], and all players take turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.\n\nDuring the 19th- and 20th-century migrations from rural areas into [[Guadalajara]], along with the Mexican government's promotion of national culture, mariachi came to be recognized as a distinctly Mexican [[son mexicano|''son'']]. Modifications of the music include influences from other music, such as [[polka]]s and [[waltz]]es, the addition of trumpets, and the use of [[charro outfit]]s by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. In 2011, [[UNESCO]] recognized mariachi as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]; it joins six other entries on the Mexican list.\n\nSong genres performed by mariachi ensembles include [[ranchera]]s, [[corrido]]s, [[cumbia]]s, [[Bolero#Cuba|boleros]], [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]], [[Son mexicano|sones]], [[huapango]]s, [[jarabe]]s, [[Danzón|danzones]], [[joropo]]s, [[pasodoble]]s, [[March (music)|marches]], [[polka]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[Schottis|chotís]]. Most song lyrics are about machismo, love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes, and country life."
