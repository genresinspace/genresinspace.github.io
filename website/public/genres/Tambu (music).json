  "description": "'''''Tambu''''' (also '''''tambú''''') is a drum, music genre and dance form, found on [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Curaçao]], and is a major part of the [[music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Antillean music]]. On Bonaire, it is also known as ''bari''. Curaçaoan tambu is a major part of that island's culture, and is there a genre that is considered ''muziek di zumbi'' (literally, ''spirit music'', referring to music of African origin), and is accompanied by instruments like the ''wiri'', ''agan'' and [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]. The word ''tambu'' derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for drum, ''tambor''.\n\nThe origins of Tambú can be traced back to the early 17th century, where a large number of African slaves arrived in Curaçao from Angola. The ritual was first associated with the Curaçao style of stick fighting called ''kokomakaku,'' where the Tambú referred to the rhythms played by the drummer (called a ''tamburero'') on a single drum (also referred to as ''tambú''). Since then, the performance has changed in congruence with the historical circumstances of the Curaçao island.\n\n''Tambu'' can refer to the small drum on which the music is played, the dance that accompanies the music, or the event where the music and dance take place. In modern ''tambu'', the lyrics are usually in the [[Papiamento|Papiamento language]] and are sung along with a ''chapi'' (hoe), the ''tambu'' drum and sometimes other singers, while the audience claps to the rhythm. The ''tambu'' rhythm is complicated and is passed down orally from generation to generation. ''Tambu'' consists of two beats; ''sla habri'' and ''sla será'', the open and closed beat respectively. These beats alternate to create a musical dialogue. The lead vocalists are known for their skilful wordplay when delivering the performance's message. Additionally, there are two types of ''tambu'' music; ''telele'', which is a long, slow rising and falling melody, and ''tambu'' itself, which is faster paced and shorter in duration.",
