  "description": "'''Complextro''' is typified by [[glitch (music)|glitchy]], intricate [[bassline]]s and textures created by sharply cutting between instruments in quick succession. The term, a [[portmanteau]] of the words \"complex\" and \"electro\", was coined by [[Porter Robinson]] to describe the music he was making in 2010. He has cited [[video game music|video game sounds]], or [[chiptune]]s, as an influence on his music along with 1980s [[analog synthesizer|analog synth]] music. Other producers of the genre include [[Adventure Club]], [[Kill the Noise]], [[Jon Gooch|Feed Me]], [[Knife Party]], [[The M Machine]], [[Madeon]], [[Mord Fustang]], [[Savant (musician)|Savant]], [[Virtual Riot]], [[Deadmau5]] and [[Wolfgang Gartner]].",
