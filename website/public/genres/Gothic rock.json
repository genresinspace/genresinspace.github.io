  "description": "'''Gothic rock''' (also known as '''goth rock''' or simply '''goth''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] which grew out of British [[post-punk]] in the late 1970s. The genre draws from [[gothic literature]], [[nihilism]], [[Dark Romanticism|dark romanticism]], [[poetry]] and [[tragedy]]. The style evolved through early post-punk bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Joy Division]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], and [[the Cure]], who shifted their music toward darker gothic overtones through an emphasis on minor chords, reverb, dark arrangements, and melancholic melodies. \n\nIn 1981, ''Sounds'' writer Steve Keaton published an article on \"punk gothique\", a term coined by [[UK Decay]] frontman [[Steve Abbott (musician)|Steve Abbott]] to describe their music. By 1983, the ''[[NME]]'' briefly used \"positive punk\" to describe a music scene associated with a London club known as the [[Batcave (club)|Batcave]], which included artists such as [[Alien Sex Fiend]], [[Specimen (band)|Specimen]], UK Decay, [[Sex Gang Children]], [[Rubella Ballet]] and [[Southern Death Cult]]. The British press later opted for the term \"goth\" to define the [[Goth subculture|subculture]] and style of music, which was further developed by the arrival of [[the Sisters of Mercy]]. Followed by, [[Flesh for Lulu]], [[Play Dead (band)|Play Dead]], [[Rubella Ballet]], [[Gene Loves Jezebel]], Blood and Roses, and [[Ausgang]].  \n\nIn the United States, [[45 Grave]] and [[Christian Death]] further developed the scene, which led to the emergence of [[deathrock]]. By the late 1980s and 1990s, gothic rock gave rise to several [[Fusion genre|fusion genres]] such as [[gothabilly]], [[gothic country]] and [[gothic metal]].",
