  "description": "'''Gothic rock''' (also called '''goth rock''' or simply '''goth''') is a style of [[rock music]] that emerged from [[post-punk]] in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The first post-punk bands which shifted toward dark music with gothic overtones include [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Joy Division]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], and [[the Cure]].\n\nThe genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk. Gothic rock stood out due to its darker sound, with the use of primarily minor or bass chords, reverb, dark arrangements, or dramatic and melancholic melodies, having inspirations in [[gothic literature]] allied with themes such as sadness, nihilism, dark romanticism, tragedy, melancholy and morbidity. These themes are often approached poetically. The sensibilities of the genre led the lyrics to represent the evil of the century and the romantic idealization of death and the supernatural imagination. Gothic rock then gave rise to a broader [[goth subculture]] that included clubs, [[Gothic fashion|fashion]] and publications in the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 21st century.",
