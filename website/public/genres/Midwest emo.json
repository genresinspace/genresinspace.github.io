  "description": "'''Midwest emo''' (or '''Midwestern emo''') is a subgenre and scene of [[emo]] music that emerged in the Midwestern United States during the 1990s. Employing unconventional vocal stylings, distinct guitar riffs and [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] melodies, Midwest emo bands shifted away from the genre's [[hardcore punk]] roots and drew on [[indie rock]] and [[math rock]] approaches. According to the author and critic [[Andy Greenwald]], \"this was the period when emo earned many, if not all, of the stereotypes that have lasted to this day: boy-driven, glasses-wearing, overly sensitive, overly brainy, chiming-guitar-driven college music.\" Midwest emo is sometimes used interchangeably with '''second-wave emo'''. While  Midwest emo was initially associated to be music by the region, its sound and aesthetic gradually spread beyond the region. The style was adopted by artists across the United&nbsp;States and internationally."
