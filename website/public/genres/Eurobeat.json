  "description": "'''Eurobeat''' refers to two styles of [[dance music]] that originated in [[Europe]]: one is a British variant of Italian [[Eurodisco]]-influenced [[dance-pop]], and the other is a [[hi-NRG]]-driven form of [[Italo disco]]. The former was developed in the 1980s, while the latter was developed starting from the early 1990s and continuing in the following decades, distancing itself from its [[Italo disco]] origins as time went on.\n\nProducer trio [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] and pop band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] made Eurobeat music more popular in the United States and Southeast Asia, where Eurobeat was historically marketed as [[hi-NRG]] (pronounced as \"high energy\"). For a short while, it also shared this term with Italo disco.",
