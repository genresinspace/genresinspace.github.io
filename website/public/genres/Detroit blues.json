  "description": "'''Detroit blues''' is [[blues]]  music played by musicians residing in and around [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], particularly in the 1940s and 1950s. Detroit blues originated when [[Delta blues]] performers migrated north from the [[Mississippi Delta]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to work in industrial plants in Detroit in the 1920s and 1930s. Typical Detroit blues is similar in style to [[Chicago blues]]. Its sound is distinguished from Delta blues by the use of electric amplified instruments and more varied instrumentation, including the [[bass guitar]] and [[piano]].\n\nThe only Detroit blues performer to achieve national fame was [[John Lee Hooker]], as record companies and promoters have tended to ignore the Detroit scene in favor of the larger, more influential Chicago blues. The Detroit scene was centered on the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.",
