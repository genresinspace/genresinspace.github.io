  "description": "'''Acid techno''', sometimes known generally as \"'''[[acid (electronic music)|acid]]'''\", is a genre of [[techno]] that was derived from [[acid house]] and developed in Europe in the late 1980s to early 1990s. It saw younger artists apply the \"squelching\" synthesizer sound of [[Chicago]] acid house to harder-edged techno material."
