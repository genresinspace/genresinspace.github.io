  "description": "'''Light music''' is a less-serious form of Western [[classical music]], which originated in the 18th and 19th centuries and continues today. Its heyday was in the mid‑20th century. The style is [[through-composed]], usually shorter orchestral pieces and suites designed to appeal to a wider context and audience than more sophisticated forms such as the [[concerto]], the [[symphony]] and the [[opera]].\n\nLight music was especially popular during the formative years of [[radio broadcasting]], with stations such as the [[BBC Light Programme]] (1945–1967) playing almost exclusively \"light\" compositions.\n\nOccasionally also known as '''mood music''' and '''concert music''', light music is often grouped with the [[easy listening]] genre. Light music was popular in the United Kingdom, the United States and in [[continental Europe]], and many compositions in the genre remain familiar through their use as themes in film, radio and television series.",
