  "description": "A '''bagad''' ({{IPA|br|ˈbɑːɡat|Breton:}}, {{IPA|fr|baɡad|lang}}) is a [[Music of Brittany|Breton]] band, composed of [[bagpipe]]s ({{langx|br|binioù}}, {{langx|fr|cornemuse}}), [[bombard (music)|bombards]] and [[drum]]s (including [[Snare drum|snare]], tenor and bass drums). The [[pipe band]] tradition in Brittany was inspired by the [[Pipe Band|Scottish]] example and has developed since the mid-20th century. A bagad plays mainly [[Music of Brittany|Breton music]], but a bagad's music is evolutionary: new forms and musical ideas are experimented with at each annual national competition.\n\nThe plural for ''bagad'' is unusual in that many are referred to as ''bagadoù'' but for two, three or any other specified number they are simply referred to as ''bagad'' (following the rules of Breton grammar).\n\nEvery major town and city in [[Brittany]] has at least one ''bagad'' and there are over eighty in total. There are also many ''bagadoù'' outside Brittany, owing to large-scale Breton emigration throughout France. [[Bagad Lann Bihoue]] is well known to belong to the [[French Navy]].\n\nFor competition purposes the ''bagadoù'' are ranked into five categories. Major competitions take place annually in [[Brest, France|Brest]] and in [[Lorient]], where the [[National Bagadoù Championship|National Championship]] takes place during the [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient|Interceltic Festival]] in August."
