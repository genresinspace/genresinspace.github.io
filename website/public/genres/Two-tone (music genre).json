  "description": "'''Two-tone''', or '''2 tone''', also known as '''ska-rock'''{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} and '''ska revival''', is a genre of British popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s that fused traditional [[Jamaica]]n [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], and [[reggae]] music with elements of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] music. Its name derives from [[2 Tone Records]], a record label founded in 1979 by [[Jerry Dammers]] of [[the Specials]], and references a desire to transcend and defuse racial tensions in [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher-era Britain]]: many two-tone groups, such as [[the Specials]], [[the Selecter]] and [[The Beat (British band)|the Beat]], featured a mix of [[black people|black]], [[white people|white]], and [[multiracial people]].\n\nOriginating in [[Coventry]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of [[England]] in the late 1970s, it was part of the second wave of ska music. It followed on from the first ska music that developed in Jamaica in the 1950s and 1960s, infused with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[new wave music|new wave]] textures.\n\nAlthough two-tone's mainstream commercial appeal was largely limited to the UK, it influenced the [[ska punk]] movement that developed in the US in the late 1980s and 1990s.",
