  "description": "'''Tumba francesa''' is a secular Afro-Cuban genre of [[dance]], [[song]], and drumming that emerged in [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], [[Cuba]]. It was introduced by slaves from the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (which would later become the nation of [[Haiti]]) whose owners resettled in Cuba's eastern regions following the [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] during the 1790s. The genre flourished in the late 19th century with the establishment of ''sociedades de tumba francesa'' (tumba francesa societies), of which only three survive.",
