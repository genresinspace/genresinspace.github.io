  "description": "'''Gothic metal''' (or '''goth metal''') is a fusion genre combining the aggression of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with the dark atmospheres of [[gothic rock]]. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in the [[United Kingdom]] originally as an outgrowth of [[death-doom]], a fusion of [[death metal]] and [[doom metal]]. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from [[gothic fiction]] as well as personal experiences.\n\nPioneers of gothic metal include [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[My Dying Bride]] and [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], all from the north of England. Other pioneers from the first half of the 1990s include [[Type O Negative]] from the United States, [[Lake of Tears]], [[Tiamat (band)|Tiamat]] and [[Katatonia]] from Sweden, and [[The Gathering (band)|the Gathering]] from the Netherlands. [[Norway|Norwegian]] band [[Theatre of Tragedy]] developed the \"beauty and the beast\" aesthetic of combining aggressive male vocals with clean female vocals, a contrast that had been adopted by groups before them, but not as a regular trademark; several bands have employed the technique since. During the mid-1990s, [[Moonspell]], [[Theatres des Vampires]], [[Rotting Christ]] and [[Cradle of Filth]] brought the gothic approach to [[black metal]]. By the end of the decade, a [[symphonic metal]] variant of gothic metal had been developed by  [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]] and [[Within Temptation]]. [[Nightwish]] also integrated elements of gothic metal into their well-known mix of symphonic metal and [[power metal]].\n\nIn the 2000s, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where groups such as [[Entwine]], [[Charon (band)|Charon]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Lullacry]], [[the 69 Eyes]], and [[Poisonblack]] have released hit singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as Type O Negative and [[Evanescence]] have found some degree of commercial success.",
