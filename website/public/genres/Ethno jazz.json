  "description": "'''Ethno jazz''', also known as '''world jazz''', is a [[Genre|subgenre]] of [[jazz]] and [[world music]], developed internationally in the 1950s and '60s and broadly characterized by a combination of traditional jazz and non-Western [[Elements of music|musical elements]]. Though occasionally equaled to or considered the successor of world music, an independent meaning of ethno jazz emerged around 1990 through the commercial success of ethnic music via [[globalization]], which especially observed a [[Western world|Western]] focus on Asian musical interpretations. The origin of ethno jazz has widely been credited to saxophonist [[John Coltrane]].\n\nNotable examples of ethno jazz include the emergence of jazz through [[New Orleans|New Orleanian]] and [[Cuba]]n exchange, [[Afro-Cuban jazz]] of the 1940s and '50s, and the [[Arab world|Arabic]] influence present in some American jazz from the 1950s and '60s.",
