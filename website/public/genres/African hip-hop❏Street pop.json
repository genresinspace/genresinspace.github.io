  "description": "Street pop, also known as street hop, originating in Lagos is an experimental rap-vocal genre that evolved from a fusion of Nigerian hip-hop, popular music, Afrobeats, and Nigerian street music. It draws influence from artists such as Danfo Drivers, [[Baba Fryo]], and [[Daddy Showkey]], as well as the shaku shaku dance style, which was initially inspired by [[gqom]] but eventually developed into its distinct genre. Characterized by vibrant tempos, street pop incorporates elements of gqom, highlife, pop, hip hop, and EDM. While it is predominantly fast-paced, slower variations are also common within the genre. Street pop is known for its melodic arrangements, use of urban colloquial language and Pidgin, and a blend of indigenous and Western rap styles. Variants of street pop include neo-[[Fuji music|fuji]], shaku shaku and zanku.  Prominent figures in the street pop scene are [[Olamide]], [[Phyno]], [[Slimcase (singer)|Slimcase]], [[Mr Real]], Idowest, [[Naira Marley]], [[Zinoleesky]], [[MohBad|Mohbad]], Balloranking, [[Reminisce (rapper)|Reminisce]], [[Rexxie]], [[Zlatan Ibile]], [[Sarz]], [[9ice]], [[Lil Kesh]], [[T.I Blaze]], [[Asake]], [[Portable (musician)|Portable]], [[Bella Shmurda]], [[Seyi Vibez]], [[Qdot]], and [[DJ Kaywise]].",
