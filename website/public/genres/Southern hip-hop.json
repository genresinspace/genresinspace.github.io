  "description": "'''Southern hip-hop''', also known as '''Southern rap''', '''South Coast hip-hop''', or '''dirty south''', is a blanket term for a regional genre of American [[hip-hop]] music that emerged in the [[Southern United States]], especially in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Texas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Florida]]â€”often titled \"The Big 5,\" five states which constitute the \"Southern Network\" in rap music.\n\nThe music was a reaction to the 1980s flow of [[hip-hop culture]] from [[New York City]] and the [[Los Angeles]] area and can be considered the third major American hip-hop scene, alongside [[East Coast hip-hop]] and [[West Coast hip-hop]]. Many early Southern rap artists released their music independently or on [[mixtape]]s after encountering difficulty securing record-label contracts in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, many Southern artists had attained success, and as the decade went on, both mainstream and underground varieties of Southern hip-hop became among the most popular and influential of the entire genre."
