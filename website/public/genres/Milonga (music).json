  "description": "'''Milonga''' is a musical genre that originated in the [[Río de la Plata]] areas of [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and the Brazilian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It is considered a precursor of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]].\n\n\"Milonga is an excited [[habanera (music)|habanera]].\" The original habanera divided into four pulses, in a standard two-four where [[staccatissimo|every note was stressed]]. In becoming milonga, though, all four notes turned strong, as tempo was doubled. The strength of the first beat weakened the fourth giving an almost waltz-like feel to milonga: one-two-three (four), one-two-three (four).\nHabanera is a slower, more explicit sounding ''one'', two, ''three''-four. At least one modern tango pianist believes the [[polka]] influenced the speeding up of the milonga. According to milonga composer and one of the most famous ''[[payador|payadores]]'' of his time, [[Gabino Ezeiza]], the milonga derives from various African rhythms such as [[candombe]], and Argentine milonga was particularly popular among [[Afro-Argentines]] in Buenos Aires at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nOver time, dance steps and other musical influences were added, eventually contributing to the creation of [[Tango (dance)|tango]].",
