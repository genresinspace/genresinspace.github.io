  "description": "'''Zamba''' is an [[Music of Argentina|Argentinian music genre]] and a folk dance. Zamba is very different from its [[homophone]], the [[samba]] - musically, rhythmically, temperamentally, in the steps of the dance and in its costume. It has six beats to the bar and is a majestic dance, performed by couples who circle each other waving white [[handkerchief]]s very elegantly. It has common elements with the [[cueca]].\n\nZambas are composed about many themes, from those that celebrate people or events of [[History of Argentina|Argentine history]], to those that describe the beauty of a region, or of its women. There are zambas of political protest, and even one called ''[[Aerolíneas Argentinas]]''. The ''[[bombo legüero]]'' drum is prominent in the playing of the zamba.",
