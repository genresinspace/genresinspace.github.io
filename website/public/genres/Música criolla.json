  "description": "'''Música criolla''', '''Peruvian Creole music''' or '''''canción criolla''''' is a varied genre of [[Peruvian music]] that exhibits influences from [[European music|European]], [[African music|African]] and [[Andean music|Andean]] music. The genre's name reflects the coastal culture of [[Peru]], and the local evolution of the term ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'', a word originally denoting high-status people of full Spanish ancestry, into a more socially inclusive element of the nation.\n\nFrom the presence of waltzes of Viennese origin, mazurkas, with the influence of French and Italian music from Europe, Lima's popular culture was shaped through the transformation and decantation of genres, transforming the musical genres and imported aesthetic patterns in such a way that, even assuming the fashions corresponding to each era, some musical forms were developed and developed that reach the end of the 20th century and identify what is Peruvian. Each historical moment, from the colonial period until now, was shaped in different ways in the musical culture of Peru through the musical instruments used, the forms and contents of the songs, dances, etc.\n\nAmong the most representative genres of criollo music are the [[Peruvian waltz]] (vals criollo) and the Peruvian polka. It also extends as criollo music the [[Marinera]], the [[Tondero]], the [[Festejo]], the [[Zamacueca]], coplas de amor fino, [[landó]], among others. Peru's national ''[[Día de la Canción Criolla]]'' takes place on October 31.",
