  "description": "'''Austropop''' is [[pop music]] from Austria, which came into use in the late 1960s, but had its heyday in the 1970s and early and up until the mid-1980s. Austropop comprises several musical styles, from traditional pop music to [[Rock music|rock]], and it also sometimes includes traditional folk elements such as [[yodeling]].\n\nAustropop artists usually distinguish themselves from German genres by using decidedly Austrian dialects for their lyrics. For example, [[Neue Deutsche Welle]] does not count as Austropop, as not only do the artists originate from Germany, but  their lyrics are also in [[Standard German]].\n\nThe movement is believed to have started in 1971 by [[Wolfgang Ambros]] with his song \"[[Da Hofa]]\", although this is debated. Ambros became famous, however, by translating songs by [[Bob Dylan]] into Austrian German, the most famous of which is ''\"Naa, i bins ned\"'', the translation of Dylan's ''\"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\"''.\n\nAustropop is still broadcast by various FM radio and TV stations throughout Austria and Bavaria, where they even have special nights replaying Austropop concerts.",
