  "description": "'''Country pop''' (also known as '''urban cowboy''' when referring to the early 1980s version of the genre''')''' is a fusion genre of [[country music]] and [[pop music]] that was developed by members of the country genre out of a desire to reach a larger, mainstream audience. Country pop music blends genres like rock, pop, and country, continuing similar efforts that began in the late 1950s, known originally as the [[Nashville sound]] and later on as [[Countrypolitan]]. By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records charting high on the mainstream [[Contemporary hit radio|top 40]] and the ''Billboard'' country chart. In turn, many pop and [[easy listening]] artists crossed over to country charts during this time. After declining in popularity during the [[neotraditional country|neotraditional]] movement of the 1980s, country pop had a comeback in the 1990s with a sound that drew more heavily on [[pop rock]] and [[adult contemporary]]. In the 2010s, country pop metamorphosized again with the addition of hip-hop beats and rap-style phrasing.",
