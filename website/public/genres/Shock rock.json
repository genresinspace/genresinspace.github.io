  "description": "'''Shock rock''' (also known as '''horror rock''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] which primarily focuses on highly theatrical live performances emphasizing [[shock value]]. The term was originally coined in December 1966 by journalist Robert Shelton to describe [[Frank Zappa]] and his group [[the Mothers of Invention]]. However, the phrase was later popularized during the late 1960s and early 1970s to refer to acts such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Iggy Pop]]. Artists such as [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] and [[Screaming Lord Sutch]] were later regarded as precursors and influences to the genre. By the 1990s and 2000s, \"shock rock\" was used as a term to describe [[Marilyn Manson]].\n\nPerformances may include violent or provocative behavior from the artists, the use of attention-grabbing imagery such as costumes, masks, or face paint, or [[special effects]] such as [[pyrotechnics]] or [[Theatrical blood|fake blood]]. Shock rock also often includes elements of [[horror and terror|horror]].",
