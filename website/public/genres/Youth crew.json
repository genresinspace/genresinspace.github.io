  "description": "'''Youth crew''' is a music subculture of [[hardcore punk]], which was particularly prominent during the [[New York hardcore]] scene of the late 1980s. Youth crew is distinguished from other punk styles by its optimism and moralistic outlook. The original youth crew bands and fans were predominantly [[straight edge]] (abstaining from alcohol and drugs) and [[vegetarian]].\n\nEarly musical influences included [[Minor Threat]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Negative Approach]], [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]], and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. While some youth crew music is similar to [[melodic hardcore]], other styles can be very [[thrash metal]]-influenced and also includes [[Break (music)|breakdowns]] intended for the [[hardcore dancing]] style associated with live performances. [[Youth of Today]] was a very thrashy youth crew band, with abrasive vocals and fast songs too short to include much melody (similar to early Agnostic Front, and contrasting with the other big New York City youth crew bands such as [[Gorilla Biscuits]]). Later youth crew bands took increasing influence from [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].",
