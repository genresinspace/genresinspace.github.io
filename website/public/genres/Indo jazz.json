  "description": "'''Indo jazz''' is a musical genre consisting of [[jazz]], [[European classical music|classical]] and [[Music of India|Indian]] influences. Its structure and patterns are based on Indian music with typical jazz improvisation overlaid. While the term itself may be comparatively recent, the concept dates at least to the mid-1950s. Musicians including [[John Coltrane]], [[Yusef Lateef]] and others reflect Indian influences.\n\n[[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] might be an early example of a jazz group with Indian influences as [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] at that time was a devotee of [[Sri Chinmoy]]. Others found the improvisational elements already in some [[Music of India|Indian music]] to fit well with jazz. Although [[John Mayer (composer)|John Mayer]] and [[Joe Harriott]] are perhaps the most important influences in the movement. In addition [[Alice Coltrane]] is also known for relational work.\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[L.&nbsp;Subramaniam]] pioneered a new movement of Indo-jazz fusion, which he called \"neo-fusion\". It became very popular especially after the release of his albums such as ''Fantasy Without Limits'' (1979), ''Blossom'' (1981), ''Spanish Wave'' (1983), ''Conversations'' (1984), ''Indian Express'' (1985), and ''Mani and Co.'' (1986), in which he collaborated with musicians including [[Stephane Grappelli]], [[George Duke]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[Emil Richards]] among others.\n\nIn America, Broto Roy, [[tabla]] percussionist, began composing and recording his brand of \"Raga-Jazz\" with his debut CD ''American Raga'' (1998), which was taken aboard and played on the [[International Space Station]] when [[Dennis Tito]] (America's first space tourist) blasted off into space. [[List of EMI labels#EMI India|EMI&nbsp;India]] released it in India. His second CD, ''Total Immersion{{snd}} Live at the Kennedy Center'', is only the second CD authorized for public release by the [[Kennedy Center]] (the first was by [[Pavarotti]]). His Quartet has released two CDs: ''Ancient Algorithms'' (2015) and ''All Barriers Fall'' (May 15, 2018)."
