  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''''Shibuya-kei'''''|渋谷系|extra={{lit}} \"Shibuya style\"|lead=yes}} is a [[microgenre]] of [[pop music]] or a general aesthetic{{sfn|McKnight|2009|p=451}} that flourished in Japan in the mid-to-late 1990s.  The music genre is distinguished by a \"cut-and-paste\" approach that was inspired by the [[kitsch]], fusion, and [[Wiktionary:artifice|artifice]] from certain music styles of the past.{{sfn|Tonelli|2004|p=4}} The most common reference points were 1960s culture and Western pop music, especially the work of [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Phil Spector]], and [[Serge Gainsbourg]].\n\nShibuya-kei first emerged as retail music from the [[Shibuya]] district of [[Tokyo]]. [[Flipper's Guitar]], a duo led by [[Kenji Ozawa]] and [[Keigo Oyamada]] (Cornelius), formed the bedrock of the genre and influenced all of its groups, but the most prominent Shibuya-kei band was [[Pizzicato Five]], who fused mainstream [[J-pop]] with a mix of [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], and lounge influences. Shibuya-kei peaked in the late 1990s and declined after its principal players began moving into other music styles.\n\nOverseas, fans of Shibuya-kei were typically [[indie pop]] enthusiasts, partly because many Shibuya-kei records had been distributed through major [[indie label]]s like [[Matador Records|Matador]] and [[Grand Royal Records|Grand Royal]] in the United States and Bungalow in Europe.",
