  "description": "'''Glam rock''' (also known as '''glitter rock''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s and was primarily defined by the hairstyles, [[makeup]], and flamboyant clothing of its musicians, particularly [[platform shoes]] and [[glitter]]. Glam artists drew on diverse sources, ranging from [[bubblegum pop]] and 1950s [[rock and roll]] to [[cabaret]], [[science fiction]], and complex [[art rock]]. The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often [[camp (style)|camp]] or [[androgyny|androgynous]] and have been described as playing with other [[gender role]]s.\n\nThe UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975. The March 1971 appearance of [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] frontman [[Marc Bolan]] on the BBC's music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''—performing \"[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]\"—wearing glitter and satins, is often cited as the beginning of the movement. Other British glam rock artists included [[David Bowie]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Wizzard]] and [[Gary Glitter]]. In the United States, the scene was much less prevalent, but US artists such as [[New York Dolls]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Suzi Quatro]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Jobriath]] achieved success in the UK and/or US. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including [[punk rock]], [[post-punk]], [[gothic rock]] and [[glam metal]]. The [[new romantic]] movement, which began as an underground fashion subculture movement in nightclubs in the late 1970s before becoming mainstream in the early 1980s, was also inspired by the visuals of the glam rock era.",
