  "description": "'''Balkan brass''', popularly known by the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] name ''Truba'' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Труба}}, \"Trumpet\"), is a style of music originating in the Balkan region as a fusion between military music and [[folk music]]. It is popular in the [[Balkans]], especially in [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Moldova]], and [[Romania]].\n\nThe style has influenced techno-synth fusion songs as well as pop music songs such as [[Worth It (Fifth Harmony song)|Worth It]] by [[Fifth Harmony]] and [[Talk Dirty (Jason Derulo song)|Talk Dirty]] by [[Jason Derulo]].\n\nThe energetic and fast [[Beat (music)|beats]] and loud performances encourage dance and audience participation and are egalitarian.\n\nCommon dances to the music include a ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'', a traditional [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] communal dance.\n\nPerformers are called ''trubači'' (''трубачи'') in the [[Serbo-Croatian]], or less commonly, ''trubari.'' [[Romani people]] have adopted the tradition and make up a large percentage of Balkan brass bands. Notable performers include [[Goran Bregović]], [[Boban Marković]], [[Fanfare Ciocărlia]], and New York-based [[Balkan Beat Box]]. The [[Amsterdam Klezmer Band]] fused the Balkan sound with other genres including [[Klezmer]], electronic music, and [[Ska]]. DJs and producers, most prominently [[Shantel]] from Germany, successfully mixed Serbian Brass with electronic beats. DJ Robert Soko's has organized \"Balkan Beats\" parties in Berlin, Germany, since in 1993.\n\nThrough his films including ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]'', [[Emir Kusturica]] has made the style popular outside the Balkans.\n\nThe biggest [[brass band]] event in the world, the [[Guča Trumpet Festival]], is an annual festival in [[Guča]], [[Serbia]].",
