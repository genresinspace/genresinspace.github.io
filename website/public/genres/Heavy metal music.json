  "description": "'''Heavy metal''' (or simply '''metal''') is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[rock music]] that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States. With roots in [[blues rock]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[acid rock]], heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by [[distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars, extended [[guitar solo]]s, emphatic [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[loudness]].\n\nIn 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers – British bands [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]] – were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and [[shock rock]] of [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]; the blues-rooted rock of [[Aerosmith]]; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of [[Van Halen]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence, while [[Motörhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]\" or \"[[headbanging|headbangers]]\". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and [[machismo]], an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became popular with groups such as [[Bon Jovi]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Meanwhile, however, [[Underground music|underground scenes]] produced an array of more aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], while other [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] became – and remain – [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include [[groove metal]] and [[nu metal]], the latter of which often incorporates elements of [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].",
