  "description": "'''Gabber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|b|ər}} {{respell|GAB|ər}}; {{IPA|nl|ˈɣɑbər|lang|nl-gabber.ogg}}) is a style of [[electronic dance music]] and a subgenre of [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], as well as the surrounding subculture. The music is more commonly referred to as '''hardcore''', and is characterised by fast beats, distorted and heavy kickdrums, with dark themes and samples. This style was developed in [[Rotterdam]] and [[Amsterdam]] in the 1990s by producers like [[Marc Trauner|Marc Acardipane]], [[Paul Elstak]], [[DJ Rob]], and [[The Prophet (musician)|The Prophet]], forming record labels such as [[Rotterdam Records]], [[Mokum Records]], Pengo Records and Industrial Strength Records.\n\nThe word ''gabber'' comes from Amsterdam [[Bargoens]] slang and means \"friend\".\n\nGabber remains highly popular in the [[Netherlands]], and has seen a major resurgence in recent years. Gabber formed as an underground, anti-establishment movement with small, underground raves, most often illegally held in empty warehouses, basements and tunnels. [[Rave]] parties such as [[Thunderdome (music festival)|Thunderdome]], held by [[ID&T]] and [[Mysteryland]], became hugely popular, eventually becoming part of mainstream Dutch culture in the 1990s. The music and culture quickly spread across Europe and the world, finding a home with the rave communities in countries such as the UK, Spain, Italy, US, and Australia.",
