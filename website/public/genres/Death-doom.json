  "description": "'''Death-doom''' (also known as '''death-doom metal''' or '''doom-death''') is a fusion genre of [[death metal]] and [[doom metal]]. It combines the slow [[tempos]] and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep [[death growl|growling vocals]] and [[double bass drum|double-kick drumming]] of death metal. The genre emerged in the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death-doom gave rise to the closely related genre of [[funeral doom]] as well as to the more melodic, gloomy and romantic [[gothic metal]].",
