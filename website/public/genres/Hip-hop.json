  "description": "'''Hip-hop''' (also known as '''rap music''' or simply '''rap''') is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[popular music]] that emerged in the early 1970s alongside [[hip-hop culture|an associated subculture]] in the [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Caribbean]] immigrants communities of New York City. The musical style is characterized by the synthesis of a wide range of techniques, but [[rapping]] is frequent enough that it has become a defining characteristic. Other key markers of the genre are the [[disc jockey]] (DJ), [[turntablism]], [[scratching]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip-hop production|instrumental tracks]]. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre; it simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.\n\nThe hip-hop genre and culture emerged from [[block party|block parties]] in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly [[the Bronx]]. DJs began expanding the instrumental [[Break (music)|breaks]] of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended breaks provided a platform for [[Breakdancing|break dancers]] and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were [[disco]] due to its popularity at the time. This disco-inflected music was originally known as disco rap and later described as \"[[old-school hip-hop]]\".\n\nIn the mid-1980s, hip-hop began to diversify as [[electro music]] started to inform the genre's [[new-school hip-hop|new school]]. The period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s became known as hip-hop's \"[[Golden age hip-hop|golden age]]\", as the genre earned widespread critical acclaim and generated massive sales. Across the United States, several regional scenes emerged, most notably on the [[East Coast hip-hop|East]] and [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coasts]], as well as in the [[Southern hip-hop|South]], which included the [[Houston]], [[Atlanta hip-hop|Atlanta]] and [[Memphis rap]] scenes. This era saw the emergence of popular styles such as [[G-funk]], [[boom bap]] and [[gangsta rap]], as well as more experimental genres like [[alternative hip-hop]] and [[jazz rap]], which stemmed from the [[Native Tongues]] movement, alongside [[progressive rap|progressive]] and [[Political hip-hop#conscious hip-hop|conscious hip-hop]].  \n\nIn the late 1990s to mid-2000s, the popularity of hip-hop further expanded with the club-oriented \"bling era\". The late 2000s and early 2010s saw the rise of the \"[[Blog rap|blog era]]\" and [[Internet rap]], with young artists using the [[Internet]] to cultivate a following. In the mid-to-late 2010s, [[trap music]] and [[Soundcloud rap]] surged in popularity, which led to several commercially successful artists. In 2017, hip-hop became the bestselling genre of popular music in the United States and had also developed its own regional variations around the world.",
