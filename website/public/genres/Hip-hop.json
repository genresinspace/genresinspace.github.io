  "description": "'''Hip-hop''' or '''hip hop''' (originally '''disco rap''') is a [[popular music]] [[Music genre|genre]] that emerged in the early 1970s from the [[African Americans|African-American]] community of New York City. The style is characterized by its synthesis of a wide range of musical techniques. Hip-hop includes [[rapping]] often enough that the terms can be used synonymously. However, \"hip-hop\" more properly denotes an entire [[hip-hop culture|subculture]]. Other key markers of the genre are the [[disc jockey]], [[turntablism]], [[scratching]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip hop production|instrumental tracks]]. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre. It simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.\n\nThe hip-hop genre and culture emerged from [[block parties]] in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly [[The Bronx|Bronx]]. DJs began expanding the instrumental [[Break (music)|breaks]] of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended instrumental breaks provided a platform for [[Breakdancing|break dancers]] and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were [[disco]] due to its popularity at the time.\n\nThis disco-inflected music is known as [[old-school hip-hop]]. The genre became more stylistically diverse in the 1980s as [[electro music]] started to inform [[new-school hip-hop]]. The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as hip-hop's [[Golden age hip-hop|Golden age]] as the genre started to earn wide critical acclaim and generate massive sales.\n\nThe popularity of hip-hop music expanded throughout the late 1990s and into the 21st century, where it became a worldwide phenomenon. Most countries have local variations on the style. By 2017, hip-hop had become the bestselling genre of popular music.",
