  "description": "'''Hip-hop''' (also known as '''rap music''' or simply '''rap''') is a [[popular music]] [[Music genre|genre]] that emerged in the early 1970s alongside [[hip-hop culture|an associated subculture]] in the [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] communities of New York City. The musical style is characterized by the synthesis of a wide range of techniques, but [[rapping]] is frequent enough that it has become a defining characteristic. Other key markers of the genre are the [[disc jockey]] (DJ), [[turntablism]], [[scratching]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip hop production|instrumental tracks]]. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre; it simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.\n\nThe hip-hop genre and culture emerged from [[block parties]] in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly [[the Bronx]]. DJs began expanding the instrumental [[Break (music)|breaks]] of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended breaks provided a platform for [[Breakdancing|break dancers]] and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were [[disco]] due to its popularity at the time. This disco-inflected music was originally known as [[disco-rap]] and later described as \"[[old-school hip-hop]]\".\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, hip-hop began to diversify as [[electro music]] started to inform a style later known as \"[[new-school hip-hop]]\". The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as \"[[Golden age hip-hop|hip-hop's golden age]]\", as the genre earned widespread critical acclaim and generated massive sales. Across the United States, several regional scenes emerged, most notably on the [[East Coast hip-hop|East]] and [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coasts]], as well as in the [[Southern hip-hop|South]], which included the [[Houston hip-hop|Houston]], [[Atlanta hip-hop|Atlanta]] and [[Memphis rap]] scenes. This era saw the emergence of popular styles such as [[G-funk]], [[boom bap]] and [[gangsta rap]], as well as more experimental genres like [[alternative hip-hop]] and [[jazz rap]], which stemmed from the [[Native Tongues]] movement, alongside [[progressive rap|progressive]] and [[conscious rap|conscious hip-hop]]. \n\nBy the 2000s and 2010s, the popularity of hip-hop further expanded with the rise of [[internet rap]], [[trap music]], and [[Soundcloud rap]], which led to several commercially successful artists. In 2017, hip-hop became the bestselling genre of popular music in the United States and had also developed its own regional variations around the world.",
