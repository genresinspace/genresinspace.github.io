  "description": "'''Hip-hop''' or '''hip hop''' (originally '''disco rap''', and sometimes '''rap music''' or '''[[rapping|rap]]''') is a [[popular music]] [[Music genre|genre]] that emerged in the early 1970s alongside a [[hip-hop culture|hip-hop subculture]] built by the [[African Americans|African-American]] and [[Latino]] communities of New York City. The musical style is characterized by the synthesis of a wide range of techniques, but [[rapping]] is frequent enough that it has nearly become a defining characteristic. Other key markers of the genre are the [[disc jockey]] (DJ), [[turntablism]], [[scratching]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip hop production|instrumental tracks]]. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre; it simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.\n\nThe hip-hop genre and culture emerged from [[block parties]] in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly [[The Bronx|Bronx]]. DJs began expanding the instrumental [[Break (music)|breaks]] of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended breaks provided a platform for [[Breakdancing|break dancers]] and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were [[disco]] due to its popularity at the time. This disco-inflected music is known as [[old-school hip-hop]].\n\nThe genre became more stylistically diverse in the 1980s as [[electro music]] started to inform [[new-school hip-hop]]. The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as [[Golden age hip-hop|hip-hop's golden age]] as the genre started to earn widespread critical acclaim and generate massive sales.\n\nThe popularity of hip-hop music expanded throughout the late 1990s and into the 21st century, where it further proliferated with the rise of the internet, resulting in many [[internet rap]]-based subgenres. It became a worldwide phenomenon and most countries have local variations on the style. Hip-hop has been the bestselling genre of popular music in the United States since 2017.",
