  "description": "The '''first wave of black metal''' was a musical movement of [[black metal]] which lasted from around 1982 until 1991. Stylistically distinct from the genre's quintessential later sound, the earliest bands in this first wave played a primordial form of [[extreme metal]] that was still indebted to traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. As well as being the origin of modern black metal, the movement also influenced [[thrash metal]], [[crust punk]], [[death metal]] and [[war metal]].\n\n[[Venom (band)|Venom]] initiated the movement, with their second album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982) giving it its name. In the following years, the style was developed by [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]]. The early works of [[thrash metal]] bands [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Kreator]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] and [[Slayer]] are considered part of the first wave of black metal, as is the early work of death metal pioneers [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] and [[Death (metal band)|Death]]. By 1987, this wave had largely declined, but influential releases continued to be issued by [[Tormentor (band)|Tormentor]], [[Parabellum (Colombian band)|Parabellum]], [[Samael (band)|Samael]] and [[Rotting Christ]]. At this time, the works of [[Sarc√≥fago]] and [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]] pioneered war metal, while in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]] developed the style which came to define the subsequent waves of black metal."
