  "description": "'''Oi!''' (originally known as '''new punk''' or '''real punk''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[punk rock]] that emerged in the United Kingdom, particularly the [[East End of London]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term was originally coined by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine writer [[Garry Bushell]] in August 1979. The music and its associated [[subculture]] aimed to unite [[punk subculture|punks]], [[skinhead]]s, and general disaffected [[working class|working-class]] youth.   \n\nThe movement was partly a response to the perception that many participants in the early [[UK punk scene]] were, in the words of [[The Business (band)|The Business]] guitarist Steve Kent, \"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic... and losing touch.\" The movement was later associated with [[Conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservative]] and [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far-right]] ideologies. \n\nNotable acts included [[Sham 69]], [[Cock Sparrer]], [[Angelic Upstarts]], [[the 4-Skins]], [[The Business (band)|the Business]], [[Anti-Establishment (band)|Anti-Establishment]], [[Blitz (British band)|Blitz]], [[The Blood (band)|the Blood]] and [[Combat 84]].",
