  "description": "'''Blackgaze''' is a fusion genre combining elements of [[black metal]] and [[shoegaze]]. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres, described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as \"the [[buzzword|buzz term]] for a new school of bands taking black metal out of the shadows and melding its [[blast beat]]s, dungeon [[screaming (music)|wailing]] and razorwire guitars with the more reflective melodies of [[post-rock]], [[shoegaze]] and [[post-hardcore]].\" According to ''[[Exclaim!]]'', blackgaze \"marries the harsh, alien instrumentation of black metal with the mellower, dreamy soundscapes of shoegaze.\"\n\nInfluenced by [[atmospheric black metal]] bands like [[Ulver]] and [[Summoning (band)|Summoning]], the genre was pioneered by French musician [[Neige (musician)|Neige]] around 2005 through the projects [[Alcest]] and [[Amesoeurs]] and has risen to prominence with the success of American group [[Deafheaven]]. ''The Guardian'' named Deafheaven \"blackgaze's de facto poster boys, the most likely to open up black metal to an even wider audience\", and ''Exclaim!'' described their second album ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]'' – the most critically acclaimed album of 2013 on [[Metacritic]] – as seminal to blackgaze.",
