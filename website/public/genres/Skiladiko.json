  "description": "'''Skiladiko''' or '''Skyladiko''' ({{langx|el|Σκυλάδικο}}, {{IPA|el|sciˈlaðiko|pron}}) is a derogatory term to describe a branch of [[laiko]] music and some of the current [[nightclubs in Greece]] in which this music is performed. It also refers to the so-called \"decadent\" form of laiko, and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for dog (σκύλος, ''skilos''), meaning \"doggish\" or \"doghouse\". The term was also used to refer to cheap or often unlicensed [[Greece|Greek]] night clubs with a usually shady reputation of Greek music on the outskirts of a Greek city or town. The typical arrangement in current skiladika establishments includes an elevated stage (\"palco\") where singers and musicians perform Greek songs, with the use of heavily amplified [[bouzouki]], [[electric guitars]] and other [[Greek musical instruments|instruments]].",
