  "description": "'''Yuka''' is a secular [[Afro-Cuban]] musical tradition which involves drumming, singing and dancing. It was developed in western Cuba by [[Kongo people|Kongo]] slaves during colonial times. Yuka predates other Afro-Cuban genres of dance music like [[Cuban rumba|rumba]] and has survived in Kongo communities of [[Pinar del Río Province|Pinar del Río]], specifically in El Guayabo and Barbacoa, [[San Luis, Pinar del Río|San Luis]]. Since the 1940s, yuka performances have been recorded by researchers such as [[Harold Courlander]] and María Teresa Linares."
