  "description": "'''Shoegaze''' (originally called '''shoegazing''' and sometimes conflated with [[dream pop]]) is a subgenre of [[indie rock|indie]] and [[alternative rock]] characterized by its ethereal mixture of obscured vocals, guitar [[distortion (music)|distortion]] and effects, [[audio feedback|feedback]] and overwhelming volume. It emerged in Ireland and the United Kingdom in the late 1980s among [[neo-psychedelic]] groups who usually stood motionless during live performances in a detached, non-confrontational state. The name comes from the heavy use of [[effects pedals]], as the performers were often looking down at their pedals during such concerts.\n\n[[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and their 1991 album ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]'' are widely regarded as defining the genre. A loose label given to the shoegaze bands and other affiliated bands in London in the early 1990s was \"the scene that celebrates itself\". Most shoegaze artists drew from the template set by My Bloody Valentine on their late 1980s recordings, as well as bands such as [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] and [[Cocteau Twins]].\n\nIn the early 1990s, shoegaze was sidelined by American [[grunge]] and early [[Britpop]] acts, resulting in relatively unknown bands breaking up or reinventing their style altogether. Since the late 2010s, a renewed interest in the genre has been noted, namely among [[nu gaze]] and [[blackgaze]] bands.",
