  "description": "'''Shoegaze''' (also known as '''shoegazing''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie rock|indie]] and [[alternative rock]] characterised by its ethereal mixture of obscured vocals, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], [[guitar pedal]] effects, [[audio feedback|feedback]] and overwhelming volume. The sound originally emerged in Ireland and the United Kingdom during the late 1980s among [[Neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic]] groups who usually stood motionless, staring down during live performances in a detached, non-confrontational state.\n\nA loose label given to the shoegaze bands and other affiliated artists in London during the early 1990s was \"the scene that celebrates itself\". Shoegaze was sometimes conflated with [[dream pop]]. Most artists drew from [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]] and [[Cocteau Twins]], alongside the template set by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and their albums ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]'' and ''[[Isn't Anything]]''. \n\nDuring the early 1990s, shoegaze was sidelined by American [[grunge]] and early [[Britpop]] acts, resulting in bands breaking up or reinventing their style altogether. By the 2000s and late 2010s, a renewed interest in the genre began, leading to the emergence of [[Fusion genre|fusion]] and subgenres like [[shitgaze]], [[Witch house (genre)|witch house]], [[nu gaze]] and [[blackgaze]].\n\n{{toclimit}}",
