  "description": "'''Shoegaze''' (originally known as '''shoegazing''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie rock|indie]] and [[alternative rock]] characterised by its ethereal soundscapes, use of obscured vocals, heavy [[guitar effects]], and [[distortion (music)|distortion]], often producing an immersive \"[[wall of sound]]\". Shoegaze originated in the [[United Kingdom]] during the late 1980s among [[Neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic]] groups, who drew influence from [[post-punk]] and [[dream pop]].  The term was coined by the British music press to describe bands who usually stood motionless and stared down at their [[guitar pedals]] during live performances in a detached, non-confrontational state.  \n\nA loose label given to the shoegaze bands and other affiliated artists in [[London]] during the early 1990s was \"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\". Early shoegaze groups drew from [[Cocteau Twins]] and [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]], alongside the template set by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] on their albums ''[[Isn't Anything]]'' and ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]''. \n\nThe genre reached its peak in the early 1990s, particularly in the UK's underground [[rock music|rock]] scene, but was soon sidelined by American [[grunge]] and early [[Britpop]] acts, leading many bands to break up or reinvent their sound. By the 2000s and 2010s, shoegaze experienced a revival known as \"[[nu gaze]]\".  The original scene also led to the emergence of [[Fusion genre|fusion genres]] such as [[blackgaze]], and influenced several internet [[microgenres]] such as [[shitgaze]] and [[Witch house (genre)|witch house]]. By the 2020s, a new shoegaze revival would be spearheaded by [[Generation Z]] artists, known as \"[[zoomergaze]]\".{{toclimit}}",
