  "description": "'''Shoegaze''' (originally '''shoegazing''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie rock|indie]] and [[alternative rock]] characterised by ethereal soundscapes, obscured vocals, and extensive use of guitar effects and [[distortion (music)|distortion]], often producing an immersive \"[[wall of sound]]\". The style originated in the UK, particularly in [[London]] and the greater [[Thames Valley]] region, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The term was coined by music executive [[Andy Ross (music executive)|Andy Ross]] and was later used by the British music press to describe shoegaze bands' motionless stage presence, during which musicians directed their look down toward their [[guitar pedals|effects pedals]].\n\nA British music-press label applied to shoegaze bands and affiliated artists in the early-1990s London club scene was \"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\". Artists that were associated with the Scene drew primarily from [[dream pop]] band [[Cocteau Twins]], as well as from the sonic template established by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] on their 1988 EP ''[[You Made Me Realise|You Made Me Realise]]'' and their debut album ''[[Isn't Anything]]''.\n\nThe genre reached its peak in 1991 with the release of My Bloody Valentine's second album, ''[[Loveless (album)|Loveless]]'', but was  overshadowed by the rise of the American [[grunge]] scene and the following [[Britpop]] movement. In the 2000s, shoegaze experienced a revival. During the 2010s, the offshoot [[blackgaze]] emerged, while unrelated music styles, such as [[Witch house (genre)|witch house]], adopted aspects of shoegaze's atmosphere. In the 2020s, the revival was spearheaded by [[Generation Z|Gen Z]] artists, sometimes referred to as \"[[zoomergaze]]\".",
