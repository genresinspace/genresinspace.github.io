  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''''Enka'''''|演歌}} is a Japanese music genre considered to resemble traditional Japanese music stylistically. '''Modern ''enka''''', however, is a relatively recent musical form which adopts a more traditional musical style in its vocalism than ''[[ryūkōka]]'' music, popular during the [[Interwar period|prewar]] years.\n\nModern ''enka'', as developed in the postwar era, is a form of [[Sentimental ballad|sentimental ballad music]]. Some of the first modern ''enka'' singers were [[Hachiro Kasuga]], [[Michiya Mihashi]], and [[Hideo Murata]]. The revival of ''enka'' in its modern form is said to date from 1969, when [[Keiko Fuji]] made her debut. The most famous male ''enka'' singers are [[Shinichi Mori]] and [[Kiyoshi Hikawa]].",
