  "description": "'''Viking rock''' ({{lang|sv|Vikingarock}}) is a [[rock music]] genre that takes much of its [[Viking revival|themes]] from 19th-century [[Viking romanticism]], mixing it with elements of [[rockabilly]], [[Oi!]] or [[street punk]], and [[folk music]]. Frequent themes occurring in Viking rock include [[vikings]] and [[Norse mythology]], as well as Sweden's King [[Karl XII]] and the [[Caroleans]].\n\nViking rock is often linked to [[white supremacy]]. Many make no distinction between Viking rock and white power music, and there is debate whether Viking rock is essentially [[Racism|racist]]. Some viking rock bands, however,  disapprove of racism such as the Swedish band Hel.\n\nKuggn√§sfestivalen is a music festival that caters to viking rock.",
