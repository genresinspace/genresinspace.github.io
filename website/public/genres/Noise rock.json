  "description": "'''Noise rock''' (sometimes called '''noise punk'''){{sfn|Felix|2010|p=172}} is a [[noise music|noise]]-oriented style of [[experimental rock]] that spun off from [[punk rock]] in the 1980s. Drawing on movements such as [[minimal music|minimalism]], [[industrial music]], and [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]],{{sfn|Blush|2016|p=266}} artists fuse rock music to noise, while utilizing extreme levels of distortion through the use of [[electric guitar]]s and, less frequently, [[electronic instrument]]ation, either to provide percussive sounds or to contribute to the overall arrangement.\n\nSome groups are tied to song structures, such as [[Sonic Youth]]. Although they are not representative of the entire genre, they helped popularize noise rock among [[alternative rock]] audiences by incorporating melodies into their droning textures of sound, which set a template that numerous other groups followed. Other early noise rock bands were [[Big Black]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]] and [[the Jesus Lizard]].",
