  "description": "'''Eurodance''' (sometimes referred to as '''Euro-NRG''') is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that originated in the late 1980s in [[Europe]]. It combines many elements of [[Hip-hop|rap]], [[techno]] and [[Eurodisco]]. This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich vocals, sometimes with [[Rapping|rapped]] verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizers, strong [[Bass (sound)|bass]] [[rhythm]] and melodic [[Hook (music)|hooks]], establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music."
