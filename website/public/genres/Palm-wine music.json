  "description": "'''Palm-wine music''' (known as '''maringa''' in [[Sierra Leone]]) is a [[West Africa]]n [[musical genre]]. It evolved among the [[Kru people]] of [[Liberia]] and Sierra Leone, who used [[Portuguese guitar]]s brought by sailors, combining local melodies and rhythms with [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[calypso music|calypso]] to create a \"light, easy, lilting style\". It would initially work its way inland where it would adopt a more traditional style than what was played in coastal areas.\n\nIt would eventually gain popularity after Sierra Leone musician Ebenezer Calendar recorded songs in the 1950s and 1960s and continues to hold a small amount of that popularity."
