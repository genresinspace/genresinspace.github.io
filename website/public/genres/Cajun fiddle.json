  "description": "'''Cajun fiddle''' music is a part of the [[American fiddle]] music canon. It is derived from the music of  southwest [[Louisiana]] and southeast [[Texas]], as well as sharing repertoire from the [[Quebec]] and [[Cape Breton Island]] traditions. It is one of the few extant North American folk music traditions rooted in French [[chanson]].\nAccording to Ron Yule, \"Louisiana fiddling had its birth roots in Europe, with fiddling being noted as early as the 1400s in Scotland\". [[Zydeco]] music is a geographically, culturally, and musically related style.",
