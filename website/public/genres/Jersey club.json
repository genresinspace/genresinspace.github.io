  "description": "'''Jersey club''' (originally called '''Brick City club''') is a style of [[electronic dance music|electronic club music]] that originated in [[Newark, New Jersey]], in the late 90s/early 2000s. It was pioneered by [[DJ Tameil]], Mike V, DJ Tim Dolla, and DJ Black Mic of the Brick Bandits crew, who were inspired by [[Baltimore club]]'s uptempo hybrid of [[house music|house]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Subsequent young producers pushed for the progression of the style in the late 2000s, bringing it to global audiences.\n\nSimilarly to its Baltimore influences, Jersey club is an aggressive style defined by its fast, “bouncy” groove at tempos near 130–140 BPM, but more prominent use of [[staccato]], chopped [[sample (music)|samples]] and heavy [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] or [[Swing time#Swing as a rhythmic style|shuffled]] [[Triplet (music)|triplet]] kick patterns. The style often consists of [[remix]]es of [[rap music|rap]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] tracks. It is often accompanied by frenetic, competitive dances which have gained global popularity through [[viral videos]].",
