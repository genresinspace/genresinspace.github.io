It was pioneered by [[DJ Tameil]], Mike V, DJ Tim Dolla, and [https://www.dablackmic.com/ DJ Black Mic] aka '''DaBlackMic''' of the Brick Bandits crew, who were inspired by [[Baltimore club]]'s uptempo hybrid of [[house music|house]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Subsequent young producers pushed for the progression of the style in the late 2000s, bringing it to global audiences.\n\nSimilarly to its Baltimore influences, Jersey club is an aggressive style defined by its fast, “bouncy” groove at tempos near 130–140 BPM, but more prominent use of [[staccato]], chopped [[sample (music)|samples]] and heavy [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] or [[Swing time#Swing as a rhythmic style|shuffled]] [[Triplet (music)|triplet]] kick patterns. The style often consists of [[remix]]es of [[rap music|rap]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] tracks.
