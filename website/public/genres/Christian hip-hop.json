  "description": "'''Christian hip-hop''' (originally '''gospel rap''', also known as '''Christian rap''', '''gospel hip-hop''' or '''holy hip-hop''') is a cross-genre of [[contemporary Christian music]] and [[hip-hop]]. It emerged from [[urban contemporary music]] and [[Christian media]] in the United States during the 1980s.\n\nChristian hip-hop music first emerged on record in 1982 with a track entitled \"Jesus Christ (The Gospel Beat)\" by Queens, New York artist McSweet. The first full-length Christian hip-hop album, ''Bible Break'', by Oklahoma artist [[Stephen Wiley]], was released in 1985, with the title track becoming a hit on [[Christian radio]] in 1986. Other early Christian hip recording artists from the mid-1980s included [[P.I.D.]] (Preachas in Disguise), who recorded to funky rock rhythms, as well as JC & the Boys and Michael Peace. During the 1990s and 2000s, rapper [[KJ-52]] rose to prominence in the field.\n\n[[Christian rock]] band [[DC Talk]] blended hip-hop and rock, and were successful in mainstream [[Christian music]]. All three band members have had successful independent careers, [[Michael Tait]] and [[Kevin Max|Kevin Max Smith]] in [[Christian pop]], and [[TobyMac]] as a Christian rapper and label owner. Along with [[Lecrae]], [[NF (rapper)|NF]], [[KB (rapper)|KB]] & [[Emcee N.I.C.E.]] who have emerged recently on the mainstream rap scene along with [[American popular music]] figures [[DMX]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Kanye West]]. Outside of the United States, there are Christian rap scenes in the UK, Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. Asian, Black, and Latino rappers are becoming a major part of the genre, and this success is expanding the appeal of both Christian hip-hop and [[Christian electronic dance music|Christian EDM]] within general hip-hop and broader [[popular music]].",
