  "description": "'''New rave''' (also typeset as '''nu-rave''', '''nu rave''' or '''neu rave''') is a genre of music described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as \"an in-yer-face, [[Do it yourself|DIY]] [[disco]] riposte to the sensitive [[indie rock]] touted by bands like [[Bloc Party]].\" It is most commonly applied to a [[United Kingdom|British]]-based music scene between 2005 and late 2008 of fast-paced electronica-influenced indie music that celebrated the late 1980s [[Madchester]] and [[rave]] scenes through the use of neon colours and using the term 'raving' to refer to going [[nightclubs|nightclubbing]]."
