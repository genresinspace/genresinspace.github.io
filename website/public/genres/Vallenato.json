  "description": "'''Vallenato''' ({{IPA|es-419|baʝeˈnato}}) is a popular [[folk music]] genre from [[Colombia]]. It primarily comes from its [[Caribbean Region (Colombia)|Caribbean region]]. ''Vallenato'' literally means \"born in the valley\".  The valley influencing this name is located between the ''[[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]'' and the ''[[Serranía de Perijá]]'' in north-east Colombia. The name also applies to the people from the city where this genre originated: [[Valledupar]] (from the place named ''Valle de Upar'' – \"Valley of Upar\"). In 2006, vallenato and cumbia were added as a category in the [[Latin Grammy Awards]]. Colombia's traditional vallenato music is [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, according to [[UNESCO]].",
