  "description": "'''Donk''', also known as Bounce or Hard Bounce, is a style of UK Hard House \"featuring an upbeat, energetic sound and a heavy focus on the 'pipe' sample as an offbeat bassline\". There is debate about Donk's origin, but the sounds are thought to have come from the [[Netherlands]] in the 1990s. The name itself is a neologism, derived from the scene in the UK. In the UK, the style originated in [[North West England]], around towns and cities such as [[Wigan]], [[Liverpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Blackburn]], and [[Burnley]], and was first known as Scouse House or Bounce - as it spread out of the area and became more mainstream, it became known as Donk. \"Donk\" was the name given to the \"particularly rubbery, rebounding thwack\" sound that predominated Donk tracks and became \"the umbrella term for the genres that feature it\". In other parts of Europe, the versions of Donk are known as [[#Pumping house|bumping]] and poky (Spain); in Russia, as [[#Hardbass|Hardbass]]. Critic [[Simon Reynolds]] drew comparisons with American regional hip hop styles, such as [[bounce music|bounce]], [[crunk]], [[hyphy]], [[snap music|snap]] and [[Footwork (genre)|juke music]]",
