Artists in the 21st century include [[Tenacious D]], [[Flight of the Conchords]], [[The Lonely Island]], [[Ninja Sex Party]] and [[The Axis of Awesome]].\n\nComedy music is often associated with [[counterculture]], due to the subversive messages it displays. This informative nature of comedy music also contributes to the improvement of learning inside and outside the classroom. Forms of entertainment like musical theatre often incorporate comedy music as well.\n\nTo create comic effects in music, Composers have developed several principal [[Musical composition|compositional]] techniques, including the use of comic text, musical parody, and unexpected juxtapositions of syntactical elements among others. Comedy music can be further categorized into several types, such as [[parody music]], [[novelty song]], [[comedy rock]], and [[comedy hip hop]]. Awards dedicated to comedy music include the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture â€“ Musical or Comedy]], and the Musical Comedy Awards.",
