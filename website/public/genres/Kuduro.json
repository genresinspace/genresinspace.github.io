  "description": "'''Kuduro''' (or '''kuduru''') is a type of music and dance born in [[Angola]]. It is characterized as uptempo, energetic, and danceable. Kuduro was developed in [[Luanda]], Angola, in the late 1980s. Producers sampled traditional carnival music like [[soca music|soca]] and zouk b√©ton (\"hard\" [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]]) from the Caribbean to Angola, [[House music|house]] and [[techno]] playing from Europe.\n\nThe kuduro is similar to [[semba]]. Its rhythm is laid out on a fast [[four-to-the-floor beat]] [[bass drum]] and some other instrument ([[snare drum]], sidestick, etc.) performing the first two hits of the [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] pattern.",
