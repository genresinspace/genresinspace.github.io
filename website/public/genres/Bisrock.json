  "description": "'''BisRock''' is a subgenre of [[Pinoy rock]], propagated by the [[Cebu]] rock music industry in the [[Philippines]]. The term, which is in the [[Blend word|blended]] form, comes from the [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words ''Bisaya'', referring the [[Visayan languages]], and \"rock\", for [[rock music]]. The term was coined by Cebuano writer Januar E. Yap in 2002 and was first applied to [[Missing Filemon]]'s first album. Earning wide reception among the young in the Visayas and Mindanao, Bisrock is a fairly recent cultural phenomenon. The style started around the 1980s, when Cebu's rock scene was beginning to be labeled as \"Bisrock\". During this time, a group of musicians from the [[University of San Carlos]] coined the local music scene as Bisrock in support of patriotism for the Cebuano music scene. However, this genre is debatable as Bisrock seems to be popular only in Cebu. As it is, the movement died down around 2009, as even Missing Filemon themselves distanced itself from the term \"Bisrock\".",
