  "description": "'''Skate punk''' (also known as '''skatecore''' and '''skate rock''') is a [[skateboarding|skater]] subculture and [[punk rock]] [[Music genre|subgenre]] that developed in the 1980s. Originally a form of [[hardcore punk]] that had been closely associated with skate culture, skate punk evolved into a more melodic genre of punk rock in the 1990s similar to [[pop punk]]. Since then, it has predominately featured fast tempos, [[lead guitar]] playing (including [[guitar riff]]s and [[guitar solo]]s), fast drumming, and singing (sometimes including vocal harmonies). Occasionally, skate punk also combines the fast tempos of hardcore punk and [[melodic hardcore]] with the catchy hooks of pop-punk.\n\n1970s and early 1980s punk rock bands like [[Buzzcocks]], [[Descendents]], [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and [[Circle Jerks]] paved the way for skate punk. Skate punk was pioneered in the 1980s by bands such as the [[Big Boys (band)|Big Boys]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[JFA (band)|JFA]], [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Drunk Injuns]] and [[Love Canal]]. Many early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement [[nardcore]], which emerged in [[Oxnard, California]]. Skate punk band [[Bad Religion]] started the more melodic style of skate punk in 1988 with the band's influential album ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]''. This melodic style of skate punk continued in the 1990s with bands like [[NOFX]], [[Lagwagon]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], and [[No Use for a Name]].\n\nSkate punk broke into the mainstream during the 1990s with bands such as [[the Offspring]] and [[Blink-182]]. Other bands, like NOFX, Pennywise, Face to Face, [[MxPx]] and Bad Religion, achieved underground to moderate success. Many skate punk bands' songs were featured in ''[[Tony Hawk's]]'' video games, a series that sold millions. Punk's popularity continued in the early 2000s with many bands continuing to make albums that received a lot of attention. During the 2010s, later skate punk bands such as [[Trash Boat]], [[Cerebral Ballzy]], and [[Trash Talk (band)|Trash Talk]], achieved underground success through the influence of previous skate punk bands.",
