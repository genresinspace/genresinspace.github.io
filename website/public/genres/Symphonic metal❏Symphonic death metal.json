  "description": "Bands described as '''symphonic death metal''' include [[Ex Deo]], [[Septicflesh]], [[Children of Bodom]], [[Mayan (band)|MaYaN]], and [[Fleshgod Apocalypse]]. [[Haggard (band)|Haggard]]'s 2000 album, ''[[Awaking the Centuries]]'', has been described as death metal–styled symphonic metal. [[Eternal Tears of Sorrow]], [[Starkill]], and [[Wintersun]] are known for their symphonic [[melodic death metal]] sound. [[Mechina (band)|Mechina]] combines symphonic death metal with [[industrial metal]].\n\nThe symphonic death metal scene includes [[deathcore]] bands mixing the two genres together, starting in the late 2000s with [[The Breathing Process]] and [[Winds of Plague]]. In the early 2010s, [[Make Them Suffer]] developed the symphonic deathcore subgenre further in their earlier material, as did [[Betraying the Martyrs]], known to \"temper the punishing brutality of deathcore with melodic flourishes pulled from symphonic and [[progressive metal]], giving it a theatricality that feels distinctly European.\" It was not until the late 2010s and early 2020s when the symphonic deathcore scene started rising in popularity with bands like [[Shadow of Intent]], [[Lorna Shore]], [[A Wake in Providence (band)|A Wake in Providence]], and [[Drown in Sulphur]]. Some bands such as [[Worm Shepherd]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]] in their later albums, and [[Mental Cruelty]] combine the genre with [[symphonic black metal]].",
