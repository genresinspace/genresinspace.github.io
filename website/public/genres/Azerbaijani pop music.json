  "description": "'''Azerbaijani pop music''' ({{langx|az|Az…ôrbaycan pop musiqisi}}) is a [[pop music]] created in [[Azerbaijan]]. The emergence of [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] pop music dates back to the mid-20th century. Growth of new generation of musicians in the 1970s positively influenced Azerbaijan pop music's \"golden age\". Performers of traditional pop music such as [[Mirza Babayev]], [[Flora Karimova]] and [[Shovkat Alakbarova]] achieved great success at that time. Contemporary Azerbaijani pop music has its roots in traditional Azerbaijani folk music.\n\nAs a result of globalisation, Azerbaijani pop music has been heavily influenced by both dance and electronic forms of pop music of the 1980s, as well as by genres of the 2000s such as [[electropop]], [[dance-pop]] and [[synth-pop]]. In 2011, the song [[Running Scared (Ell & Nikki song)]], performed by the duo [[Ell & Nikki]], was Azerbaijan's first-ever victory on European song contest [[Eurovision]].",
