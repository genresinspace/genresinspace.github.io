  "description": "'''EDM trap music''' (also simply known as '''EDM trap''' or '''trap''') is a fusion genre of [[hip-hop]], [[Rave music|rave]], and [[electronic dance music]] (EDM), that originated in the early 2010s on peaking popularity of [[big room house]] and [[Trap music|hip hop trap]] genres. It blends elements of hip hop trap, which is an offshoot of [[Southern hip hop]], with elements of EDM like build-ups, [[Drop (music)|drops]], dense production with rave music synthesizers, and [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]]. As it was popularized, it increasingly began incorporating more [[Pop music|pop]] elements. EDM trap songs and production are typically very dynamic, boisterous, experimental, and sparky in comparison to the hip-hop version of trap, due to its EDM and rave music elements, tendencies and structure.",
