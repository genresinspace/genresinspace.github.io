  "description": "'''Rock and roll''' (often written as '''rock & roll''', '''rock-n-roll''', and '''rock 'n' roll''') is a [[Genre (music)|genre]] of [[popular music]] that evolved in the [[United States]] during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The [[Origins of rock and roll|origins of rock and roll]] include a mix of styles, mainly [[rhythm and blues]] and [[country music]], with influence from [[gospel music|gospel]], [[jazz]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[electric blues]], [[jump blues]], [[swing music|swing]], and [[folk music]]. While rock and roll's early elements can be heard in [[blues]] records from the 1920s and in [[country music|country]] records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as [[rock music]], though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll\". For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\n\nIn the earliest ''rock and roll'' styles, either the [[piano]] or [[saxophone]] was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the [[electric guitar]] in the mid-to-late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated [[backbeat]], almost always provided by a [[snare drum]]. Minimal blues [[chord progression]]s such as the [[twelve-bar blues]] are commonly used. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more [[electric guitar]]s (one [[lead guitar|lead]], one [[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]) and a [[double bass]] (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric [[bass guitar]]s (\"Fender bass\") and [[drum kit]]s became popular in classic rock.\n\nRock and roll had a profound influence on contemporary American lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, and is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe{{Who|date=August 2025}} that the music had a positive influence on the [[civil rights movement]], because of its widespread appeal to both [[Black American]] and [[White American]] teenagers.",
