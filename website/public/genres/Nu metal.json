  "description": "'''Nu metal''' (sometimes stylized as '''n√º-metal''', with a [[metal umlaut]]) is a subgenre of {{nowrap|[[alternative metal]]}} that combines elements of [[heavy metal music]] with elements of other music genres such as [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[grunge]]. Nu metal rarely features [[guitar solo]]s or other displays of [[musical technique]] and emphasizes rhythm with instrumentation that is heavily [[Syncopation|syncopated]]. Nu metal guitarists often use [[seven-string guitar]]s that are [[guitar tunings|down-tuned]] to produce a heavier sound. Vocal styles are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop, and include [[singing]], [[rapping]], [[screaming (music)|screaming]] and sometimes [[death growl|growl]]ing. [[Turntablism|DJs]] are occasionally featured to provide instrumentation such as [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], turntable [[scratching]] and [[electronic musical instrument|electronic]] background music. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the [[new wave of American heavy metal]]. \n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like [[Pantera]], [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], and [[Faith No More]] were influential in the development of nu-metal with their [[groove metal]] and alternative metal styles. [[Korn]] is often credited as pioneering the subgenre in the mid-1990s with their [[Korn (album)|self-titled]] debut album. Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s, with bands and artists such as Korn, [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Its popularity continued through the early 2000s, with bands such as [[Papa Roach]], [[Staind]], and [[P.O.D.]] all selling multi-platinum albums. The popularity of nu metal came to a peak in 2001 with [[Linkin Park]]'s diamond-selling album ''[[Hybrid Theory]]''. By the mid-2000s, however, the oversaturation of bands combined with the underperformance of several high-profile releases led to the subgenre's decline, leading to the rise of [[metalcore]] and many nu-metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.\n\nThe 2010s brought a nu-metal revival; many bands that combined it with other genres (for example, [[metalcore]] and [[deathcore]]) emerged, and some nu-metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu-metal sound. Bands such as [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]], [[Emmure]], [[Issues (band)|Issues]], [[My Ticket Home]], and [[Bring Me the Horizon]] combined nu metal with metalcore or deathcore. Artists like [[Grimes]], [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]], and [[Rina Sawayama]] integrated nu-metal sounds into [[Electropop|electronic pop music]] in the late 2010s and early 2020s, and interest in nu metal rose in the early 2020s.",
