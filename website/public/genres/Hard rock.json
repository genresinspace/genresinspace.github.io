  "description": "'''Hard rock''' or '''heavy rock''' is a heavier subgenre of [[rock music]] typified by aggressive vocals and [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]]s. Hard rock began in the mid-1960s with the [[Garage rock|garage]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[blues rock]] movements. Some of the earliest hard rock music was produced by [[the Kinks]], [[the Who]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Vanilla Fudge]], and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]. In the late 1960s, bands such as [[Blue Cheer]], [[the Jeff Beck Group]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Golden Earring]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Free (band)|Free]], and [[Deep Purple]] also produced hard rock.\n\nThe genre developed into a major form of [[popular music]] in the 1970s, with the Who, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple being joined by [[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[AC/DC]], [[Thin Lizzy]] and [[Van Halen]]. During the 1980s, some hard rock bands moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards [[pop rock]]. Established bands made a comeback in the mid-1980s and hard rock reached a commercial peak in the 1980s with [[glam metal]] bands such as [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Def Leppard]] as well as the rawer sounds of [[Guns N' Roses]] which followed with great success in the later part of that decade.\n\nHard rock began losing popularity with the commercial success of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[Urban contemporary music|urban pop]], [[grunge]] and later [[Britpop]] in the 1990s. Despite this, many [[post-grunge]] bands adopted a hard rock sound and the 2000s saw a renewed interest in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.",
