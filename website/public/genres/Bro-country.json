Bro-country songs are often musically upbeat with lyrics about attractive young women, the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], partying, blue jeans, boots, and [[pickup truck]]s.\n\nThe first use of the term was by [[Jody Rosen]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in an article published on August 11, 2013, in which Rosen described songs by [[Florida Georgia Line]], particularly their debut single \"[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]\". Rosen also named [[Luke Bryan]], [[Jason Aldean]], and [[Jake Owen]] among singers of the genre. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' cited \"[[Boys 'Round Here]]\" by [[Blake Shelton]] and \"[[Ready Set Roll]]\" by [[Chase Rice]]  as other examples of bro-country. The popularity of the genre opened up a divide between the older generation of country singers and contemporary artists with a more traditional-leaning sound, and the bro-country singers which was described as \"civil war\" by musicians, critics and journalists."
