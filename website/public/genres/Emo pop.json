  "description": "'''Emo pop''' (alternatively typeset with a hyphen, also known as '''emo pop-punk''' and '''pop-emo''') is a fusion genre combining [[emo]] with [[pop-punk]], [[pop music]], or both. Emo pop features a musical style with more concise composition and [[Hook (music)|hook]]-filled [[refrain|chorus]]es. Emo pop has its origins in the 1990s with bands like [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[the Get Up Kids]], [[Weezer]] and [[the Promise Ring]]. The genre entered the mainstream in the early 2000s with Jimmy Eat World's breakthrough album ''[[Bleed American]]'', which included its song \"[[The Middle (Jimmy Eat World song)|The Middle]]\". Other emo pop bands that achieved mainstream success throughout the decade included [[Fall Out Boy]], [[the All-American Rejects]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Panic! at the Disco]] and [[Paramore]]. The popularity of emo pop declined in the 2010s, with some prominent artists in the genre either disbanding or abandoning the emo pop style.",
