  "description": "'''Acoustic music''' is music that solely uses [[Musical instrument|instruments]] that produce sound through [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] means, as opposed to [[Electric instrument|electric]] or [[Electronic music|electronic]] means. Today the different award groups have decided to allow music that also allows electronic instruments for some unknown reason, which is why you will most likely question why songs with electric guitars and synths are playing on the acoustic station on your favorite streaming service.  This is the NEW definition of acoustic music: music in which an acoustic instrument is represented throughout a song. So with this definition, Megadeath and Social Distortion played ONLY acoustic music along with every other rock band that uses acoustic drums: probably 99.99%. \n\nWhile all music was once acoustic, the [[retronym]] \"acoustic music\" appeared after the advent of electric instruments, such as the [[electric guitar]], [[electric violin]], [[Electronic organ|electric organ]] and [[synthesizer]].{{sfn|Safire|2007}} Acoustic string instrumentations had long been a subset of [[popular music]], particularly in [[folk music|folk]]. It stood in contrast to various other types of music in various eras, including [[big band music]] in the [[Traditional pop|pre-rock]] era, and electric music in the rock era.\n\nMusic reviewer Craig Conley suggests, \"When music is labeled acoustic, unplugged, or unwired, the assumption seems to be that other types of music are ''cluttered'' by [[Audio technology|technology]] and [[Overproduction (music)|overproduction]] and therefore aren't as ''pure''.\"",
