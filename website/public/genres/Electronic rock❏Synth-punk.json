  "description": "'''Synth-punk''' (originally '''techno-punk''' or '''electropunk''') is a style of electronic music that mixes the aggression of [[punk rock]] with the use of synthesizers. Originally pioneered by New York band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], formed in 1970. Their sound over their five studio albums mixed punk rock with various electronic-based genres such as electronic rock, [[synth-pop]], and [[disco]]. Other artists such as Californian band [[the Screamers]] were labeled \"techno-punk\" by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1978. Rather than the usual electric guitars, the band's instrumentation included a heavily distorted [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] and an [[ARP Odyssey]] [[synthesizer]]. The term synth-punk (or electropunk) was coined in 1999 by Damien Ramsey.\n\nIn the early 1980s, synth-punk fused with various electronic genres to create [[electronic body music]], which would influence a number of subsequent [[industrial dance]], industrial rock and industrial metal acts. It also influenced the [[hardcore punk]] inspired [[digital hardcore]], which combines hardcore punk with electronic music, [[Noise music|noise]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. It typically features fast tempos and aggressive [[Sampling (music)|sound samples]].\n\nLater revival instances include electronic body music, dance punk, and electroclash. In the 2010s, synth-punk influenced the development of an internet microgenre known as [[egg punk]] which drew influence from Devo.",
