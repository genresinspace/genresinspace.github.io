  "description": "'''Symphonic metal''' is a cross-genre style designation for the symphonic subsets of [[heavy metal music]] subgenres. It is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements. The style features the heavy drums and guitars of metal with different elements of [[orchestra]]l [[classical music]], such as symphonic instruments, choirs and sometimes a full orchestra, or just keyboard orchestration.\n\nSymphonic metal bands can feature classically trained vocalists, in which case they can be attributed nicknames such as '''opera metal''' or '''operatic metal'''. Perhaps the most prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Swedish band [[Therion (band)|Therion]], Finnish band [[Nightwish]], German band [[Xandria]], Italian band [[Rhapsody of Fire]], American bands [[Lorna Shore]] and [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]], and Dutch bands [[Epica (band)|Epica]] and [[Within Temptation]]. Those bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in [[film score]]s in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. Many people who participate in this genre of metal music have a degree in musical thought or have been taught how to sing in a classical style.",
