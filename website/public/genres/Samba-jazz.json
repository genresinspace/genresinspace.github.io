  "description": "'''Samba-jazz''' or '''jazz samba''' is an instrumental subgenre of [[samba]] that emerged in the [[bossa nova]] ambit in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Brazil.{{sfn|Silva|2017|pp=91, 94}}{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=268}}\n\nThe style consolidated the approach of Brazilian samba with American [[jazz]],{{sfn|Silva|2017|p=94}} especially [[bebop]] and [[hard bop]], jazzy styles quite experienced by Brazilian musicians in scope of [[gafieira]]s and nightclubs especially in [[Rio de Janeiro]].{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=268}}{{sfn|Silva|2017|p=92}} Having its initial formation based on the piano, the double bass and the drums, samba-jazz gradually absorbed broader musical instruments.{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=268}}\n\nUnlike bossa nova, which is a style of samba characterized by its intimate spirit, soft sound and the restraint of sound elements, samba-jazz has many elements present in improvising and stridency.{{sfn|Barsalini|2014|p=7}} Nevertheless as bossa nova became well known, samba-jazz itself was favored by the bossa-novista repertoire,{{sfn|Silva|2017|pp=92, 95}} and a whole generation of instrumentalists influenced by American jazz, such as [[Sérgio Mendes]], [[J. T. Meirelles|J.T. Meirelles]], [[Edison Machado]], [[Dom Um Romão]], [[Zimbo Trio]], [[Tamba Trio]], [[Milton Banana Trio]], [[Jongo Trio]], among others, became involved with the style led by [[João Gilberto]].{{sfn|Silva|2017|p=98}}",
