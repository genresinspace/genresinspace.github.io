  "description": "'''Psychedelic trance''', '''psytrance''', or '''psy''' is a subgenre of [[trance music]] characterized by arrangements of [[rhythm]]s and layered [[melodies]] created by high tempo [[riff]]s. The genre offers variety in terms of mood, tempo, and style. Some examples include full on, [[dark psytrance|darkpsy]], forest, minimal (Zenonesque), hitech psy, progressive, [[Suomisaundi|suomi]], psy-chill, psycore (fusion of psychedelic trance and [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]]), psybient (fusion of psychedelic trance and ambient), psybreaks, or \"adapted\" tracks from other music genres. [[Goa trance]] preceded psytrance; when digital media became more commonly used, psytrance evolved. Goa continues to develop alongside the other genres.",
