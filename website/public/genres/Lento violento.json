  "description": "'''Lento violento''', sometimes shortened to simply '''lento''', is a style of  [[electronic dance music]] that developed in Italy. Its name means ''slow (and) violent''. Lento Violento is characterized by minimal, slow-feeling rhythmic structures and aggressive sound design, not by a fixed low BPM range. It consists of a hard [[Bass drum|kick]], like the ones present in [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]] or [[hardstyle]], but played at a very slow tempo, with vocal samples and dark and acid sounds or loops.",
