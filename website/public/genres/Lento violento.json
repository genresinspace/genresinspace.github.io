  "description": "'''Lento violento''', sometimes shortened to simply '''lento''', is a style of  [[electronic dance music]] that developed in Italy. Its name means ''slow (and) violent'', as this style typically has a [[tempo]] between 85 and 115 beats per minute (BPM). It consists of a hard [[Bass drum|kick]], like the ones present in [[Hardcore techno|hardcore]] or [[hardstyle]], but played at a very slow tempo, with vocal samples and dark and acid sounds or loops."
