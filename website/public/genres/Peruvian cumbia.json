  "description": "'''Peruvian cumbia''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''''Cumbia Peruana''''') is a subgenre of cumbia that became popular in the coastal cities of [[Peru]], mainly in [[Lima]] in the 1960s through the fusion of local versions of the original [[Cumbia (Colombia)|Colombian genre]], traditional highland [[huayno]], and elements of traditional rhythms from the [[Coast of Peru|coast]], [[Sierra del Per√∫|highlands]], and the [[Peruvian Amazonia|jungle]] of [[Peru]], and [[Rock music]], particularly [[Rock and roll|Rock & roll]], [[Surf rock]] and [[Psychedelic rock]]. \n\nUnlike other styles of cumbia, the chicha subgenre's harmonics are based on the [[pentatonic scale]] typical of [[Andean music]]. It is played with keyboards or synthesizers and up to three electric guitars that can play simultaneous melodies, an element derived from the harp and guitar lines of Andean huayno. The rhythmic electric guitar in chicha is played with upstrokes, following patterns derived from Peruvian coastal [[Peruvian waltz|creole waltz]]. Chicha songs contain electric guitar solos, following the rock music tradition.",
