  "description": "'''Zhongguo feng''' or '''Chinese style''' ({{zh|p=Zhōngguó fēng|t=中國風|s=中国风}}) music is a popular Chinese [[music]] genre considered to adopt a more traditional musical style in its instrumental than normal popular music, similar to [[Chinese traditional music]] but with a \"Modern Twist\" style way. Following the success of Taiwanese singer [[Jay Chou]]'s early works including \"Wife\" ({{Lang-zh|c=娘子|labels=no}}) and \"East Wind Breaks\" ({{Lang-zh|t=東風破|labels=no}}), it emerged in the popular music scene in early 2000s.\n\nThis music style is different from traditional Chinese folk music and Chinese classical music in that, ''Zhongguo feng'' pop music is essentially contemporary pop music but with more Chinese elements in its arrangement and references.\n\nThe [[Gufeng music]] is similar but slightly different from Zhongguo feng music.",
