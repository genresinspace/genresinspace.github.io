  "description": "'''Western swing, country jazz''' or '''smooth country''' is a subgenre of American [[country music]] that originated in the late 1920s in the [[Western United States|West]] and [[Southern United States|South]] among the region's [[Western music (North America)|Western]] [[string band]]s. It is dance music, often with an up-tempo beat, which attracted huge crowds to dance halls and clubs in [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[California]] during the 1930s and 1940s until a federal war-time nightclub tax in 1944 contributed to the genre's decline.\n\nThe movement was an outgrowth of [[jazz]]. The music is an amalgamation of [[American roots music|rural]], [[Western music (North America)|cowboy]], [[polka]], [[Old-time music|old-time]], [[Dixieland jazz]], and [[blues]] blended with [[swing music|swing]]; and played by a [[Musical improvisation|hot]] string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the [[steel guitar]]. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included overtones of [[bebop]].\n\nWestern swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven [[Big band|big swing bands]] of the same era. In Western bands, even fully orchestrated bands, vocals, and other instruments followed the fiddle's lead, though like popular horn-led bands that arranged and scored their music, most Western bands improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively.\n\nAccording to country singer [[Merle Travis]], \"Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my friend, you have Western swing.\"",
