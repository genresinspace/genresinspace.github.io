  "description": "'''Western swing''', also known as '''country jazz''', is a subgenre of traditional  [[country music]].\n\nThe movement was an outgrowth of country music and [[jazz]]. The music is an amalgamation of [[American roots music|rural]], [[Western music (North America)|cowboy]], [[polka]], early [[Honky-tonk|Honky Tonk]], [[Old-time music|old-time]], [[Dixieland jazz]], and [[blues]] blended with [[swing music|swing]]; and played by a [[Musical improvisation|hot]] string band of fiddles, mandolin, upright bass, electric and acoustic guitars, banjos, and often augmented with drums, saxophones, trumpets, trombones, pianos, accordion and most notably, the [[steel guitar]]. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound.\n\nWestern swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven [[Big band|big swing bands]] of the same era. In Western bands, even fully orchestrated bands, vocals, and other instruments followed the fiddle's lead, though like popular horn-led bands that arranged and scored their music, most Western bands improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively.\n\nAccording to country singer [[Merle Travis]], \"Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my friend, you have Western swing.\"",
