  "description": "'''Progressive metal''' (often shortened to '''prog metal''') is a broad fusion music genre melding [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]], combining the loud aggression and amplified distorted [[electric guitar|guitar]]-driven sound of the former with the more experimental, cerebral or quasi-classical compositions of the latter.\n\nThe music typically showcases the extreme technical proficiency of the performers and usually uses unorthodox [[Chord progression|harmonies]] as well as complex rhythms with frequent [[Metre (music)|meter]] changes and intense [[syncopation]]. The polyrhythmic aspects are especially emphasized in the [[djent]] subgenre. \n \nAlthough the genre emerged towards the late-1980s, it was not until the 1990s that progressive metal achieved widespread success. [[Dream Theater]], [[Watchtower (band)|Watchtower]], [[Queensrÿche]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[Symphony X]], [[Shadow Gallery]], [[King's X]], [[Fates Warning]], and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] are a few examples of progressive metal bands who achieved commercial success.",
