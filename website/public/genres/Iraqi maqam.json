  "description": "'''Iraqi Maqam''' ({{langx|ar|المقام العراقي|al-maqām al-ʿIrāqī}}) is a [[musical genre|genre]] of [[Arabic maqam]] music found in [[Iraq]]. The roots of modern [[Maqam al-iraqi|Iraqi maqam]] can be traced as far back as the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (8th–13th centuries AD), when that large empire was controlled from [[Baghdad]]. The ensemble of instruments used in this genre, called ''Al Chalghi al Baghdadi'', includes a ''qari' ''(singer), ''[[Iraqi Santur|santur]]'', [[goblet drum]], joza, ''cello,'' and sometimes ''[[oud]]'' and [[Naqareh|naqqarat]]. The focus is on the poem sung in classical Arabic or an Iraqi dialect (then called ''zuhayri''). A complete maqam concert is known as ''fasl'' (plural ''fusul'') and is named after the first maqam: [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayat]], Hijaz, [[Rast (maqam)|Rast]], Nawa, or Husayni.\n\nA typical performance includes the following sections:\n*''tahrir'', sometimes ''badwah''\n*''taslum''\n*''finalis''\n[[Maqama]] texts are often derived from classical [[Arabic poetry]], such as by [[al-Mutanabbi]] and [[Abu Nuwas]]. Some performers used traditional sources translated into the dialect of Baghdad, and still others use Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Armenian, Hebrew, Turkmen, Aramaic lyrics. Due to Iraq's diversity, different ethnic groups use this genre in their own language.",
