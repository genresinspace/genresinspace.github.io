  "description": "'''Outlaw country''' is a subgenre of American [[country music]] created by a small group of artists active in the 1970s and early 1980s, known collectively as the '''outlaw movement''', who fought for and won their creative freedom outside of the [[Music Row|Nashville establishment]] that dictated the sound of most country music of the era. [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] were among the movement's most commercially successful members.\n\nThe music has its roots in earlier subgenres like [[Western music (North America)|Western]], [[Honky-tonk|honky tonk]], [[rockabilly]], and [[progressive country]], and is characterized by a blend of rock and [[Folk music|folk]] rhythms, country instrumentation, and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and limiting structures of the [[Nashville sound]] developed by [[Chet Atkins]] and other record producers.",
