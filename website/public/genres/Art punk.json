  "description": "'''Art punk''', or '''artcore''', is a subgenre of [[punk rock]] in which artists go beyond the genre's rudimentary [[garage rock]] and are considered more sophisticated than their peers.{{sfn|Gittins|2004|p=5}} These groups still generated punk's aesthetic of being simple, offensive, and free-spirited, but essentially attracted audiences other than the angry, working-class ones that surrounded [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]]."
