  "description": "'''Art punk''' (also known as '''avant-punk''' or '''experimental punk''') is a subgenre of [[punk rock]] influenced by [[art school]] culture in which artists go beyond the genre's rudimentary [[Three-chord song|three-chord]] [[garage rock]] conventions, incorporating more complex song structures, esoteric influences and a more sophisticated sound and image.{{sfn|Gittins|2004|p=5}} While retaining punk's simplicity and rawness, art punk draws more from [[avant-garde music]], literature and abstract art than other punk subgenres, often intersecting with the more experimental branches of the [[post-punk]] scene. Subsequently, attracting opposing audiences to that of the angry, working-class ones that surrounded the original [[punk rock]] scene.",
