  "description": "'''Black metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], a [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieking]] vocal style, heavily distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], raw ([[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]) recording, unconventional [[song structure]]s, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in [[corpse paint]] and adopt [[pseudonym]]s.\n\n[[Venom (band)|Venom]] initiated the \"[[First-wave black metal|first wave]]\" of black metal, with their 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' giving it its name. In the following years, the style was developed by [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]]. By 1987, this wave had declined, but influential works were released by [[Tormentor (band)|Tormentor]], [[Sarcófago]], [[Parabellum (Colombian band)|Parabellum]], [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]], [[Samael (band)|Samael]] and [[Rotting Christ]]. A \"[[Second-wave black metal|second wave]]\" arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by bands in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]], such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Emperor (Norwegian band)|Emperor]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]] and [[Gorgoroth]]. This Norwegian scene did much to define black metal as a distinct genre, and inspired other scenes in Finland ([[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]], [[Impaled Nazarene]]); Sweden ([[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Abruptum]], [[Nifelheim]]); the United States ([[Profanatica]], [[Demoncy]], [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]], [[Grand Belial's Key]]); France ([[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]]); as well as leading to the founding of influential bands in other countries, including [[Sigh (band)|Sigh]] and [[Cradle of Filth]].\n\nBlack metal has often sparked controversy. Common themes in the genre are [[misanthropy]], [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christianity]], [[Satanism]], and [[Ethnic religion|ethnic]] [[Modern paganism|paganism]]. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of [[#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murders. There is also a small [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[National Socialist black metal|movement]] within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to remain an [[Underground music|underground]] phenomenon.",
