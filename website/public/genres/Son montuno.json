  "description": "'''Son montuno''' is a subgenre of [[son cubano]] developed by [[Arsenio Rodríguez]] in the 1940s. Although ''son montuno'' (\"mountain sound\") had previously referred to the ''sones'' played in the mountains of eastern Cuba, Arsenio repurposed the term to denote a highly sophisticated approach to the genre in which the [[montuno]] section contained complex [[horn section|horn]] arrangements. He also incorporated piano solos and often subverted the structure of songs by starting with the montuno in a cyclic fashion. For his approach, Arsenio had to expand the existing ''septeto'' ensemble into the ''[[conjunto]]'' format which became the norm in the 1940s alongside [[big band]]s. Arsenio's developments eventually served as the template for the development of genres such as [[salsa music|salsa]], [[songo music|songo]] and [[timba]].",
