  "description": "'''Mobb music''' is a subgenre of hip-hop that emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly in the 1990s, and is characterized by its slow, bass-heavy beats, deep storytelling, and gritty street narratives. It is closely associated with Bay Area hip-hop culture, which has influenced various hip-hop movements, including the '''hyphy''' era of the mid-2000s. Pioneering artists like [[Too Short]],  [[E-40]] and [[Mac Mall]] were instrumental in shaping the genre, with notable albums such as [[Too Short|Too $hort]]'s [[Short Dog's in the House]] (1990), [[Mac Mall]]'s [[Illegal Business?]] (1993), [[E-40]]'s [[In a Major Way]] (1995). Mobb Music laid the foundation for later Bay Area movements like [[Hyphy]], influencing the region's [[hip-hop]] sound and [[culture]]."
