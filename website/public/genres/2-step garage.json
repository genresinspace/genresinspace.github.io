  "description": "'''2-step garage''', or simply '''2-step''', is a genre of [[electronic music]] and a subgenre of [[UK garage]]. One of the primary characteristics of the 2-step sound – the term being coined to describe \"a general rubric for all kinds of jittery, irregular rhythms that don't conform to garage's traditional [[four-on-the-floor]] pulse\" – is that the [[rhythm]] lacks the [[kick drum]] pattern found in many other styles of electronic music with a regular [[four-on-the-floor]] beat.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}",
