  "description": "'''Melodic death metal''' (also referred to as '''melodeath''') is a subgenre of [[death metal]] that employs highly melodic guitar [[riff]]s, often borrowing from traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] (including [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]]). The genre features the heaviness of death metal but with highly melodic or harmonized guitar riffs and solos, and often features high-pitched shrieked vocals (differing from traditional death metal) alongside the low-pitched growls commonly featured in traditional death metal. Pioneered by the English heavy metal band [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] with their 1993 album ''[[Heartwork]]'', melodic death metal developed further in Sweden (developed by bands like [[At the Gates]], [[Dark Tranquillity]], and [[In Flames]]) in the mid-1990s. The [[Swedish death metal]] scene did much to popularise the style, soon centering in the \"[[Swedish death metal#Gothenburg scene|Gothenburg metal]]\" scene. At the Gates' ''[[Slaughter of the Soul]]'', Dark Tranquillity's ''[[The Gallery (album)|The Gallery]]'', and In Flames' ''[[The Jester Race]]'', all released in the mid-1990s, were highly influential albums in melodic death metal, with At the Gates and In Flames being the two most common influences on North American 2000s heavy metal bands. Many American heavy metal bands emulated At the Gates' sound, resulting in the usage of the phrase \"At the Gates worship\".\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, many melodic death metal bands emerged, including [[Children of Bodom]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Insomnium]], and [[Soilwork]]. In the 2000s decade, melodic death metal achieved popularity among heavy metal fans, starting with the release of In Flames' 2002 album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'', which showed a change to a more eclectic sound while retaining the band's melodic death metal sound. Many other melodic death metal bands quickly had chart success.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, [[melodic metalcore]], a subgenre of [[metalcore]] that combines the genre with melodic death metal, achieved popularity with the chart success and sales success of bands like [[Killswitch Engage]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], and [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]]. [[Deathcore]] bands during this time period like [[Bring Me the Horizon]] and [[Through the Eyes of the Dead]] also were influenced by melodic death metal and achieved popularity.",
