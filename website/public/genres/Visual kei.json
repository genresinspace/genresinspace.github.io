Koji Dejima of ''[[Bounce (magazine)|Bounce]]'' wrote that visual kei is not a specific sound, but rather it \"revolves around the creation of a band's unique worldview and/or stylistic beauty through visual expressions in the form of makeup and fashion\". While visual kei acts can be of any music genre, it originated with bands influenced by [[glam rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]] and [[gothic rock]].\n\nVisual kei was pioneered by groups such as [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]], [[Buck-Tick]], [[D'erlanger]], and [[Color (band)|Color]], and gained further notoriety in the 1990s through the success of groups like [[Luna Sea]], [[Glay]], [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], and [[Malice Mizer]]. The movement's success continued through the 2000s with [[Gackt]] and more musically broad bands such as [[Dir En Grey]], [[The Gazette (band)|the Gazette]], [[Alice Nine]], and [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]], a period which some critics term {{nihongo|\"neo-visual kei\"|ネオ・ヴィジュアル系}}. Many acts tone-down their appearance upon achieving mainstream success, calling into question whether they are still to be considered visual kei.",
