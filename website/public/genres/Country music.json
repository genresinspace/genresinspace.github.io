  "description": "'''Country''' (also called '''country and western''') is a [[popular music|music genre]] originating in the southern regions of the United States, both the [[American South]] and [[American southwest|the Southwest]]. First produced in the 1920s, country music is primarily focused on singing [[Narrative|stories]] about [[Working class in the United States|working-class]] and [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] American life.\n\nCountry music is known for its [[ballad]]s and dance tunes (i.e., \"[[Honky-tonk#Music|honky-tonk music]]\") with simple form, folk lyrics, and harmonies generally accompanied by instruments such as [[banjo]]s, [[fiddle]]s, [[harmonica]]s, and many types of [[guitar]] (including [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]], [[electric guitar|electric]], [[steel guitar|steel]], and [[resonator guitar|resonator]] guitars). Though it is primarily rooted in various forms of [[American folk music]], such as [[old-time music]] and [[Appalachian music]], many other traditions, including [[African-American music|African-American]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican]], [[Music of Ireland|Irish]], and [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian music]], have had a formative influence on the genre. [[Jazz scale#Blues scale|Blues modes]] from [[blues music]] have been used extensively throughout its history as well.\n\nOnce called \"[[hillbilly]] music\", the term ''country music'' gained [[popularity]] in the 1940s. The genre came to encompass [[Western music (North America)|western music]], which evolved parallel to “hillbilly music” from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. Contemporary styles of western music include [[Texas country]], [[Red dirt (music)|red dirt]], and Hispano- and [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]]-led [[Tejano music|Tejano]] and [[New Mexico music]], which still exists alongside longstanding [[Indigenous music of North America#Southwest|indigenous traditions]].\n\nIn 2009, in the United States, country music was the most-listened-to rush-hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second-most popular in the morning commute.",
