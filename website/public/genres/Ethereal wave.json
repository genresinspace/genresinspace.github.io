  "description": "'''Ethereal wave''', also called '''ethereal darkwave''', '''ethereal goth''' or simply '''ethereal''', is a [[subgenre]] of [[dark wave]] music that is variously described as \"gothic\", \"romantic\", and \"otherworldly\". It developed in the early 1980s in the United Kingdom as an outgrowth of [[gothic rock]], and was mainly represented by [[4AD]] bands such as [[Cocteau Twins]], [[This Mortal Coil]], and early guitar-driven [[Dead Can Dance]].\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, the genre continued to develop in the United States and was primarily associated with C'est La Mort Records, which featured artists such as Area (later [[Henry Frayne (musician)|the Moon Seven Times]]) and [[Heavenly Bodies (band)|Heavenly Bodies]], a band formed by ex-members of Dead Can Dance and This Mortal Coil, as well as with [[Projekt Records]], which featured groups like [[Black Tape for a Blue Girl]], [[Love Spirals Downwards]] and [[Lycia (band)|Lycia]].\n\nEthereal wave, especially the music of Cocteau Twins, was one of the key inspirations for the British [[dream pop]]/[[shoegaze]] scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
