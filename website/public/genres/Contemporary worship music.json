  "description": "'''Contemporary worship music''' ('''CWM'''), also known as '''praise and worship music''', is a distinct genre of [[Christian music]] used in [[contemporary worship]]. It has evolved over the past 60 years and is stylistically similar to [[pop music]]. The songs are often referred to as \"praise songs\" or \"worship songs\" and are typically led by a \"worship band\" or \"praise team,\" with either a guitarist or pianist serving as the lead. It has become a common genre of music performed in many churches, particularly in charismatic or non-denominational Protestant churches, with some [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] congregations also incorporating it into the Mass.",
