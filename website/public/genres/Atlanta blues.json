  "description": "'''Atlanta blues''' refers to the local [[blues]] scene in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, United States, which had its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s. According to [[AllMusic]], \"The Atlanta blues scene of the 1920s was among the most fertile in all the South, with a steady stream of rural musicians converging on the city hoping to gain exposure playing the local club circuit, with any luck rising to perform at [[Decatur Street (Atlanta)|Decatur Street]]'s famed 81 Theatre\".\n\nThe oldest representative of the Atlanta blues was [[Peg Leg Howell]], who made his first recordings in 1926. He was followed by [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Barbecue Bob]], [[Charley Lincoln]], and [[Curley Weaver]], with McTell typically being the most popular and acclaimed.{{citation needed|date=August 2025}} Many of these musicians banded together into groups; the most popular of these bands were the Georgia Cotton Pickers.\n\n[[Cora Mae Bryant]], the daughter of Curley Weaver, gradually became important on the Atlanta blues scene; performing, organizing \"Giving It Back\" festivals at the city's Northside Tavern to honor early blues artists, and as a frequent caller to local blues radio shows. Also, Bryant's knowledge of early blues in Atlanta and Georgia was used as a source by the music historians [[Peter B. Lowry]] and [[Bruce Bastin]].",
