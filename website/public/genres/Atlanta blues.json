  "description": "'''Atlanta blues''' refers to the local [[blues]] scene in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, United States, which had its heyday in the 1920s and 1930s. According to [[AllMusic]],\"The Atlanta blues scene of the 1920s was among the most fertile in all the South, with a steady stream of rural musicians converging on the city hoping to gain exposure playing the local club circuit, with any luck rising to perform at Decatur Street's famed 81 Theatre.\"\n\nThe oldest representative of the Atlanta blues was [[Peg Leg Howell]], who made his first recordings in 1926. He was followed by [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Barbecue Bob]], [[Charley Lincoln]], and [[Curley Weaver]], with McTell typically being the most popular and acclaimed. Many of these musicians banded together into groups; the most popular of these bands were the [[Georgia Cotton Pickers]].\n\n[[Cora Mae Bryant]], the daughter of Curley Weaver, gradually became important on the Atlanta blues scene; performing, organizing \"Giving It Back\" festivals at the city's Northside Tavern to honor early blues artists, and as a frequent caller to local blues radio shows. Also, Bryant's knowledge of early blues in Atlanta and Georgia was used as a source by the music historians [[Peter B. Lowry]] and [[Bruce Bastin]].\n\nMore modern blues performers who have come out of or near Atlanta include [[Baby Tate (guitarist)|Baby Tate]], \n[[Precious Bryant]], [[Beverly Watkins]], [[Albert White (musician)|Albert White]], [[Eddie Tigner]], [[Robert Cray]], [[Jesse Fuller]], [[Jontavious Willis]], and [[Chick Willis]].",
