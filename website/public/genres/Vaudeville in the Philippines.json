  "description": "'''Vaudeville in the Philippines''', more commonly referred in the Filipino vernacular as '''''bodabil''''', was a popular genre of entertainment in the [[Philippines]] from the 1910s until the mid-1960s. For decades, it competed with film, radio and television as the dominant form of Filipino mass entertainment. It peaked in popularity during the Japanese occupation in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945. Many of the leading figures of [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine film]] in the 20th century, such as [[Dolphy]], [[Nora Aunor]], [[Leopoldo Salcedo]] and [[Rogelio de la Rosa]], began their showbusiness careers in ''bodabil''.\n\n''Bodabil'' is an indigenized form of  [[vaudeville]], introduced in the Philippines around the turn of the 20th century. It featured a hodgepodge of musical numbers, short-form comedy and dramatic skits, and even magic acts, often staged inside the [[Standalone movie theaters of the Philippines|theaters of Manila]]. ''Bodabil'' proved the vehicle for the popularization of musical trends and musicians, performance genres and performers.",
