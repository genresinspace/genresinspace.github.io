  "description": "'''Nu gaze''' (sometimes called '''newgaze''') is a form of [[alternative rock]] that originated in the 2000s that is directly influenced by the primarily British [[shoegazing|shoegaze]] scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. A renewed interest in shoegaze occurred in the early 2000s when bands such as [[Maps (band)|Maps]], [[My Vitriol]], [[Silversun Pickups]], and [[The Radio Dept.]] first emerged across both sides of the Atlantic. The origin of the moniker \"nu gaze\" has been credited to an interview in 2001 with My Vitriol frontman Som Wardner about the band's music.\n\nAccording to an article in ''[[The Oxford Student]]'', music from the genre features \"droning riffs, subdued vocals and walls of distorted, messy guitar or synth\".\n\nThe shoegaze revival draws inspiration heavily from shoegaze but incorporates more modern synthesizers and drum tracks. Starting in the early 2020s, newer bands started to blend shoegaze with nu metal, grunge, post-punk & noise rock influences.{{cn|date=August 2025}}",
