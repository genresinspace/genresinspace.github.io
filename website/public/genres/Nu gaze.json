  "description": "'''Nu gaze''' or '''nu-gaze''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[alternative rock]] music that originated in the early to mid-[[2000s in music|2000s]]. It's style is derived from the [[shoegazing|shoegaze]] genre of the late 1980s and early 1990s. A renewed interest in shoegaze occurred in the early 2000s when bands such as, [[Maps (band)|Maps]], [[My Vitriol]], [[Silversun Pickups]], and [[The Radio Dept.]] gained popularity. The term \"nu gaze\" or \"nu-gaze\" was first notably stated in a 2001 interview by Som Wardner of My Vitriol, when asked to describe the band's musical style.\n\nAccording to an article in ''[[The Oxford Student]]'', music from the genre features \"droning riffs, subdued vocals and walls of distorted, messy guitar or synth\".\n\nThe nu gaze revival draws inspiration heavily from shoegaze but incorporates more modern synthesizers and drum tracks. Starting in the early to mid-2010s, bands such as [[Whirr]], [[Nothing (band)|Nothing]], [[Glare (band)|Glare]], and [[Wisp (musician)|Wisp]] have paved way for the subgenre's popularity with their blend of shoegaze with nu metal, grunge, post-punk and noise rock influences.",
