It is a form of [[Eurodisco]] and a popular strand of the late 1990s and 2000s European dance music scene. The defining characteristics of the genre are [[Audio filter|filter]] and [[Phaser (effect)|phaser]] effects both on and alongside [[Sample (music)|samples]] from late 1970s and early 1980s European [[disco]] tracks. Tracks sometimes contained original [[Hook (music)|hooks]] inspired by these samples, providing thicker harmonic foundations than the genre's forerunners. Most tracks in this style are in [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}}]] time and feature steady [[Four on the floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beats in the tempo range of 110–130 [[beats per minute]]. Purveyors of French house include [[Daft Punk]], [[David Guetta]], [[Bob Sinclar]], [[Martin Solveig]], [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]], [[The Supermen Lovers]], [[Modjo]], [[Justice (band)|Justice]], [[Air (French band)|Air]], and [[Étienne de Crécy]].",
