  "description": "'''Nerdcore''' is a genre of [[hip hop music]] characterized by subject matter considered of interest to [[nerd]]s and [[geek]]s.  Self-described nerdcore musician [[MC Frontalot]] has the earliest known recorded use of the term (to describe this genre) in the 2000 song \"Nerdcore Hiphop\". As a niche genre similar to [[punk rock]], nerdcore generally holds to the [[DIY ethic]], and has a history of self-publishing and self-production.\n\nThough nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction, there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter such as [[anime]], [[film|movie]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, science, [[high fantasy|fantasy]], computers and [[video game]]s.",
