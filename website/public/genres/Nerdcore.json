  "description": "'''Nerdcore''' is a genre of [[hip hop music]] characterized by subject matter considered of interest to [[nerd]]s and [[geek]]s.  Self-described nerdcore musician [[MC Frontalot]] has the earliest known recorded use of the term (to describe this genre) in the 2000 song \"Nerdcore Hiphop\". Frontalot, like most nerdcore artists, self-publishes his work and has released much of it for free online. As a niche genre, nerdcore generally holds to the [[DIY ethic]], and has a history of self-publishing and self-production.\n\nThough nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction, there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter, including [[anime]], ''[[movies]]'', [[role-playing games]], science, [[high fantasy|fantasy]] and computers."
