  "description": "'''Brutal death metal''' is a subgenre of [[death metal]] that privileges heaviness, speed and complex rhythms over other aspects, such as melody and timbres. The genre was pioneered in the early 1990s by [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]] and other groups from [[New York (state)|New York]] including [[Mortician (band)|Mortician]], [[Skinless]] and [[Malignancy (band)|Malignancy]]. Its subgenre slam death metal quickly developed, played by [[Internal Bleeding (band)|Internal Bleeding]], [[Devourment]] and [[Cephalotripsy (band)|Cephalotripsy]], putting a greater emphasis on the genre's mid-tempo, groove sections and [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdown]]s. During the mid–1990s, a prominent wave of groups emphasising the genre's more technical aspects developed with [[Cryptopsy]], [[Nile (band)|Nile]], [[Origin (band)|Origin]] and [[Dying Fetus]]. During the mid–2000s, there was a revived interest in brutal death metal and slam, a period which produced [[Katalepsy]] and [[Ingested (band)|Ingested]], and saw groups lean into cleaner production styles.",
