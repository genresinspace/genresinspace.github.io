  "description": "'''Australian hip-hop''' traces its origins to the early 1980s and was initially largely inspired by [[hip-hop]] and other urban musical genres from the United States. As the form matured, Australian hip hop has become a commercially viable style of music that is no longer restricted to the creative underground, with artists such as [[Onefour]], [[Hilltop Hoods]], [[Kerser]] and [[Bliss n Eso]] and having achieved notable fame. Australian Hip-Hop is still primarily released through [[independent record label]]s, which are often owned and operated by the artists themselves. Despite its genesis as an offshoot of American hip-hop, Australian hip hop has developed a distinct personality that reflects its evolution as an Australian musical style. Since the inception of the Australian hip-hop scene, [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aboriginals]] have played a prominent role.",
