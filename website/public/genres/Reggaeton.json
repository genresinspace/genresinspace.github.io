It has evolved from [[dancehall]], with elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Latin American music|Latin American]], and [[Caribbean music]].

Seemingly endless artists from the Caribbean have risen to fame ([[Puerto Rico]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]]). [[Argentina]] has seen a modern surge in young artists inspired by the reggaetón style, fusing their music with Spanish rap verses, [[Latin trap|trapetón]] and R&B-style vocals (such as the \"Los Del Espacio\", including [[LIT killah]], [[Tiago PZK]], [[Duki (rapper)|Duki]], [[Emilia Mernes|Emilia]], and [[María Becerra]], as well as Argentine pop star [[Tini Stoessel|Tini]]).\n\nSeveral established, world-famous performers—notably Puerto Rican-American [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Shakira]] from Colombia—have embraced the style, recording numerous duets and collaborations with top ''reggaetoneros''. Several other emerging international artists are seeing success in the genre as well, including [[Catalans|Catalán]]-[[Castilian people|Spanish]] singer [[Bad Gyal]] (from [[Barcelona]]) and [[trilingual]] Brazilian star [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]] (from [[Rio de Janeiro]]). Mexican-American singer [[Becky G]] (from [[Los Angeles, California]]) has experienced huge success in recent years, as a [[Latino American]] artist in the reggaetón genre. In 2004, [[Daddy Yankee]] released his smash single “[[Gasolina]]”, regarded by many as the first globally-successful reggaetón song; Daddy Yankee is credited with bringing the style to western pop music listeners.
