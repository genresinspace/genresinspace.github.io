  "description": "The '''West Side Sound''' (or '''Westside Sound''') is a musical scene and regional subgenre of [[Brown-eyed soul|Chicano soul]] that emerged in [[San Antonio]], Texas, United States, and South-Central Texas more broadly, in the 1940s and 1950s. The name ''West Side Sound'' comes from the West Side neighbourhood of San Antonio, though the genre did not originate there. It is also not a singular, easily defined sound.\n\nThe West Side Sound helped lay the foundations for the broader Chicano soul (or ''brown-eyed soul'') genre, drawing on disparate styles such as [[blues]], rhythm and blues, [[rock and roll]], [[Country music|country]], and the music of Mexican [[conjunto]] ensembles, among others.",
