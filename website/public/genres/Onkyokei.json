  "description": "The '''Onkyo music movement''' or {{Nihongo|'''Onkyokei'''|音響系|Onkyōkei}} (translation: \"reverberation of sound\") is a form of [[free improvisation]], emerging from Japan in the late 1990s. Onkyō can be translated as \"sound, noise, echo\". Some artists commonly associated with Onkyō include [[Toshimaru Nakamura]], [[Tetuzi Akiyama]], [[Sachiko M]], and [[Taku Sugimoto]], among others.\n\nThe Off Site, a venue in Tokyo, is home to the Onkyo music movement, which is characterized by improvisation, [[minimalist music|minimalism]], and \"quiet [[noise (music)|noise]]\". Onkyo improvisation, \"explores the fine-grained [[texture (music)|textural]] details of [[acoustic music|acoustic]] and [[electronic music|electronic]] sound\".\n\nIt influenced the development of [[electroacoustic improvisation]], or EAI, a genre with which it is strongly intertwined. The transnational circulation of onkyo also influenced its representation as a form of \"Japanese new music,\" despite claims by its authors that onkyo had little to do with Japanese cultural identity.",
