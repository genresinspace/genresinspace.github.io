  "description": "'''Big room house''' or simply '''big room''' is a fusion subgenre of [[house music]] (notably [[progressive house]] and [[electro house]]) that gained popularity in the early 2010s. Although the term \"big room\" started appearing in news articles circa 2007, the current state of this subgenre emerged around 2010—12 and was popularized by songs such as \"[[Epic (Sandro Silva and Quintino song)|Epic]]\" and \"[[Cannonball (Showtek and Justin Prime song)|Cannonball]]\". From 2013 on, artists like [[Martin Garrix]], [[KSHMR]], [[Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike]], [[Hardwell]], [[Blasterjaxx]], [[W&W]], [[R3HAB]] and others began experimenting with this sound in their compositions.\n\nThe genre is generally set at a tempo that falls between 126 and 132 [[Beats per minute|BPM]]. Songs typically include long buildups followed by an electro-style [[Drop (music)|drop]] accompanied by the [[Four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] kick drums typical of house music. Melodies are often simple and minimal, though a [[techno]]-inspired [[Roland JP-8000|supersaw]] is frequently used.",
