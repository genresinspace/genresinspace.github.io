  "description": "'''Big room house''' or simply '''big room''' is a fusion subgenre of [[house music]] (notably [[progressive house]] and [[electro house]]) that gained popularity in the early 2010s. Although the term \"big room\" started appearing in news articles circa 2007, the current state of this subgenre emerged around 2010â€”12 and was popularized by songs such as \"[[Epic (Sandro Silva and Quintino song)|Epic]]\" and \"[[Cannonball (Showtek and Justin Prime song)|Cannonball]]\". From 2013 on, artists like [[Martin Garrix]], [[KSHMR]], [[Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike]], [[Hardwell]], [[Nicky Romero]], [[Afrojack]], and [[R3HAB]] began experimenting with this sound in their compositions.\n\nThe genre is generally set at a tempo that falls between 126 and 132 [[Beats per minute|BPM]]. Songs typically include long buildups followed by an electro-style [[Drop (music)|drop]] accompanied by the [[Four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] kick drums typical of house music. Melodies are often simple and minimal, though a [[Techno]]-inspired [[Roland JP-8000|supersaw]] is frequently used."
