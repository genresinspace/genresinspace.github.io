  "description": "The '''San Francisco sound''' is rock music performed live and recorded by [[San Francisco]]-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the [[counterculture]] community in San Francisco, particularly the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district, during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like [[New York City]] or spread out like [[Los Angeles]]. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other\"\n\nAccording to an announcer for a TV show that [[Ralph J. Gleason]] hosted: \"In his syndicated newspaper column, Mr. Gleason has been the foremost interpreter of the sounds coming out of what he calls 'the Liverpool of the United States.' Mr. Gleason believes the San Francisco rock groups are making a serious contribution to musical history.\" \nRalph Gleason became one of the founders of what would become the rock-scene fan journal, ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.",
