  "description": "Mustard's production style has been described as an up-tempo, radio-friendly, club-oriented, catchy hip hop style which he calls \"ratchet music\". Mustard's body of work has been recognized by critics as sonically cohesive and recognizable in that many of his tracks have recurring, identifiable motifs. Most apparent is his producer signature \"Mustard on that beat, ho!\" which prefaces the beat drop in many of his songs. This signature is often strategically placed to span the third and fourth [[counting (music)|counts]] of the [[bar (music)|measure]] preceding the song's [[drop (music)|drop]] to make it more [[catchiness|catchy]]. On a compositional level, however, Mustard's motifs also include: an ambient chant of \"Hey!\" on the off-beats in the background of his music; the emphasized, minimalist bass synth opening to many songs (most notably on \"[[My Nigga]]\", \"[[R.I.P. (Young Jeezy song)|R.I.P.]]\", and \"[[Rack City]]\"), [[Roland TR-808|808]] kicks and the use of crisp hand-claps and snap-snares.\n\nMustard uses the music production software [[Reason (software)|Reason]], first using 5, 6 and currently using 6.5. In an interview with [[The Fader]] magazine he stated, \"With this ratchet music, I'm trying to create my own sound. I want to make this to where it can't leave, this is something that everybody's gonna get used to. Like how everybody got used to [[Lil Jon]] or Luke. I don't want it to be something that comes and goes, I want it to be something that's here forever like a real culture.\"\n\nAs a result of the recognizably and commonality between many of Mustard's chart-topping singles, a number of artists who employ production similar to DJ Mustard's have been criticized for lack of originality and plagiarism. In a July 2014 interview with [[Tim Westwood]], the rapper [[YG (rapper)|YG]], whose album ''[[My Krazy Life]]'' was mostly produced by Mustard, stated that [[Iggy Azalea]]'s song \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\" 'jocked' Mustard's style.\nLike many of Mustard's songs, the song includes a minimalist [[G-funk]] style synth and samples a layered \"Hey\" voice chant. He has been compared to rap producers like Dr Dre and many old rappers from the golden age of hip hop.",
