  "description": "'''Acid jazz''' (also known as '''club jazz''', '''psychedelic jazz''', or '''groove jazz''') is a [[music genre]] that combines elements of [[funk]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], as well as [[jazz]] and [[disco]]. Acid jazz originated in clubs in London during the 1980s with the [[rare groove]] movement and spread to the United States, Western Europe, Latin America and Japan. Acts included [[The Brand New Heavies]], [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]], [[James Taylor Quartet]], [[Us3]], and [[Jamiroquai]] from the UK, and Guru, [[Buckshot LeFonque]] and [[Digable Planets]] from the U.S. The rise of electronic club music in the middle to late 1990s led to a decline in interest, and in the twenty-first century, acid jazz became indistinct as a genre. Many acts that might have been defined as acid jazz are seen as [[jazz-funk]], or [[nu jazz]]."
