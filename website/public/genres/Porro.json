  "description": "The '''porro''' is a musical style and dance from the [[Caribbean]] region of [[Colombia]]. It is a Colombian [[cumbia]] rhythm that developed into its own subgenre. It was originally a folkloric expression from the [[Sinú River]] area that evolved into a ballroom dance. It is played mostly by brass bands or orchestras, and danced in couples. This genre influenced some of the greatest Latin American bands of the 1960s, with songs such as \"Pachito E'ché\" (originally from Wolfgang Alejandro Tovar García, then interpreted by [[Benny Moré]]), \"[[Se Va el Caimán]]\", and \"Me voy pa'Cataca\" (originally from [[José María Peñaranda]], then interpreted by La [[Sonora Matancera]].)"
