  "description": "'''Truck-driving country''' or '''trucker country''' is a subgenre of [[country and western music]]. It is characterized by lyrical content about trucks (i.e. [[commercial vehicles]], not [[Pickup truck|pick-up trucks]]), [[truck driver]]s or truckers, and the [[trucking industry]] experience. This includes, for example, references to [[truck stop]]s, [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]], trucker jokes, attractive women, romance, heartbreak, loneliness, [[stimulant]]s and [[eugeroic]]s, [[teamster]]s, roads and highways, billboards, inclement weather, traffic, [[Interstate Commerce Commission|ICC]], [[Department of Transportation|DOT]], car accidents, washrooms, etc. In truck-driving country, references to \"truck\" include the following truck types: 10 wheeler, straight truck, [[Semi-trailer truck|18 wheeler]], tractor ([[Tractor unit|bobtail]]), semi, tractor-trailer, semi tractor trailer, big rig, and some others. Truck-driving country musicians include [[Dave Dudley]], [[Red Sovine]], [[Terry Fell]], [[Dick Curless]], [[Red Simpson]], [[Del Reeves]], [[the Willis Brothers]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Junior Brown]], [[Commander Cody]], [[C. W. McCall]] (1976 big hit \"[[Convoy (song)|Convoy]]\"), Mac Wiseman, and [[Cledus Maggard]]. [[Terry Fell]] released \"Truck Drivin' Man\" in 1954.\n\nIt shares some overlap with road music (e.g. [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", [[Roger Miller]]'s \"[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]\"), which may or may not involve commercial trucks but carries many of the same themes of the traveling worker. It is not to be confused with the frequent use of the personal-use pickup truck in [[bro-country]], where the vehicle is mainly used as a [[pick-up line|pick-up device]].",
