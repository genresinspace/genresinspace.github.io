  "description": "'''Internet rap''' (originally known as '''blog rap''') is a style of hip hop that emerged in the late 2000s, initially spreading through online social media platforms like [[Myspace]] as well as mixtape-sharing site [[DatPiff]]. It encompasses various subgenres, microgenres, and aesthetics that are deeply intertwined with internet culture, memes, and digital communities. Unlike traditional [[hip-hop]], internet rap is often primarily influenced by the internet and is born out of online communities and sites like [[SoundCloud]]. Songs are frequently promoted and shared on platforms such as [[YouTube]], [[TikTok]], and [[Instagram]].\n\nThough many internet rappers achieve mainstream success, many artists within this label have been described as alternative or \"underground rap.\" The scene was originally based primarily on [[trap music]] but later gave rise to several [[microgenre]]s and [[internet subculture]]s, such as [[cloud rap]], [[Plugg music|plugg]], [[emo rap]], [[phonk]], [[mumble rap]], [[sigilkore]], [[digicore]], and [[Jerkin'|jerk]].",
