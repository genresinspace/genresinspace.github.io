  "description": "'''Minimal music''' (also called '''minimalism''') is a form of [[art music]] or other compositional practice that employs limited or minimal musical materials. Prominent features of minimalist music include [[repetition (music)|repetitive]] patterns or [[pulse (music)|pulses]], steady [[drone (music)|drones]], [[consonance and dissonance|consonant harmony]], and reiteration of musical [[phrase (music)|phrases]] or smaller units. It may include features such as [[phase shift]]ing, resulting in what is termed [[phase music]], or process techniques that follow strict rules, usually described as [[process music]]. The approach is marked by a non-narrative, non-[[teleology|teleological]], and non-[[representation (arts)|representation]]al approach, and calls attention to the activity of [[listening]] by focusing on the internal processes of the music.\n\nThe approach originated on the [[West Coast of the United States]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly around the [[Bay Area]], where [[La Monte Young]], [[Terry Riley]] and [[Steve Reich]] were studying and living at the time. After the three composers moved to the East Coast, their music became associated with the New York [[Downtown music]] scene of the mid-1960s, where it was initially viewed as a form of [[experimental music]] called the ''New York Hypnotic School.'' In the [[Classical music|Western art music]] tradition, the American composers [[Moondog]], La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich and [[Philip Glass]] are credited with being among the first to develop compositional techniques that exploit a minimal approach. The movement originally involved dozens of composers, although only five (Young, Riley, Reich, Glass, and later [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]) emerged to become publicly associated with American minimal music; other lesser known pioneers included [[Dennis Johnson (composer)|Dennis Johnson]], [[Terry Jennings]], [[Richard Maxfield]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Phill Niblock]], and [[James Tenney]]. In Europe, the music of [[Louis Andriessen]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Michael Nyman]], [[Howard Skempton]], [[Éliane Radigue]], [[Gavin Bryars]], [[Steve Martland]], [[Peter Michael Hamel]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Arvo Pärt]] and [[John Tavener]] exhibits minimalist traits.\n\nIt is unclear where the term ''minimal music'' originates. Steve Reich has suggested that it is attributable to Michael Nyman, an assertion that two scholars, Jonathan Bernard, and Dan Warburton, have also made in writing. Philip Glass believes [[Tom Johnson (composer)|Tom Johnson]] coined the phrase.",
