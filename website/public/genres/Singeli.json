  "description": "'''Singeli''' or sometimes called '''Sengeli''' is a [[Tanzania|Tanzanian]] music genre that originated with the [[Zaramo people|Zaramo]] in the Mtogole neighborhood of the [[Tandale]] ward in [[Kinondoni District]] of [[Dar es Salaam Region]] around the mid-2000s. The genre has since the late 2010s spread throughout Tanzania, and since 2020 the surrounding [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]]. This is purely Tanzanian music. It is not Soukous (Congolese music) or Taarab (Arabic music). Singeli is a [[Ngoma music|ngoma]] music and dance where an MC performs over fast tempo [[taarab]] music, often at between 200 and 300 [[Tempo|beats per minute (BPM)]], while women dance. Male and female MCs are near equally common, however styles between MC gender typically differ significantly. Male MCs usually perform in fast-paced [[Rapping|rap]], while female MCs usually perform kwaya.\n\nIn the early 2000s ''vigodoro'', meaning all night parties, began being organized by [[Zaramo people|Zaramo]] women for their other female family and friends particularly [[Manzese]] and [[Tandale]] wards. However the latter is considered the birthplace of the genre. The parties involved playing cassette tapes of taarab music that other women would come and dance to. As ''vigodoro'' parties grew MCs would be invited to come and perform over the cassettes. Msaga Sumu was one such MC and is considered one of the early founders of Singeli."
