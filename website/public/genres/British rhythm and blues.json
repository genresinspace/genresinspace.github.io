  "description": "'''British rhythm and blues''' (or '''R&B''') was a musical movement that developed in the [[United Kingdom]] between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s. It overlapped with, but was distinct from, the broader [[Beat music|British beat]] and more purist [[British blues]] scenes, attempting to emulate the music of American [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]] pioneers, such as [[Muddy Waters]] and [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]]. It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy.\n\nThe origins of the movement were in the [[British jazz]], [[skiffle]] and [[British folk revival|folk]] movements of the 1950s. The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures [[Cyril Davies]] and [[Alexis Korner]] to turn to [[electric blues]] and form the band [[Blues Incorporated]], which became something of a clearing house for British [[rhythm and blues]] musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[the Animals]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Them (band)|Them]], and [[the Spencer Davis Group]], who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, in the wake of the [[beat music|Merseybeat]] craze, becoming central to the [[beatnik]] and [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] in the UK and a second wave of [[British Invasion]] acts in the US.\n\nSeveral of the bands and their members went on to become leading [[rock music]] performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, helping to create [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[hard rock]] and making rhythm and blues a key component of that music. In the mid to late-1970s, British R&B enjoyed a revival through the [[British soul]] and [[disco]] scenes, the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] circuit, [[new wave music]] and the [[mod revival]], and has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the late 1980s. In the 2000s, a British version of [[contemporary R&B]] began gaining popularity, and since the late 2000s the success of British female singers influenced by soul and R&B led to talk of another \"R&B British invasion\"."
