  "description": "'''Electronic body music''' ('''EBM''') is a genre of [[electronic music]] that combines elements of [[industrial music]] and [[synth-punk]] with elements of [[dance music]]. It developed in the early 1980s in [[Western Europe]], as an outgrowth of both the [[Punk rock|punk]] and the industrial music cultures. It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed [[disco]] rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and [[Military order (instruction)|command-like]] shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.\n\nThe evolution of the genre reflected \"a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of [[post-punk]].\" It was considered a part of the European [[New wave music|new wave]] and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. [[Pogo (dance)|pogo]]).\n\nEBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s. Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as [[rivethead]]s.",
