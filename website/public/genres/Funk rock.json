  "description": "'''Funk rock''' is a [[fusion genre]] that mixes elements of [[funk]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. [[James Brown]] and others declared that [[Little Richard]] and his mid-1950s road band, [[The Upsetters (American band)|the Upsetters]], were the first to put the funk in the rock and roll beat, with a biographer stating that their music \"spark[ed] the musical transition from fifties rock and roll to sixties funk\".{{sfn|Palmer|2011|p=139}}\n\nFunk rock's earliest incarnation on record was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[The Isley Brothers]], [[Redbone (band)|Redbone]], [[Rick Derringer]], [[David Bowie]], [[Defunkt]], [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Cold Blood (band)|Cold Blood]], [[Shuggie Otis]], [[James Gang]], [[Rare Earth (band)]], [[Graham Central Station]], [[Wild Cherry (band)|Wild Cherry]], the [[Average White Band]], [[James Blood Ulmer]], [[Gary Wright]], [[Black Merda]], [[Bar-Kays]], [[Edwin Birdsong]], [[Betty Davis]], and [[Mother's Finest]]. During the 1980s and 1990s funk rock music experienced a surge in popularity, with bands such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince &]] [[The Revolution (band)|The Revolution]], [[Tom Tom Club]], [[Maximum Joy]], [[Pigbag]], [[INXS]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Devo]], the [[Fine Young Cannibals]] and [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] dabbling in the sound. Groups including [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Mr. Bungle]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and [[Faith No More]] also notably combined funk rock with [[Heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[experimental rock|experimental]] music, leading to the emergence of the genre known as [[funk metal]] or \"punk-funk\".\n\nFunk rock is a fusion of funk music and rock music also from the point of view of instrumentation, in fact it incorporates that of both genres into itself, and the overall sound is shaped by a definitive [[bass guitar|bass]] or [[drum]] beat and by [[electric guitar]]s.",
