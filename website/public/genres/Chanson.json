The term is most commonly used in English to refer either to the secular [[polyphonic]] French songs of late [[medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] or to a specific style of [[French pop music]] which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Wilkins|2001|loc=Introduction}} The [[genre]] had origins in the [[monophony|monophonic]] songs of [[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s, though the only polyphonic precedents were 16 works by [[Adam de la Halle]] and one by [[Jehan de Lescurel]].{{sfn|Wilkins|2001|loc=1. Origins to about 1430}} Not until the ''[[ars nova]]'' composer [[Guillaume de Machaut]] did any composer write a significant number of polyphonic chansons.{{sfn|Wilkins|2001|loc=1. Origins to about 1430}}\n\nA broad term, the word ''chanson'' literally means \"'''song'''\" in French and can thus less commonly refer to a variety of (usually [[secular]]) French genres throughout history. This includes the songs of [[chansonnier]], ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and [[Grand chant]]; court songs of the late Renaissance and early [[Baroque music]] periods, ''[[air de cour]]''; popular songs from the 17th to 19th century, ''[[bergerette]]'', ''[[brunette (song form)|brunette]]'', ''[[chanson pour boire]]'', ''[[pastourelle]]'', and [[vaudeville]]; [[art song]] of the [[romantic music|romantic]] era, ''[[mélodie]]''; and folk music, ''{{ill|Chanson populaire (chanson)|fr|lt=chanson populaire}}''.{{sfn|Wilkins|2001|loc=Introduction}} Since the 1990s, the term may be used for '''[[Nouvelle Chanson]]''', a French song that often contains poetic or political content.",
