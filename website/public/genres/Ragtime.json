  "description": "'''Ragtime''', also spelled '''rag-time''' or '''rag time''', is a musical style that had its peak from the 1890s to 1910s. Its cardinal trait is its [[syncopated]] or \"ragged\" [[rhythm]]. Ragtime was popularized during the early 20th century by composers such as [[Scott Joplin]], [[James Scott (composer)|James Scott]], and [[Joseph Lamb (composer)|Joseph Lamb]]. Ragtime pieces (often called \"rags\") are typically composed for and performed on [[piano]], though the genre has been adapted for a variety of instruments and styles.\n\nRagtime music originated within [[African American]] communities in the late 19th century and became a distinctly American form of popular music. It is closely related to [[American march music|marches]]. Ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, often arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Scott Joplin, known as the \"King of Ragtime\", gained fame through compositions like \"[[Maple Leaf Rag]]\" and \"[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]\". Ragtime influenced early [[jazz]], Harlem [[stride piano]], [[Piedmont blues]], and early 20th century European classical composers such as [[Erik Satie]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]]. Despite being overshadowed by jazz in the 1920s, ragtime has experienced several revivals, notably in the 1950s and 1970s (the latter renaissance due in large part to the use of \"The Entertainer\" in the film ''[[The Sting]]''). The music was distributed primarily through [[sheet music]] and [[piano roll]]s, with some compositions adapted for other instruments and ensembles.",
