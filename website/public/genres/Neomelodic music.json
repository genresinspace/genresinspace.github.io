  "description": "'''Neomelodic music''', or '''musica neomelodica''', sometimes just '''neomelodico''' is a [[Music genre|musical style]] originating from the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Naples]].\n\nDrawing on older forms such as [[canzone napoletana]] and [[sceneggiata]], the genre features emotional vocal performances, colloquial lyrics, and hybrid musical elements combining Neapolitan melodies with global pop influences. Songs often address romantic conflict, family dynamics, and working-class life, and are typically performed in the Neapolitan dialect.\n\nNeomelodic music developed through informal networks of production and circulation, including local festivals, television, and street media. More recently, digital platforms have expanded its reach to audiences across Italy and the diaspora. In Europe, especially Germany and Belgium, emigrant communities have maintained dedicated markets for the genre, while in the United States, its influence has remained limited.\n\nThe genre has drawn criticism for its alleged glorification of organized crime and perceived cultural marginality, but also been defended as an authentic expression of southern identity and social reality. Its ties to the Camorra and association with Naplesâ€™ informal economy have further shaped debates around censorship, legitimacy, and representation.",
