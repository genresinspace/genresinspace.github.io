  "description": "A '''bélé''' is a [[folk dance]] and [[folk music|music]] from [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Haiti]], [[Martinique]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It may be the oldest Creole dance of the creole French West Indian Islands, and it strongly reflects influences from African [[fertility]] dances. It is performed most commonly during [[full moon]] evenings, or sometimes during [[funeral wake]]s ([[Antillean Creole]]: ''lavèyé''). In [[Tobago]], it is thought to have been performed by women of the planter class at social events in the planters' great houses, and the dress and dance style copied by the enslaved people who worked in or around these houses [http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Birthplace-of-the-bele-112487054.html]. \n \nThe term ''bélé'' also refers to a kind of drum used in some forms of music of Caribbean countries and islands like [[Dominica]], [[Haiti]], [[Martinique]] and [[Saint Lucia]].",
