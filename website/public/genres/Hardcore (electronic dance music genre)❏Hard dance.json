  "description": "'''Hard dance''' is an umbrella category of electronic dance music genres characterized by fast tempos and hard kick drums, but less harsh-sounding and often a bit slower than hardcore. The category includes [[UK hard house|hard house]], [[hard trance]], [[hardstyle]], some forms of [[Eurodance]] and regional genres, such as [[mákina]], [[lento violento]] and others. Sometimes the category has crossovers with hardcore genres such as [[frenchcore]] or [[UK hardcore]]. Despite this, the category is sometimes referred to as synonymous with hardcore techno music generally.",
