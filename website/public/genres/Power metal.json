  "description": "'''Power metal''' is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with [[speed metal]], often within a [[symphony|symphonic]] context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in, for example, [[extreme metal]]. Power metal bands usually have anthemic songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound. \n\nThe term was first used in the mid-1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal; and a later, more widespread and popular style based in Europe with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]].",
