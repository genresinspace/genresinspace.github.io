  "description": "'''Jazz''' is a [[music genre]] that originated in the [[African Americans|African-American]] communities of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its roots are in [[blues]], [[ragtime]], European [[harmony]], African rhythmic rituals, [[spirituals]], [[hymns]], [[march (music)|marches]], [[vaudeville]] song, and [[dance music]]. Since the 1920s [[Jazz Age]], it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music]]. Jazz is characterized by [[swung note|swing]] and [[blue note]]s, complex [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Call and response (music)|call and response vocals]], [[polyrhythm]]s and [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]].\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier [[brass band]] marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and blues with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]]. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]] (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and [[gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of [[hard bop]], which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. [[Jazz fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
