  "description": "'''Dirty rap''' (also known as '''porno rap''', '''porn rap''', '''sex rap''', '''booty rap''', or '''pornocore''') is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that contains lyrical content revolving mainly around sexually explicit subjects.\n\nThe lyrics are often overtly explicit and graphic, sometimes to the point of being comical or offensive. Historically, dirty rap often contained a distinctly [[bass (sound)|bass]]-driven sound, which arose from the popular (and usually sexually explicit) [[Miami bass]] rap scene. However, dirty rap has recently also been heavily influenced by [[Baltimore club]], [[ghetto house]], and [[ghettotech]]. Many dirty rap songs have been used as [[soundtrack]]s to [[pornographic movies]] since the 2000s, replacing the traditional [[porn groove]].",
