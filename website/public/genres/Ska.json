  "description": "'''Ska''' ({{IPAc-en|s|k|aː}}; {{langx|jam|label=[[Jamaican Creole]]|skia}}, {{IPA|jam|skjæ|}}) is a [[music genre]] that originated in [[Jamaica]] in the late 1950s and was the precursor to [[rocksteady]] and [[reggae]]. It combined elements of [[Caribbean]] [[mento]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] with [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Ska is characterized by a [[walking bass]] line accented with rhythms on the [[Off-beat (music)|off beat]]. It was developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when [[Stranger Cole]], [[Prince Buster]], [[Coxsone Dodd|Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd]], and [[Duke Reid]] formed [[Reggae sound system|sound system]]s to play American rhythm and blues and then began recording their own songs. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with [[mod (subculture)|British mods]] and with many [[skinhead]]s.\n\nMusic historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s; the [[Two-tone (music genre)|2 tone]] ska revival of the late 1970s in Britain, which fused Jamaican ska rhythms and melodies with the faster tempos and harder edge of [[punk rock]] forming [[ska-punk]]; and [[third-wave ska]], which involved bands from a wide range of countries around the world, in the late 1980s and 1990s.",
