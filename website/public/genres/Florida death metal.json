  "description": "'''Florida death metal''' is a regional scene and stylistic subdivision of [[death metal]]. Some of the most significantly pioneering and best-selling death metal acts emerged in [[Florida]], especially in the [[Tampa Bay area]]. As a result, Tampa is unofficially known by many death metal fans as the \"capital of death metal.\" The scene coalesced in the mid-1980s through early 1990s around the output of bands such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Nasty Savage]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Monstrosity (band)|Monstrosity]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], and others. The producer [[Scott Burns (record producer)|Scott Burns]] and the studio [[Morrisound Recording]] were also instrumental in developing and popularizing the Florida scene. Some bands which originated outside of Florida, such as [[Malevolent Creation]] and [[Cannibal Corpse]], relocated to the state in order to participate in this burgeoning scene. The Florida bands featured a more technical approach to the evolving death metal sound, a style which spread beyond the confines of the state, and some were instrumental in creating the [[Technical death metal|progressive death metal]] subgenre. The death metal genre as a whole, including the Florida scene, declined in popularity in the second half of the 1990s, but many bands within the Florida scene persisted and the scene resurged in popularity in subsequent decades. Although the scene attracted more media attention, it continued to be [[Underground culture|underground]] due to its [[Extreme metal|extreme]] nature."
