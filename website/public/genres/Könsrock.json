  "description": "'''Könsrock''' (Swedish for ''Genitalia rock'') is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[music genre]] characterized by [[off-color humor]], dealing with subjects such as [[handicapped]] people, disorders and diseases, [[homosexuality]], and [[Nazism]], often with strong elements of [[toilet humor]].\n\nThe term ''könsrock'' was coined by music journalists to describe the genre after it had existed for a couple of decades, and has in general not been used by the artists themselves."
