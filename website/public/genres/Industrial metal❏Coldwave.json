  "description": "Coldwave is a subgenre of industrial metal originating in the 1990s. It has its roots in acts like [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]. The style focuses on heavier, punk-based guitars, sampled hard rock-like guitars, synthesizer accompaniment, and acid house elements. Lyrical content is typically cyberpunk-oriented with pop music sensibilities, although it can vary.\n\n[[Chemlab]]'s 1993 album [[Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar]] is often considered the album that defined the coldwave style.\n\nArtists like the aforementioned Chemlab, [[16 Volt]] and [[Acumen Nation]] exemplified this genre.\n\nThe coldwave style began to wane rapidly when industrial music in general started to lose popularity in the latter half of the 1990s-early 2000's. Many artists within the genre moved on to different styles that included Hard rock, heavy metal, nu metal, cyber metal, synth-metal, synth-rock, and synth-pop among other genres.\n\nColdwave today is a small, niche scene within industrial music. Very few bands today describe themselves or are described as coldwave. Bands like [[Cyanotic (band)|Cyanotic]] and Medicant Downline are perhaps the exception.\n\nDespite sharing the same name as the [[Cold wave (music)|French genre]], it is otherwise unrelated.",
