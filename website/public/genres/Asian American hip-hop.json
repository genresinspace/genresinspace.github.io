  "description": "The influence and impact of [[hip hop]] was originally shaped from African American communities in the [[South Bronx]]. In the last several decades, the abundant Asian and Asian American presence in hip hop has become a worldwide phenomenon and one factor of their exponential participation in hip hop culture can be credited to the emergence of collegiate California-based dance teams that propagated from the culture-centric/ethnic-centric clubs on campuses; in the mid 1980's to the late 1990's the first generation of collegiate teams had been inspired by dance films such as [[Breakin'|''Breakin' (1983)'']], ''[[Flashdance]] [<nowiki/>[[Rock Steady Crew|Rocksteady Crew]]]'' (1983) and popular house party dances like ''Wop'' and the [[Running man (dance)|''Running Man'']]. The following generation of collegiate dance teams were further nurtured by the commercial successes of films like [[Save the Last Dance|''Save the Last Dance (2001)'']], [[Honey (2003 film)|''Honey (2003)'']], [[You Got Served|''You Got Served (2004)'']], [[Step Up (film)|''Step Up (2006)'']], and [[Stomp the Yard|''Stomp The Yard (2007)'']]. Television shows such as [[So You Think You Can Dance (American TV series)|''So You Think You Can Dance (2005)'']], [[America's Best Dance Crew season 1|''America's Best Dance Crew (2008)'']]; and finally Internet video sharing websites such as [[YouTube|''YouTube (2005)'']] facilitated greater exposure of hip hop dance culture to mass audiences, both domestic and international. Technological advancements and forms of communication and publishing have allowed the movement to become a worldwide phenomenon which transcends different cultural boundaries. Asian American hip-hop practitioners include: [[MC Jin]], [[Lyrics Born]], [[Dumbfoundead]], [[Tokimonsta]], and [[DJ Q-Bert]].",
