  "description": "'''Partido Alto''' refers to a type of [[samba]] with a number of particularities. In the world of samba subgenres and in samba reunions, partido alto songs (informally called ''partidos'') can represent a time for improvisation and (humorous or not) disputes, besides a stronger singalong opportunity for the participants.\n\nPartido Alto is also the name of a particular rhythm that is derived from the above-mentioned style of samba (especially in a jazz context).  The rhythm is often played in samba, and is also the basis for the Partido Alto groove, in which more or all of the instruments accent this rhythm."
