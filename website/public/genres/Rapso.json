Six years later, [[Cheryl Byron]] (founder of the [[New York City]] based Something Positive Dance Company) was scorned when she sang rapso at a [[calypso tent]]. She is now called the \"Mother of Rapso\".{{sfn|van Leeuwaarde Moonsammy|2010|p=221}}\n\nIt has been described as \"{{lang|trf|de power of de word in the riddim of de word}}\". Though often described as a fusion of native [[soca music|soca]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] with American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], rapso is uniquely Trinidadian."
