  "description": "'''Rumba''' is a secular genre of [[Cuban music]] involving dance, percussion, and song. It originated in the northern regions of Cuba, mainly in urban [[Havana]] and [[Matanzas]], during the late 19th century. It is based on African music and dance traditions, namely [[Abakuá]] and [[yuka (music)|yuka]], as well as the Spanish-based ''[[coros de clave]]''. According to [[Argeliers León]], rumba is one of the major \"genre complexes\" of Cuban music, and the term '''rumba complex''' is now commonly used by musicologists. This complex encompasses the three traditional forms of rumba (yambú, [[guaguancó]] and columbia), as\nwell as their contemporary derivatives and other minor styles.\n\nTraditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and ''solares'' (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance. Vocal improvisation, elaborate dancing and [[polyrhythm]]ic drumming are the key components of all rumba styles. ''[[Cajón de rumba|Cajones]]'' (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by ''tumbadoras'' ([[conga drum]]s). During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, [[Los Muñequitos de Matanzas]], Clave y Guaguancó, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo.\n\nSince its early days, the genre's popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island. In the United States, it gave its name to the so-called \"ballroom rumba\", or [[rhumba]], and in Africa, [[soukous]] is commonly referred to as \"[[Congolese rumba]]\" (despite being actually based on [[son cubano]]). Its influence in Spain is testified by [[rumba flamenca]] and derivatives such as [[Catalan rumba]]."
