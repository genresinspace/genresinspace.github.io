  "description": "'''Progressive rap''' (or '''progressive hip hop'''){{refn|group=nb|\"Hip hop\" is traditionally used by academics and intellectuals within [[hip-hop]] culture to distinguish the culture's aspects of artistic authenticity and [[political consciousness]] from more problematic dimensions that are instead relegated under the term \"rap\", such as [[commercialism]], violence, and [[sexism]], according to [[Marc Lamont Hill]]. Writing in 2010, Hill explains that this \"hip-hop/rap\" spectrum is often used as a theoretical framework to \"evaluate hip-hop artists\" and \"enables fans, artists, and critics to mimic the [[elitist]] postures of earlier European traditions by creating [[high culture|high]]/[[low culture|low]] distinctions within the culture.\"{{sfn|Hill|2010|p=102}}}} is a broad subgenre of [[Hip-hop|hip hop music]] that aims to progress the genre thematically with [[Social transformation|socially transformative]] ideas and musically with stylistic experimentation. Developing through the works of innovative US hip hop acts during the 1980s and 1990s, it has also been known at various points as [[Political hip-hop|conscious]], [[Underground hip-hop|underground]], and [[Alternative hip-hop|alternative hip hop]].\n\nProgressive rap music [[critical thinking|critically examine]]s social issues, political responsibility, and [[existential]] concerns, particularly in the context of [[African American|African-American life]] and [[youth culture]]. Common themes include [[social injustice]], [[social inequality|inequality]], [[social status|status]], identity, and religion, with [[discourse]]s around ideologies such as [[Afrocentricity]] and [[Religion of black Americans|Black religiosity]]. Unlike the genre's more commercially-dominant counterpart [[gangsta rap]], prog-rap artists typically disavow intracultural violence and [[economic materialism]] in favor of constructive and educational responses such as [[consciousness]], [[racial uplift|uplift]], [[cultural heritage|heritage]], humor, and activism.\n\nProductions in the genre often take on [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] approaches and wide-ranging influences, such as [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[soul music|soul]]. Examples have included the works of [[De La Soul]], [[Fugees]], [[Outkast]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Kendrick Lamar]]. The music of such acts, especially in the 21st century, has impacted the mainstream sensibilities of hip hop while [[counterculture|countering]] racist [[stereotype]]s pervasive in Western [[popular culture]].",
