  "description": "'''Bhangra''' ({{IPA|pa|ˈpə̀ŋɡ(ə)ɽaː|Punjabi pron|Bhangra_pronunciation.ogg}}) is a type of traditional music of [[Punjab]] originating from the Punjab region. It is a prominent form of entertainment and a traditional means of expressing joy, particularly during festive and celebratory occasions. The dhol, a double-sided drum played with two sticks, is the best-known instrument in Bhangra, traditionally accompanied by instruments like the tumbi, sarangi, dholak, and various modern additions such as the synthesizer and guitar.\n\nOver the years, bhangra has evolved and gained popularity not only in South Asia but also around the world. It has become a significant part of the cultural identity of the Punjabi diaspora in countries like [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Prior to this musical fusion, bhangra existed only as a [[Bhangra (dance)|dance form]] in the native Punjab. This Punjabi music was unique in that it was not traditional nor did it seek any authenticity. While the traditional folk music of Punjab has a set of melodies that are used by various singers, bhangra was a form of strict \"band culture\" in that new melodies were composed for each song. Therefore, the musicians were as important as the singers.",
