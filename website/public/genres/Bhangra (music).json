  "description": "'''Bhangra''' ({{IPA|pa|ˈpə̀ŋɡ(ə)ɽaː|Punjabi pron|Bhangra_pronunciation.ogg}}) is a type of non-traditional music of [[Punjab]] originating from the Punjab region.\n\nOver the years, bhangra has evolved and gained popularity not only in South Asia but also around the world. It has become a significant part of the cultural identity of the Punjabi diaspora in countries like [[Australia]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. Prior to this musical fusion, bhangra existed only as a [[Bhangra (dance)|dance form]] in the native Punjab. This Punjabi music was unique in that it was not traditional nor did it seek any authenticity. While the traditional folk music of Punjab has a set of melodies that are used by various singers, bhangra was a form of strict \"band culture\" in that new melodies were composed for each song. Therefore, the musicians were as important as the singers.",
