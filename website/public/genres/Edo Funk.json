  "description": "'''Edo funk''' is a musical style from [[Benin City]], [[Edo State]], created in the early 1970s. The Edo Funk music genre  is a cosmopolitan popular dance music with integrating elements from the native [[Edo people|Edo culture]] and fusing them with new sound effects coming from [[Nigerian ]] night-clubs. Nick Roseblade describes Edo Funk as \"[a] hybrid music that mixed traditional rhythms, jazz horns, driving drums, day-glo keyboards, and wonky guitars. It reduced everything down to the bare minimum.\"\n\nEdo Funk's  pioneers and best known exponent is [[Victor Uwaifo]], who has released a series of Edo Funk album recordings starting in the 1970s with other Edo musicians such as [[Akaba Man]],  [[Osayomore Joseph]], Ukodo, [[Fabomo]] and [[Collins Oke]]. [[Ekassa]] and [[Akwete]] were also the sub genres of Edo Funk, to interpret the traditional Benin sound.\n\nIn 2021, German Record label [[Analog Africa]] released Edo Funk Explosion Vol. 1, a compilation of song by Victor Uwaifo, Osayomore Joseph and Akaba Man.",
