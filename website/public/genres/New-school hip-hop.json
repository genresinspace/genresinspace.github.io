  "description": "The '''new school of hip-hop''' was a mid-1980s movement in [[Hip-hop|hip-hop music]], led by artists such as [[Run-DMC]], [[LL Cool J]], and the [[Beastie Boys]]. Predominantly from [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]], it was characterized by [[drum machine]]-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of [[rock music|rock]]; [[rapping|rapped]] taunts, boasts, and socio-political commentary; and aggressive, self-assertive delivery. In song and image, its artists projected a tough, cool, street [[Breakdancing|B-boy]] attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with [[Funk]] and [[Disco]], [[Novelty song|novelty hits]], live bands, synthesizers, and party rhymes of artists prevalent in the early 1980s. Compared to previous artists, new-school artists crafted more cohesive [[LP record|LP]]s and shorter songs more amenable to [[airplay]]. By 1986–87, their releases began to establish hip-hop in the mainstream. This, along with further innovations by artists like [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Public Enemy]], and [[Boogie Down Productions]], led into the [[golden age hip-hop|golden age of hip-hop]].\n\nThe terms \"old school\" and \"new school\" fell into the vernacular as synonyms for \"old\" and \"new\" in hip-hop, to the confusion and occasional exasperation of writers who use the terms historically. The phrase \"Leader of the New School\", coined in hip-hop by Chuck D in 1988, and given further currency by the [[eponymous]] group [[Leaders of the New School]] (who were named by Chuck D before signing with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in 1989), remains popular. It has been applied to artists ranging from [[Jay-Z]] to [[Lupe Fiasco]].",
