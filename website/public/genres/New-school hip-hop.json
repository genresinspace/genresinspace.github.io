  "description": "The '''new school of hip hop''' was a movement in [[Hip-hop|hip hop music]], beginning in 1983â€“84 with the early records of [[Run-DMC]], [[Whodini]], and [[LL Cool J]]. Predominantly from [[Queens]] and [[Brooklyn]], it was characterized by [[drum machine]]-led minimalism, often tinged with elements of [[rock music|rock]]; [[rapping|rapped]] taunts, boasts, and socio-political commentary; and aggressive, self-assertive delivery. In song and image, its artists projected a tough, cool, street [[Breakdancing|B-boy]] attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with [[Funk]] and [[Disco]], [[Novelty song|novelty hits]], live bands, synthesizers, and party rhymes of artists prevalent in the early 1980s. Compared to their older hip hop counterparts, new school artists crafted more cohesive [[LP record|LP]]s and shorter songs more amenable to [[airplay]]. By 1986, their releases began to establish hip hop in the mainstream.\n\nThe somewhat broader era of [[Golden age hip-hop|golden age hip hop]] is applied to late 1980s-to-early 1990s mainstream hip hop, characterized by diversity, quality, innovation and influence, and associated with [[Public Enemy]], [[KRS-One]] and his [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Ultramagnetic MCs]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and the [[Jungle Brothers]], known for themes of [[Afrocentricity]] and political militancy, experimental music, and eclectic [[Sampling (music)|sampling]]. This period is sometimes referred to as \"Mid-school\" or \"middle school\"; associated acts included [[Gang Starr]], [[the UMC's]], [[Main Source]], [[Lord Finesse]], [[EPMD]], [[Just Ice]], [[Stetsasonic]], [[True Mathematics]], and [[Mantronix]].\n\nThe innovations of Run-D.M.C., [[MC Shan]], and LL Cool J, and New School Producers such as Larry Smith and [[Rick Rubin]] of [[Def Jam]], were quickly surpassed by [[Beastie Boys]], [[Marley Marl]] and his [[Juice Crew]] MCs, [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy]], and [[Eric B. & Rakim]]. Hip-hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]] technology. [[Rakim]] took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and [[Chuck D]] pushed \"message rap\" towards black activism. [[Native Tongues]] artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, [[Afrocentricity]], and playful energy.  The new school/golden age ended with the eventual commercial dominance of [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] [[gangsta rap]], particularly the emergence of the relaxed sounds of [[G-funk]] by the early nineties, while the [[East Coast hip-hop|East Coast]] scene became dominated by hardcore rappers such as the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and gangsta rappers such as [[Nas]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]]\n\nThe terms \"old school\" and \"new school\" fell into the vernacular as synonyms for \"old\" and \"new\" in hip hop, to the confusion and occasional exasperation of writers who use the terms historically.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The phrase \"Leader of The New School\", coined in hip hop by Chuck D in 1988, and given further currency by the [[eponymous]] group [[Leaders of the New School]] (who were named by Chuck D before signing with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in 1989), remains popular.  It has been applied to artists ranging from [[Jay-Z]] to [[Lupe Fiasco]]."
