  "description": "'''Folk rock''' is a fusion genre of [[rock music]] with heavy influences from [[pop music|pop]], [[English folk music|English]] and [[American folk music]].{{better source|reason=website, no author identified, no references listed|date=June 2025}} It arose in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom in the mid-1960s. In the U.S., folk rock emerged from the [[American folk music revival|folk music revival]]. Performers such as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]]—several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles—attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre-existing folk repertoire, adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U.S. folk community. The term \"folk rock\" was initially used in the U.S. [[Music journalism|music press]] in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music.\n\nThe commercial success of the Byrds' [[cover version]] of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" and their debut [[album]] [[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|of the same name]], along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965), ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (1965), and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as [[Simon & Garfunkel]], to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as [[Buffalo Springfield]], to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.\n\nDuring the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic [[British folk rock]] style was created by [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Alan Stivell]]. Inspired by British [[psychedelic folk]] and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of [[the Albion Band]] and [[Celtic rock]].\n{{toclimit|3}}",
