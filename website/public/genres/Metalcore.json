  "description": "'''Metalcore''' is a broadly defined fusion genre combining elements of [[extreme metal]] and [[hardcore punk]], originating in the 1990s [[United States]] and becoming popular in the 2000s. Metalcore typically has aggressive verses and melodic choruses, combined with [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]] â€“ which are slow, intense passages conducive to [[moshing]]. Other defining traits are low-tuned, percussive guitar riffs, [[double bass drumming]], and polished production. Vocalists typically switch between roaring or [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] and clean, melodic, emotional singing. Lyrics are often personal, introspective and emotive.\n\nIn the late 1980s to early 1990s, pioneering bands were founded such as [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]], [[Earth Crisis]] and [[Converge (band)|Converge]], whose hardcore punk-leaning style is sometimes referred to as '''metallic hardcore'''. These bands took influence from a range of styles and genres such as hardcore punk, [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]]. During the decade, the genre diversified, with Converge, [[the Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Botch (band)|Botch]] and [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] pioneering [[mathcore]], while [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]], [[Shadows Fall]] and [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]] merged the genre with [[melodic death metal]] to create [[melodic metalcore]]. \n\nDuring the early 2000s, melodic metalcore bands such as  [[Killswitch Engage]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Atreyu]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]] and [[Parkway Drive]] found mainstream popularity. In the subsequent years, the genre saw increased success through [[social networking]] on [[Myspace]] and [[internet meme]]s such as [[crabcore]]. During this time, artists began to draw influence from a wide variety of sources, which led to genre cultivating a plethora of fusion genres including [[electronicore]], [[deathcore]], [[Nintendocore]], [[progressive metalcore]] and [[nu metalcore]]. In the 2010s and through to the 2020s, the genre saw even greater commercial success, with albums by [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Architects (British band)|Architects]], [[Asking Alexandria]], [[the Devil Wears Prada (band)|the Devil Wears Prada]] and [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]] penetrating the top 10 of international albums charts.",
