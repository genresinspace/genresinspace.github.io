  "description": "'''Dub techno''' is a subgenre of electronic music that originated in the early 1990s, blending the repetitive, minimal structures of [[techno]] with the echo-laden, spacey production techniques of [[dub music]]. It is notable for its deep, atmospheric soundscapes, layers of elaborate [[bass (sound)|basslines]], slowly developing musical phrases featuring heavy [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] and [[reverb effect|reverb]] effects. Vocals are either absent, or inspired by dub and [[ambient music]].",
