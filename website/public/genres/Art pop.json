  "description": "'''Art pop''' is a loosely defined style of [[pop music]] that emerged in the mid-1960s, influenced by [[art theory|art theories]]{{sfn|Frith|1989|p=116, 208}} as well as ideas from other art mediums, such as [[fashion]], [[fine art]], [[film|cinema]], [[contemporary art]] and [[avant-garde]] literature.{{sfn|Buckley|2012|p=21}}{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=5}} The genre draws on [[pop art]]'s integration of [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]], and emphasizes imagery, style, and gesture over personal expression.{{sfn|Frith|1989|p=116, 208}}{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=184}} Art pop musicians may deviate from traditional pop audiences and [[rock music]] conventions, instead exploring [[postmodern]] approaches and ideas such as pop's status as [[commercial art]], notions of artifice and the [[self]], and questions of [[historical authenticity]].\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, British and American pop musicians such as [[Brian Wilson]], [[Phil Spector]], and [[the Beatles]] began incorporating the ideas of the pop art movement into their recordings. English art pop musicians drew from their [[art school]] studies,{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=5}} while in America the style drew on the influence of pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] and the affiliated band [[the Velvet Underground]].{{sfn|Frith|Horne|2016|pp=113–114}} The style would experience its \"golden age\" in the 1970s among [[glam rock]] artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[10cc]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], who embraced theatricality and [[throw-away society|throwaway pop culture]].\n\nArt pop's tradition continued in the late 1970s and 1980s through styles such as [[post-punk]] and [[synthpop]] as well as the British [[New Romantic]] scene, developing further with artists who rejected conventional rock instrumentation and structure in favor of [[dance music|dance]] styles and the [[synthesizer]]. The 2010s saw new art pop trends develop, such as [[hip hop]] artists drawing on [[visual art]] and [[vaporwave]] artists exploring the sensibilities of [[contemporary capitalism]] and the [[Internet]].",
