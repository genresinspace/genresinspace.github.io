  "description": "'''Illbient''' is a genre of [[electronic music]] and an [[art movement]] that originated among [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced [[Experimental music|experimental]] musicians from [[New York City]] in the early 1990s. The word \"illbient\" combines the [[hip hop]] [[slang]] term \"ill\" and \"ambient\"; [[DJ Olive]] and [[DJ Spooky]], pioneers of the genre, have claimed to have coined the term.\n\nThough there are many individualistic variants of illbient, the music is characterized by [[Dub music|dub]]- and [[Industrial music|industrial]]-influenced layering of beats and [[soundscape]]s, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced use of [[Break (music)|break]]s and [[Sampling (music)|samples]], and a progressive approach to beat programming that encompasses many forms of [[world music]] and electronic music.\n\nBesides DJ Olive and DJ Spooky, other notable names and acts that were part of the original illbient scene included [[Raz Mesinai]], [[We (illbient group)|We™]], [[Byzar]], [[Spectre (musician)|Spectre]] and the artists that were released on his ''WordSound'' label around that time. Subsequent illbient artists have included [[Techno Animal]], [[Sixtoo]] and [[Odd Nosdam]].",
