  "description": "'''Pagan metal''' is a genre of [[heavy metal music]] which fuses [[extreme metal]] with \"[[Paganism|the pre-Christian traditions of a specific culture or region]]\" through thematic concept, rustic melodies, unusual instruments or archaic languages, usually referring to [[folk metal]] or [[black metal]]. The Norwegian band [[In the Woods...]] was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal. ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' author Marc Halupczok wrote that [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]]'s song \"To Enter Pagan\" from the band's demo \"[[Dark Romanticism (Primordial album)|Dark Romanticism]]\" contributed to defining the genre."
