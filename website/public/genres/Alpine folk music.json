  "description": "'''Alpine folk music''' ({{langx|de|Alpenländische Volksmusik}}; [[German language|German]]'s ''Volksmusik'' means \"people's music\" or as a Germanic connotative translation, \"folk's music\") is the common umbrella designation of a number of related styles of [[Folk music|traditional folk music]] in the [[Alpine states|Alpine]] regions of [[Slovenia]], [[Northern Croatia]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italy]]).\n\nIt tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional lifestyles, cultures and traditions, particularly, those of the [[Alpine transhumance|Alpine farmers]] and peasants.\n\nOriginally transmitted by [[oral tradition]], the oldest historical records like the Appenzell ''[[Ranz des Vaches|Kuhreihen]]'' by [[Georg Rhau]] (1488–1548) date back to the 16th century. Alpine folk is characterized by [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]] and [[Variation (music)|variation]], uncomplicated [[Key (music)|major key]] [[Melody|melodies]] and simple [[Harmony|harmonies]]. Typical instruments range from [[alpenhorn]]s to [[hackbrett]]s, [[zither]]s and acoustic [[guitar]]s, and even [[violas]] and [[Steirische Harmonika|harmonica]]s. Harmonized singing is frequent, but other pieces may require [[yodeling]], while [[instrumental music|instrumental]] arrangements are particularly frequent for fast dances or brass pieces.\n\nAlpine folk continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with ''[[Volkstümliche Musik]]'', which is largely to be found in [[broadcasting]] [[Mass media|media]] and on ancillary [[merchandise]]. Since the 1970s, artists of a ''[[Neue Volksmusik]]'' genre, such as [[Werner Pirchner]] or [[Biermösl Blosn]], attempt to combine traditional styles with [[jazz]], [[Contemporary folk music|folk]], [[electronic music]], [[Rock music|rock]] et al. as a kind of [[world music]]. Popular proponents include [[Hubert von Goisern]], [[Attwenger]] and [[Christine Lauterburg]]."
