  "description": "'''Taqwacore''' is a subgenre of [[punk rock|punk music]] dealing with [[Islam]], its culture, and interpretation. Originally conceived in [[Michael Muhammad Knight]]'s 2003 novel, ''[[The Taqwacores]]'', the name is a [[portmanteau]] of \"[[hardcore punk|hardcore]]\" and the [[Arabic]] word \"[[taqwa]]\" (تقوى), which is usually translated as \"piety\" or the quality of being \"[[God in Islam|God]]-fearing\", and thus roughly denotes reverence and love of the divine. The scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the US and other Western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam, and thus live their own lifestyle within the religion or without.",
