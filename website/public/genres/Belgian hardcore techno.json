  "description": "'''Belgian hardcore techno''' (also referred to as '''Belgian techno''' or '''rave techno'''{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}) is an early style of [[hardcore techno]] that emerged from [[new beat]] as [[Electronic body music|EBM]] and [[techno]] influences became more prevalent in this genre. This particular style has been described as an \"apocalyptic, almost Wagnerian, bombastic techno\", due to its use of dramatic orchestral stabs and menacing synth tones that set it apart from earlier forms of electronic dance music. It flourished in [[Belgium]] and influenced the sound of early hardcore from [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[UK]] and [[North America]] during the early-1990s, as a part of the [[rave]] movement during that period.\n\nBelgian hardcore is related to both [[Techno|European techno]] and [[hardcore techno]], being generally considered an early form of the latter. The genre is referred to by several other names, such as \"Belgian rave\" and \"bretter tekkno\".\n\nThe immediate predecessors of Belgian hardcore were two short-lived new beat subgenres called \"hard beat\" and \"skizzo\"."
