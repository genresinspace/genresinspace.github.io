  "description": "'''Electronic music''' broadly is a group of [[music genre]]s that employ [[electronic musical instrument]]s, circuitry-based [[music technology]] and software, or general-purpose [[electronics]] (such as [[personal computer]]s) in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means ([[electroacoustic music]]). Pure electronic instruments depend entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an [[electronic oscillator]], [[theremin]], or [[synthesizer]]: no [[acoustic wave]]s need to be previously generated by mechanical means and then converted into electrical signals. On the other hand, electromechanical instruments have mechanical parts such as strings or hammers that generate the sound waves, together with electric elements including [[pickup (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], [[power amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s that convert the acoustic waves into electrical signals, process them and convert them back into sound waves. Such electromechanical devices include the [[telharmonium]], [[Hammond organ]], [[electric piano]] and [[electric guitar]].\n\nThe first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic [[tape music]] in the 1940s in Egypt and France. [[Musique concr√®te]], created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and [[algorithmic composition]] with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.\n\nDuring the 1960s, digital [[computer music]] was pioneered, innovation in [[live electronics]] took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the [[music industry]]. In the early 1970s, [[Moog synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on [[popular music]], with the adoption of [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s, [[electronic drum]]s, drum machines, and [[Turntablism|turntables]], through the emergence of genres such as [[disco]], [[krautrock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic dance music]] (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] became popular, and [[MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the [[Love Parade]] became the largest street party with over 1&nbsp;million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.\n\nContemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from [[Experimental music|experimental art music]] to popular forms such as electronic dance music. In recent years, electronic music has gained popularity in the Middle East, with artists from Iran and Turkey blending traditional instruments with ambient and techno influences. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.",
