  "description": "'''Parang''' is a popular folk music originating from [[Venezuela]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] that was brought to [[Trinidad and Tobago]] by [[Venezuelans|Venezuelan]] migrants who were primarily of [[Amerindian]], [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Mestizo]], [[Pardo]], and [[Afro-Venezuelan|African]] heritage, something which is strongly reflected in the music itself. The word is derived from two Spanish words: ''parranda'', meaning \"a spree‚Äù, and ''parar'' meaning \"to stop\".\n\nIn the past, it was traditional for parang serenaders to pay nocturnal visits to the homes of family and friends, where part of the fun was waking the inhabitants of the household from their beds. Today, parang is especially vibrant in Trinidad and Tobago communities such as [[Paramin]], [[Lopinot]], and [[Arima]].\n\nA new form of parang, soca parang, has emerged. '''Soca parang''' is a combination of [[Soca music|soca]] and parang."
