  "description": "The '''joropo''', better known as '''Música Llanera''', is a [[musical style]] resembling the [[fandango]], and an accompanying dance. It originated in the [[Llanos]] of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] 300 years ago and it has [[African music|African]], [[Culture of Europe#Art|European]] and Native South American influences. There are different joropo variants: tuyero, oriental, and llanero. It is a fundamental genre of Venezuelan ''música criolla''. It is also the most popular \"folk rhythm\": the well-known song \"[[Alma Llanera]]\" is a joropo, considered the unofficial national anthem of Venezuela.\n\nIn 1882 it became Venezuela's national dance and music. Formerly, the Spanish word {{lang|es|joropo}} meant \"a party\", but now it has come to mean a type of music and dance that identifies Venezuelans. In the 18th century, the [[llanero]]s started using the word {{lang|es|joropo}} instead of {{lang|es|fandango}}, which was used at the time for party and dance.\n\nIn 2025, UNESCO inscribed Venezuelan joropo on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.",
