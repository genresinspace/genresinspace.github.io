  "description": "'''Twee pop''' is a subgenre of [[indie pop]] characterised by its rejection of [[masculine]] conventions and association with [[feminism]]. Its lyrics often focus on love and are written from an innocent point of view. The genre emerged in the 1980s in the United Kingdom and United States and further developed during the 1990s and 2000s. It experienced a revival in popularity in the early 2020s.",
