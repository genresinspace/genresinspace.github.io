  "description": "'''Twee pop''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie pop]] that originally emerged in the United Kingdom during the mid-to late 1980s. The style has been described as \"excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental\" and initially rose to prominence through the ''[[NME]]'s'' [[C86]] cassette compilation, with ''[[AllMusic]]'' describing twee as \"simplicity and innocence\" as well as \"boy-girl harmonies, lovelorn lyrics, infectious melodies, and simple, unaffected performances\". \n\nThe scene was originally spearheaded by [[Sarah Records]] in the United Kingdom who housed acts such as [[the Field Mice]], [[Heavenly (British band)|Heavenly]] and [[the Orchids]], along with [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]] of [[Beat Happening]]'s [[K Records]] in the United States. The genre further developed during the 1990s and 2000s. In the 2020s, it experienced a revival in popularity amongst [[Gen Z]] on [[TikTok]] and [[Tumblr]], particularly its aesthetics.",
