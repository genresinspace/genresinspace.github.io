  "description": "'''Twee pop''' is a subgenre of [[indie pop]] that derives its name from the \"twee\" aesthetic, described as being \"excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental.\" The genre is typically marked by stylistic influences from [[shoegaze]], [[jangle pop]], and related forms of guitar-based alternative music, with vocal, lyrical, and melodic approaches emphasizing innocence, naivety, or nostalgia, often influenced by [[bubblegum pop]]. Soft vocal styles and male-female harmonies are often employed, and arrangements are frequently accented by keyboards, synthesizers, or stringed instruments.\n\nThe genre emerged in the 1980s in the United Kingdom and United States and further developed during the 1990s and 2000s. It experienced a revival in popularity in the early 2020s.",
