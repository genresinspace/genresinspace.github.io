  "description": "'''Twee pop''' is a subgenre of [[indie pop]] that derives its name from the \"twee\" aesthetic, described as being \"excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental.\" The genre is typically marked by stylistic influences from [[shoegaze]], [[jangle pop]], and related forms of guitar-based alternative music, with vocal, lyrical, and melodic approaches emphasizing innocence, naivety, or nostalgia, often influenced by [[bubblegum pop]]. Keyboards, synthesizers, or stringed instruments frequently accent arrangements, often employing soft vocal styles and male-female harmonies.\n\nThe genre emerged in the 1980s in the United Kingdom and United States and further developed during the 1990s and 2000s. It experienced a revival in popularity in the early 2020s.",
