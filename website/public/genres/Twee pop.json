  "description": "'''Twee pop''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie pop]] that originates from the 1986 ''[[NME]]'' compilation ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]''. Twee pop gets its name from the aesthetic of twee, which is known for its simplicity and childlike innocence. Some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, prominent [[independent record label]]s associated with twee pop were [[Sarah Records]] (in the UK) and [[K Records]] (in the US).\n\nTwee pop gained popularity in the 1990s and has seen a recent revival in the 2020s.",
