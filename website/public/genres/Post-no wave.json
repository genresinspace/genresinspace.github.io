  "description": "'''Post-no wave''' is a form of [[experimental rock]] music that emerged from, or drew its inspiration from, the [[no wave]] scene. It's considered to have arisen after the disintegration of the original scene in 1980, expanding beyond its [[New York City]] boundaries. It further differs from no wave by exploring new music genres, making use of modern technology and studio techniques, embracing [[Rock music|rock]] or [[funk]] idioms, a greater rhythmic complexity or a tongue-in-cheek nihilistic humor. As a result, post-no wave usually fuses the angular and deconstructive approach of its predecessor with a more song-oriented sound.\n\nSignificant examples of post-no wave bands can be found in the works from former scenesters and new acts that were shaped by no wave in the 1980s —like [[Rat at Rat R]], [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Swans (band)|Swans]]—, the ephemeral [[Chicago No Wave]] scene in the 1990s and a nebula of scattered artists since the 2000s —such as [[Erase Errata]], [[Talk Normal]], [[Liars (band)|Liars]] and [[Gilla Band]]—.",
