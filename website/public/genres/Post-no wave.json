  "description": "'''Post-no wave''' is a style and era of music that emerged from the original [[New York City]] [[no wave]] scene in the early to mid 1980s. It's considered to have arisen after the disintegration of the original scene in 1980, and encompasses an expansion of the scene in areas such as [[Chicago no wave|Chicago]] and [[Kansai no wave|Japan]]. It further differs from no wave by exploring new music genres, making use of modern technology and studio techniques, embracing [[Rock music|rock]] or [[funk]] idioms, a greater rhythmic complexity or a tongue-in-cheek nihilistic humor. As a result, post-no wave usually fuses the angular and deconstructive approach of its predecessor with a more song-oriented sound.\n\nSignificant examples of post-no wave bands can be found in the works from former scenesters and new acts that were shaped by no wave in the 1980s —like [[Rat at Rat R]], [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Swans (band)|Swans]]—, the ephemeral Chicago No Wave scene in the 1990s and a nebula of scattered artists since the 2000s such as [[Erase Errata]], [[Talk Normal]], [[Liars (band)|Liars]] and [[Gilla Band]].",
