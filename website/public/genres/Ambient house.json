  "description": "'''Ambient house''' is a [[downtempo]] subgenre of [[house music]] that first emerged in the late 1980s, combining elements of [[acid house]] and [[ambient music]]. The genre developed in [[chill-out]] rooms and specialist clubs as part of the UK's dance music scene. It was most prominently pioneered by [[the Orb]] and [[the KLF]], along with artists such as [[Global Communication]], [[Mixmaster Morris|Irresistible Force]], [[Youth (musician)|Youth]], and [[808 State]]. The term was used vaguely, and eventually fell out of favor as more specific subgenres were recognized."
