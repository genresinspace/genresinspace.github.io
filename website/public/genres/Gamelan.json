The most common instruments used are [[metallophone]]s (played with [[mallet]]s) and a set of hand-drums called ''[[kendang]]'', which keep the [[beat (music)|beat]]. The ''[[kemanak]]'', a banana-shaped [[idiophone]], and the ''[[gangsa]]'', another metallophone, are also commonly used gamelan [[Musical instrument|instruments]] on [[Bali]]. Other notable instruments include [[xylophone]]s, [[bamboo flute]]s (similar to the Indian ''[[bansuri]]''), a bowed [[string instrument]] called a ''[[rebab]]'' (somewhat similar to the ''[[gadulka]]'' of [[Bulgaria]]), and a [[zither]]-like instrument called a ''[[siter]]'', used in Javanese gamelan. Additionally, vocalists may be featured, being referred to as ''[[sindhen]]'' for females or ''[[gerong]]'' for males.\n\nAlthough the popularity of gamelan has declined slightly since the introduction of modern popular music to Indonesia, the art form is still widely respected, being commonly played in many traditional ceremonies. It may also be performed as entertainment for some modern events, such as official cultural, corporate, government or educational functions, both formal or informal. Gamelan is also, traditionally, arranged and performed to accompany religious [[ritual]]s, [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], [[dance]] theatre, [[Wayang wong|dance-drama]], traditional Indonesian [[theater]], [[Wayang|wayang puppets theatre]], [[singing]], [[concert]]s, [[festivals]], [[exhibitions]], and many more. Many consider gamelan to be an integral part of [[Indonesian culture]].\n\nIn 2014, Gamelan traditions were recognized as part of the [[National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia]] by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture]].\n\nOn 15 December 2021, Gamelan was inscribed onto the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]. The nomination builds on the archaeological connection to the [[Borobudur]], and includes a focus on its role in fostering a sense of national identity and pride, in addition to wellbeing aspects such as mental health, the development of interpersonal skills and the connection between its cosmology and an ethics of mutual respect and care. The listing consists of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] gamelan (gamelan jawa) of [[Central Java]] and [[Special Region of Yogyakarta]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]] gamelan (gamelan bali) of [[Bali]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] gamelan (gamelan sunda) of [[West Java]], [[Madurese people|Madurese]] gamelan (gamelan madura) and [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangian]] Gamelan (gamelan banyuwangi) of [[East Java]], [[Gendang beleq]] of [[West Nusa Tenggara]], [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] gamelan (gamelan banjar) of [[South Kalimantan]], Gamelan peking of [[Lampung]], and [[Talempong]] of [[West Sumatra]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] from [[Indonesia]], and encouraged the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government to safeguard, transmit, promote, and develop the gamelan.
