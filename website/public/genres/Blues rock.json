  "description": "'''Blues rock''' is a fusion [[music genre|genre]] and form of [[rock music|rock]] and [[blues]] music that relies on the chords/scales and instrumental improvisation of [[blues]]. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock (electric guitar, electric bass guitar, drums, and sometimes with keyboards and harmonica). From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced [[hard rock]], [[Southern rock]], and early [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\nBlues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric [[Chicago blues]] songs, such as those by [[Willie Dixon]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Jimmy Reed]], at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Yardbirds]], and [[the Animals]], who put several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, [[Lonnie Mack]], the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], and [[Canned Heat]] were among the earliest exponents. Some of these bands also played long, involved improvisations as were then commonplace on jazz records. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the style became more hard rock-oriented. In the US, [[Johnny Winter]], the early [[Allman Brothers Band]], and [[ZZ Top]] represented a hard rock trend, along with [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Chicken Shack]], and [[Foghat]] in the UK.\n\nAlong with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on [[album-oriented rock]] radio in the United States, and later the [[classic rock]] format established there during the 1980s.",
