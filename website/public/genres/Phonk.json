The genre is characterized by its use of vintage Memphis rap vocals, [[chopped and screwed]] production techniques, and [[Sampling (music)|samples]] from early 1990s hip hop, often combined with samples from [[jazz music|jazz]] and [[funk]].\n\nThe genre emerged in the [[Southern United States]] during the 1990s, with pioneers like [[DJ Screw]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], and [[DJ Spanish Fly]] laying its groundwork. The term \"phonk\" was popularized in the early 2010s by rapper and producer [[SpaceGhostPurrp]], who described it as a modern take on [[funk]]-inspired hip hop.\n\nIn the late 2010s, a subgenre called drift phonk emerged in Russia, distinguished by its heavy use of [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], aggressive [[Bassline|basslines]], and faster tempos. Gaining widespread popularity through social media platforms like [[TikTok]], drift phonk became synonymous with the broader phonk genre, often overshadowing its original sound.",
