  "description": "'''Experimental pop''' is [[pop music]] that cannot be categorized within traditional musical boundaries{{sfn|Landy|1994|p=100}}{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=200}} or which attempts to push elements of existing popular forms into new areas.{{sfn|Martin|2015|pp=4–5}} It may incorporate [[experimental music|experimental techniques]] such as [[musique concrète]], [[aleatoric music]], or [[eclecticism in music|eclecticism]] into pop contexts.{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=199}} Often, the compositional process involves the use of [[electronic music|electronic]] production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements,{{sfn|Johnson|2009|p=200}} and the composer may draw the listener's attention specifically with both [[timbre]] and [[tonality]], though not always simultaneously.{{sfn|Landy|2012|p=14}}\n\nExperimental pop music developed concurrently with [[experimental jazz]] as a new kind of [[avant-garde]], with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of [[popular music]]. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with [[musical form]], [[orchestration]], [[reverb|unnatural reverb]], and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences.",
