  "description": "'''Stadium house''' is a genre of dance music which was most successful in the early 1990s. Acts such as [[the KLF]] and [[Utah Saints]] combined house music with other elements more typical in [[rock music]], such as bombastic live shows and even guitarists, to add additional impact to their music and appearance, in order to fill large venues and drive audience participation, or convey a live atmosphere in their recordings. Artists in this genre typically made heavy use of samples, and frequently sampled crowd noise for use in their music.\n\nThe term was made popular by the KLF, who released a video collection called ''The Stadium House Trilogy'' covering three of their videos. KLF member [[Bill Drummond]] himself referred to [[Utah Saints]] as \"the first true stadium house band\".\n\nArtists frequently classified in this genre include:\n\n* [[The KLF]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN7o7lmbp8Y|title=Rapido TV - The KLF|website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izm8vJbuwGM|title=The KLF return after 23 year absence â€“ Channel 4 News 23/08/2017|website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n* [[Utah Saints]]\n* [[Faithless]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/faithless-no-roots|title=Faithless - No Roots|date=6 June 2004 }}</ref>\n* [[The Prodigy]]\n* [[Basement Jaxx]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicismthought.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/the-secret-history-of-basement-jaxx/|title=The secret history of Basement Jaxx|date=7 July 2016 }}</ref>\n* [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.supajam.com/blog/article/Bands-changing-direction|title=Bands changing direction}}</ref>\n* [[The Chemical Brothers]]\n* [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]]\n* [[2 Unlimited]]",
