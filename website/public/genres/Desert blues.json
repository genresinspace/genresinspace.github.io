  "description": "'''Tishoumaren''' (ⵜⵉⵛⵓⵎⴰⵔⴻⵏ in [[Neo-Tifinagh]] script) or '''assouf''', internationally known as '''desert blues''', is a style of music from the [[Sahara]] region of [[North Africa|northern]] and [[west Africa]]. Critics describe the music as a fusion of [[blues]] and [[rock music]] with [[Tuareg music|Tuareg]], [[Music of Mali|Malian]] or [[North African music]]. Various other terms are used to describe it including '''desert rock''', '''Saharan rock''', [[Takamba]], '''Mali blues''', '''Tuareg rock''' or simply \"guitar music\". The style has been pioneered by [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] musicians in the [[Sahara]] region, particularly in [[Music of Mali|Mali]], [[Music of Niger|Niger]], [[Music of Libya|Libya]], [[Music of Algeria|Algeria]], [[Music of Burkina Faso|Burkina Faso]] and others; with it also being developed by [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] artists in [[Music of Western Sahara|Western Sahara]].\n\nThe musical style took shape as an expression of the culture of the traditionally nomadic [[Tuareg people]], amid their difficult sociopolitical situation, including [[Tuareg rebellion (disambiguation)|rebellions]], widespread displacement and exile in [[decolonisation of Africa|post-colonial Africa]]. The word ''Tishoumaren'' is derived from the French word ''[[wikt:chômeur|chômeur]]'', meaning \"the unemployed\".\n\nThe genre was first pioneered by and popularized outside of Africa by [[Ali Farka Touré]] and later [[Tinariwen]]. In recent years, artists like [[Mdou Moctar]] and [[Bombino (musician)|Bombino]] have continued to adapt Saharan rock music and have achieved international success.",
