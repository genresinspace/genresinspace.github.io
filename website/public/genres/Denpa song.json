  "description": "A {{nihongo|'''''denpa'' song'''|電波ソング}} is a type of Japanese music that is intentionally strange and catchy. Common features of ''denpa'' songs include intentionally off-key vocals, nonsensical lyrics, and an over-the-top tune. ''Denpa'' music has grown into a subculture within Japan, forming a significant aspect of [[otaku]] culture, and has large numbers of ''[[Dōjin music|dōjin]]'' circles and music artists dedicated to ''denpa'' music. ''Denpa'' is not a specific [[Music genre|genre]] in itself, but rather an umbrella term for various kinds of music.\n\nAlternative terms for ''denpa'' music coined in recent times include '''Akiba-pop''' (i.e. \"pop of [[Akihabara]]\") and '''A-pop'''. The term {{nihongo|\"''[[Moe (slang)|Moe]]'' song\"|萌えソング}} specifically refers to ''denpa'' music of otaku origin featuring ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' themes.",
