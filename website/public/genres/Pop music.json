  "description": "'''Pop music''', or simply '''pop''', is a genre of [[popular music]] that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed [[rock and roll]] and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. [[Rock music|Rock]] and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which ''pop'' became associated with music that was more commercial, [[wikt:ephemeral|ephemeral]], and accessible.\n\nIdentifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and [[Hook (music)|hooks]], short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the [[verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much of pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as [[Rock music|rock]], [[hip hop]], [[urban contemporary|urban]], [[dance music|dance]], [[Latin music|Latin]], and [[country music|country]].\n\nThe terms ''popular music'' and ''pop music'' are often used interchangeably, as the former also describes ''all'' music that is targeted for mass appeal (compare [[art music]]) and includes many disparate styles.",
