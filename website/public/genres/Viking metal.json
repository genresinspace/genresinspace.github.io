  "description": "'''Viking metal''' is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on [[Norse mythology]], [[Norse religion|Norse paganism]], and the [[Viking Age]]. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically heard as [[black metal]] with influences from [[Nordic folk music]]. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy [[Ostinato#Riff|riffing]] style, [[anthem]]ic choruses, use of both sung and [[harsh vocals]], a reliance on [[folk instrument]]ation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.\n\nViking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an [[Anti-Christian sentiment#Europe|opposition to Christianity]], but rejecting [[Satanism]] and [[occult|occult themes]] in favor of the [[Vikings]] and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|paganism]]. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to [[pagan metal]], but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the [[Nordic countries]], and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and [[folk metal]] genres as part of the broader [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan movements]], as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.\n\nThough artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Heavy Load (band)|Heavy Load]], [[Manowar]], and many others had previously dealt with Viking themes, [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with ''[[Hordanes Land]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'' (1994). [[Burzum]], [[Emperor (Norwegian band)|Emperor]], [[Einherjer]], and [[Helheim (band)|Helheim]], among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band [[Falkenbach]], Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] heritage and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The [[death metal]] bands [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], [[Amon Amarth]], and [[Ensiferum]], which emerged in the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.",
