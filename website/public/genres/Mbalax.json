  "description": "'''Mbalax''' (or '''mbalakh''') is the urban dance music of [[Senegal]], [[Mauritania]] and [[the Gambia]]. The musical style is rooted in the indigenous instrumental and vocal styles accompanied by [[Polyrhythm|polyrhythmic]] sabar drumming of the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], a social identity that includes both the original Wolof people of the Greater [[Senegambia]] region and the urban panethnic identity that arose during [[colonialism]]. \n\nA cultural value proved by Wolof is their one's and respect of other cultural and musical practices. Therefore the origins of mbalax include a fusion of Wolof, Soce, and  [[Serer people|Serer]] music, rhythms, and instrumentation. The Wolof ability to include the diverse styles from Senegambian groups has allowed the sabar and its modern music formation to thrive. It is not uncommon, for example, for a sabar event to include music of the Serer such as the [[njuup]], which is connected to sacred [[ndut initiation rite|ndut rite ceremonies]]. In this way many ethnic groups may participate and the inclusion also increases the accessibility and popularity of the genre. \n\nIn the 1970s, mbalax arose as Senegalese fused indigenous music styles with urban dance music from the African diaspora, the West, and the continent.  These foreign sounds included U.S. [[soul music|soul]], jazz, and salsa. Afro Cuban musics from the diaspora, Congolese rumba, and [[rock music|rock]] were also fused with the rhythms of ''[[sabar]] t''hat were now played on the electric bass, guitar and keyboards.",
