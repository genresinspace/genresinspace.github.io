  "description": "'''Low bap''' is a subgenre of the [[Greece|Greek]] [[hip hop music]] scene that emerged in the mid-1990s as the sound of the prominent Greek hip hop group [[Active Member]]. It is characterized by slower [[tempo]] and [[rapping]] than usual, often combined with lyrics with sociopolitical content. The words \"low bap\" is derived from the [[boom bap]] hip hop subgenre from the East Coast of the United States. Cinematic attempts, concerts, and festivals have also taken place in an effort to broaden the scope of the movement, and introduce new bands to the genre's range of followers.\n\nLow bap has its beginnings in [[Perama]], an industrial suburb of [[Piraeus]] in [[Athens Urban Area]].",
