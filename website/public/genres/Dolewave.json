  "description": "'''Dolewave''' is an [[Australian music]] genre that emerged in the early 2010s. Initially used online as an in-joke to describe an [[Music of Melbourne#Independent scene|indie scene]] in [[Melbourne]] involving [[Twerps (band)|Twerps]], [[Dick Diver]] and other groups, the term has since been applied by music critics to a wider range of Australian acts that share a [[DIY ethic]] and a \"peculiarly and recognisably Australasian sound\", such as [[Courtney Barnett]] and [[Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever]]. Common influences include the 1980s [[jangle pop]] of Australian bands such as [[the Go-Betweens]], as well as the lo-fi \"[[Dunedin sound]]\" of New Zealand's [[Flying Nun Records|Flying Nun]] record label.",
