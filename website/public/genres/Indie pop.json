  "description": "'''Indie pop''' (also typeset as '''indie-pop''' or '''indiepop''') is a music genre and subculture that combines [[<!--- Source states \"guitar pop\" not \"indie pop\" or \"pop rock\"---->guitar pop]] with a [[DIY ethic]] in opposition to the style and tone of mainstream [[pop music]].{{sfn|Frith|Horne|2016|p=139}} It originated from British [[post-punk]] in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving [[fanzine]], [[Independent record label|label]], and club and gig circuit. Compared to its counterpart, [[indie rock]], the genre is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. In later years, the definition of ''indie pop'' has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings. Subgenres include [[chamber pop]] and [[twee pop]].",
