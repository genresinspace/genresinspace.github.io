  "description": "A '''narcocorrido''' ({{IPA|es|naɾkokoˈriðo}}, \"narco-corrido\" or ''drug ballad'') is a subgenre of the [[Regional Mexican]] [[corrido]] (narrative ballad) genre, from which several other genres have evolved. This type of music is heard and produced on both sides of the [[Mexico–US border]]. It uses a danceable, [[polka]], [[waltz]] or [[mazurka]] rhythmic base.\n\nThe first corridos that focus on [[Illegal drug trade|drug smugglers]]&mdash;the ''narco'' comes from \"[[narcotic]]s\"&mdash;have been dated by Juan Ramírez-Pimienta to the 1930s. Early corridos (non-narco) go back as far as the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910, telling the stories of revolutionary fighters. Music critics have also compared narcocorrido [[lyrics|lyrics and style]] to [[gangster rap]] and [[mafioso rap]].\n\nNarcocorrido lyrics refer to particular events and include real dates and places. The lyrics tend to speak approvingly of illegal activities, mainly drug trafficking.",
