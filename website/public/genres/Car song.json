  "description": "A '''car song''' is a song with lyrics or musical themes pertaining to car travel. Though the earliest forms appeared in the 1900s, car songs emerged in full during the 1950s as part of [[rock and roll]] and [[car culture]], but achieved their peak popularity in the [[West Coast of the United States]] during the 1960s with the emergence of [[hot rod rock]] as an outgrowth of the [[surf music]] scene. Though this popularity declined by the late 1960s, cars remain a frequently used subject matter in pop music into the 21st century.",
