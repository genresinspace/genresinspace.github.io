  "description": "'''Riot grrrl''' is an [[Underground music|underground]] feminist [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement that began during the early 1990s within the United States in [[Olympia, Washington]], and the greater [[Pacific Northwest]], and has expanded to at least 26 other countries. A [[subcultural]] movement that combines [[feminism]], punk music, and politics, it is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]], which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the riot grrrl movement and has recently been seen in [[fourth-wave feminist]] punk music that rose in the 2010s. It has also been described as a genre that came out of [[indie rock]], with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a movement in which women could express anger, rage, and frustration, emotions considered socially acceptable for male songwriters but less commonly for women.\n\nRiot grrrl songs often address issues such as [[rape]], [[domestic abuse]], [[sexuality]], [[racism]], [[patriarchy]], [[classism]], [[anarchism]], and [[female empowerment]]. Primary bands most associated with the movement by media include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Slant 6]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Jack Off Jill]] and [[Skinned Teen]]. Also included are [[queercore]] groups such as [[Team Dresch]] and [[The Third Sex (band)|the Third Sex]].\n\nIn addition to a unique music scene and genre, riot grrrl became a subculture involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism. The movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to influence the vibrant zine- and Internet-based nature of fourth-wave feminism, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end [[intersectional]] forms of prejudice and oppression, especially physical and emotional violence against all genders.",
