  "description": "'''Fado''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈfaðu}}; \"destiny, fate\") is a [[music genre]] which can be traced to the 1820s in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], but probably has much earlier origins. Fado historian and scholar Rui Vieira Nery states that \"the only reliable information on the history of fado was orally transmitted and goes back to the 1820s and 1830s at best. But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.\"\n\nAlthough the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is commonly regarded as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain traditional structure. In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a sense of resignation, fate and melancholy. This is loosely captured by the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''[[saudade]]'', or longing, symbolizing a feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). This is similar to the character of several musical genres in Portuguese ex-colonies such as [[Morna (music)|morna]] from [[Cape Verde]], which may be historically linked to fado in its earlier form and have retained its rhythmic heritage. This connection to the music of a historic Portuguese urban and maritime [[proletariat]] (sailors, bohemians, dock workers, prostitutes, taverna frequenters, port traders, fishwives and other [[working-class]] people) can also be found in Brazilian [[modinha]] and Indonesian [[kroncong]], although all these music genres subsequently developed their own independent traditions.\n\nSome famous singers of fado, of which there are many, include [[Alfredo Marceneiro]], [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Mariza]], [[António Zambujo]], and [[Camané]]. On 27 November 2011, fado was added to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]]. It is one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the lists, the other being [[Cante Alentejano]].\n\nModern fado is popular in Portugal, and has been performed by many renowned [[List of fado musicians|musicians]].",
