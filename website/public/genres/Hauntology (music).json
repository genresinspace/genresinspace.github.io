  "description": "'''Hauntology''' is a [[music genre]], movement or a loosely defined stylistic feature that evokes [[cultural memory]] and aesthetics of the past. It developed in the 2000s primarily among British [[electronic music]]ians, and typically draws on British cultural sources from the 1930s to the 1960s, including [[library music]], film and TV [[soundtrack]]s, [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[public information films]]; often through the use of [[sample (music)|sampling]].\n\nThe term was derived from philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[hauntology|concept of the same name]]. In the mid-2000s, it was adapted by theorists [[Simon Reynolds]] and [[Mark Fisher]]. Hauntology is associated with the UK record labels [[Ghost Box]] and [[Trunk Records]], in addition to artists such as [[The Caretaker (musician)|the Caretaker]], [[Burial (musician)|Burial]], and [[Philip Jeck]]. Music genres [[hypnagogic pop]] and [[chillwave]] descended from hauntology.",
