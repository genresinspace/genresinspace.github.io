  "description": "'''Punk rock''' (also known as '''punk''') is a subgenre of [[rock music]] that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s [[rock and roll]] and 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the overproduction and corporate nature of mainstream rock music. Typically producing short, fast-paced songs with rough stripped-down vocals and instrumentation, artists embrace a [[DIY ethic]] with many bands self-producing and distributing recordings through [[independent record label|independent label]]s.  \n\nDuring the early 1970s, the term \"punk rock\" was originally used by some American rock critics to describe mid-1960s garage bands. Subsequent developments such as [[glam rock]] and [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] in the UK, alongside [[the Velvet Underground]] and [[the New York Dolls]] from New York have been cited as key influences. By the mid 1970s, the term \"punk rock\" had become associated with several regional underground music scenes, including the [[MC5]] and [[Iggy and the Stooges]] in Detroit; [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]], [[the Dictators]], [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; [[Rocket from the Tombs]], [[Electric Eels (band)|Electric Eels]], [[Devo]] and [[Dead Boys]] in [[Cleveland punk|Ohio]]; [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] and [[Radio Birdman]] in [[Punk rock in Australia|Australia]]; and the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] and the [[Buzzcocks]] in England. By late 1976, punk had become a major cultural phenomenon in the UK, giving rise to a [[punk subculture]] that expressed youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing]], such as T-shirts with deliberately offensive graphics, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands, jewelry, bondage clothing and safety pins. \n\nBy 1977, the influence of punk music and its associated subculture spread worldwide, taking root in a wide range of local scenes. The movement later proliferated into various subgenres during the late 1970s, giving rise to movements such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and [[art punk]]. By the early 1980s, punk experienced further diversification with subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g  [[Bad Brains]], [[Minor Threat]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]); [[Oi!]], (e.g [[Sham 69]] and [[the Exploited]]); [[street punk]] (eg. [[GBH (band)|GBH]], [[The Partisans (band)|the Partisans]], and [[Chaos UK]]); and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g [[Crass]]). The movement later expanded with the development of [[pop-punk]], [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], and [[alternative rock]]. \n\nFollowing alternative rock's mainstream breakthrough in the 1990s through the success of bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], punk rock saw renewed major-label interest and mainstream appeal exemplified by the rise of  Californian bands [[Green Day]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Blink-182]], and [[NOFX]].",
