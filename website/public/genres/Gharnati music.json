  "description": "'''Gharnati''' ([[Arabic]]: الغرناطي), refers to an [[Algeria|Algerian]] variety of [[Andalusian classical music]] originating in [[Tlemcen]]. Its name is derived from the Arabic name of the city of [[Granada]]. Gharnati has also become an established tradition in other cities in western Algeria, such as [[Oran]] and [[Sidi-Bel-Abbès]]. In the 20th century it also spread to [[Morocco]] after being brought over by Algerian families who moved there fleeing French colonial rule in Algeria, and eventually founding conservatories in cities like [[Oujda]] and [[Rabat]].",
