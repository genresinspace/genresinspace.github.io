  "description": "'''Synthwave''' (also called '''retrowave''', or '''futuresynth''') is an [[electronic music]] [[microgenre]] that is based predominantly on the music associated with the [[Film score|film soundtracks]] of [[action film]]s, [[science fiction films]], and [[horror films]] of the 1980s. Other influences are drawn from the decade's art and [[1980s in video games|video games]]. Synthwave musicians often espouse [[1980s nostalgia|nostalgia for 1980s culture]] and attempt to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.\n\nThe genre developed in the mid-to late 2000s through [[French house]] producers, as well as younger artists who were inspired by the 2002 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]''. Other reference points included composers [[John Carpenter]], [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Vangelis]] (especially his score for the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]''), and [[Tangerine Dream]]. Synthwave reached wider popularity after being featured in the soundtracks of the 2011 film ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (which included some of the genre's best-known songs), the 2012 video game ''[[Hotline Miami]]'' as well as its [[Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number|2015 sequel]], the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', and the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Stranger Things]]''.",
