Russefeiring is a way for students in Norway to celebrate their completion of thirteen years of schooling. The celebration traditionally starts between April 20th and May 1st, depending on the specific town or county, and continues until Norwayâ€™s National Day on May 17th.  .\n\nRuss' music has lately been labeled as a controversial genre as a part of a constantly growing market. [[Record producer]]s are heavily criticized for their use of explicit lyrics, as the distribution of russ music has grown to be an independent [[music industry]] in Norway.",
