  "description": "'''Christian metal''', also known as '''white metal''', '''Jesus metal,''' or '''heavenly metal''', is [[heavy metal music]] distinguished by its Christian-themed song lyrics and the dedication of the band-members to [[Christianity]]. Christian metal is typically performed by professed [[Christians]], principally for Christians and is often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.\n\n[[List of Christian metal artists|Christian metal bands]] exist in most of the [[list of heavy metal genres|subgenres]] of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal [[subculture]] provides its core members with an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith, although it often does.\n\nChristian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of [[Evangelism|evangelization]] to the wider heavy metal music scene. The genre was pioneered by the American [[Resurrection Band]] and [[Barnabas (band)|Barnabas]], the Swedish [[Jerusalem (Swedish band)|Jerusalem]], and Canadian [[Daniel Band]].{{sfn|Thompson|2000|pp=153–4}} In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as [[Vengeance Rising]], [[Deliverance (metal band)|Deliverance]], [[Believer (band)|Believer]], and [[Tourniquet (band)|Tourniquet]].{{sfn|Moberg|2015|pp=37–8}} Another Christian metal band that was successful during the '80s was American band [[Stryper]], whose album ''[[To Hell with the Devil]]'' sold over two million copies.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Australian [[death metal]] band [[Mortification (band)|Mortification]] rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene. At the turn of the 21st century, having released two platinum-selling albums, [[P.O.D.]] achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper.{{sfn|Moberg|2015|pp=39}} The [[metalcore]] groups [[Underoath]] (2002-2018), [[Demon Hunter (band)|Demon Hunter]], [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], and [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]] (dubbed \"The Holy Alliance\" by [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver Magazine]]) also brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].",
