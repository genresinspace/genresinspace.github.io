  "description": "'''Glitch''' is a genre of [[Experimental music|experimental]] [[electronic music]] that emerged in the 1990s, which is distinguished by the deliberate use of [[glitch]]es in audio media and other [[sonic artifact]]s.\n\nThe sounds featured in glitch tracks usually come from [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recording]] device or [[digital electronics]] malfunctions, such as [[Compact disc|CD]] [[Skip (audio playback)#Compact Discs|skipping]], [[Mains hum|electric hum]], digital or analog [[distortion]], [[circuit bending]], [[Data compression|bit-rate reduction]], hardware [[Noise (electronics)|noise]], [[software bug]]s, [[Crash (computing)|computer crashes]], [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] hiss or scratches, and system errors, as well as abstract [[sound design]] produced from the intended use of these technologies. Devices that were already broken are often used, while other times devices are broken expressly for this purpose. In ''[[Computer Music Journal]]'', composer and writer [[Kim Cascone]] classified glitch as a subgenre of [[electronica]] and used the term ''post-digital'' to describe the glitch aesthetic.",
