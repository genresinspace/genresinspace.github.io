  "description": "'''Japanese hip hop''' is [[hip hop music]] from [[Japan]]. It is said to have begun when [[Hiroshi Fujiwara]] returned to Japan and started playing hip hop records in the early 1980s. Japanese hip hop tends to be most directly influenced by [[old school hip hop]], taking from the era's catchy beats, [[hip hop dance|dance culture]] and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan and the line between it and [[pop music]] is frequently blurred.",
