  "description": "'''Hard bop''' is a subgenre of [[jazz]] that is an extension of [[bebop]] (or \"bop\") music. Journalists and record companies began using the term in the mid-1950s to describe a new current within jazz that incorporated influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music]], and [[blues]], especially in [[saxophone]] and [[piano]] playing.\n\n[[David H. Rosenthal]] contends in his book ''Hard Bop'' that the genre is, to a large degree, the natural creation of a generation of [[African-American]] musicians who grew up at a time when bop and [[rhythm and blues]] were the dominant forms of black American music.{{Rp|24}} Prominent hard bop musicians included [[Horace Silver]], [[Clifford Brown]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], [[Miles Davis]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Pat Martino]] and others.{{According to whom|date=January 2025}}",
