  "description": "'''Chamber pop''' (also called [[baroque pop]] and sometimes conflated with [[orchestral pop]] or symphonic pop) is a music genre that combines [[rock music]] with the intricate use of [[string section|strings]], [[horn section|horn]]s, [[piano]], and [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]], and other components drawn from the orchestral and [[lounge music|lounge]] pop of the 1960s, with an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[texture (music)|texture]].\n\nDuring chamber pop's initial emergence in the 1960s, producers such as [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], [[Burt Bacharach]], [[Lee Hazlewood]], and [[the Beach Boys]]' [[Brian Wilson]] served as formative artists of the genre. Wilson's productions of [[the Beach Boys]]' albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' and ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' are cited as particularly influential to the genre. From the early 1970s to early 1990s, most chamber pop acts saw little to no mainstream success. The genre's decline was attributed to costly touring and recording logistics and a reluctance among [[record label]]s to finance instruments like strings, horns, and keyboards on artists' albums.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, chamber pop developed as a subgenre of [[indie rock]]{{sfn|Tonelli|2004|p=3}} or [[indie pop]] in which musicians opposed the [[distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars, [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic, and simple arrangements common to the [[alternative rock|alternative]] or \"[[modern rock]]\" groups of that era. In Japan, the movement was paralleled by ''[[Shibuya-kei]]'', another indie genre that was formed on some of the same bedrock of influences. By the 2000s, the term \"chamber pop\" would be inconsistently applied to a variety of bands whose work attracted comparisons to ''Pet Sounds''."
