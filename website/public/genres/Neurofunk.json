  "description": "'''Neurofunk''' (also known informally as '''neuro''') is a dark subgenre of [[drum and bass]] which emerged between 1997 and 1998 in [[London]], [[England]] as a [[Progressive dance music|progression]] of [[techstep]].\n\nIt was further developed by juxtaposing elements of darker, heavier, and harder forms of [[funk]] with multiple influences ranging from [[techno]], [[House music|house]] and [[jazz]], distinguished by consecutive [[Stab (music)|stabs]] over the [[bassline]]; razor-sharp [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeats]]; scarce or nonexistent traditional melodies; a hyper focus on sub sound design; the use of modulated, distorted and filtered [[synthesizer]]s and audio capture from [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] such as the [[Akai S1000]] and [[E-mu Emulator|Emu E6400]]."
