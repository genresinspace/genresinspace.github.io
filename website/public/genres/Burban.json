  "description": "'''Burban''' ([[portmanteau]] of \"brown urban\") is a musical sub-culture and an attempt to unify urban musicians of [[British Asian|Asian]] descent. The idea has caused a split amongst the bigger artists and critics due to the ambiguity of the term itself. The common misconception of burban is that it is a musical genre of Asian origin, which is incorrect. Burban is a sub-culture of hip hop/R&B music, focused on artists of Asian background. The reason behind this was to abolish the term \"urban desi\", which commonly pigeon-holed hip hop artists as '[[desi]]' artists.",
