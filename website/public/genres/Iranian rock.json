  "description": "'''Iranian rock''' (also known as '''Rocka red''') refers to [[rock music]] produced by [[Iran]]ian artists. Rock music has been popular in Iran since 1960s, with the emergence of singers such as [[Kourosh Yaghmaei]], [[Farhad Mehrad]], [[Fereydoon Forooghi|Fereydoon Foroughi]] and [[Habib (singer)|Habib Mohebian]], but was largely forgotten after the [[Iranian Revolution]]. Like most rock styles, electric guitar and bass guitar and drums are the main instruments in this type of music. In some groups, keyboard and piano are very important.\n\nIranian rock music is influenced by [[British rock music|English rock]], [[American rock]] and European styles. Because of the Iranian performers of this music, various types of Iranian rhythms and tones in this genre are separated from other rock genres. Iranian rock was banned after the Islamic revolution of 1979, and apart from a small number of artists, this style of music still has many problems in Iran.",
