  "description": "'''UK garage''', abbreviated as '''UKG''', is a genre of [[electronic music]] which originated in [[England]] in the early to mid-1990s.  It is defined by percussive, shuffled rhythms with [[syncopation|syncopated]] hi-hats, cymbals, and snares, and may include either 4/4 [[house music|house]] kick patterns or more irregular \"[[2-step garage|2-step]]\" rhythms. Garage tracks also commonly feature \"chopped up\" and [[Audio time stretching and pitch scaling|time-stretched]] or [[pitch shift|pitch-shifted]] vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 130 BPM. The genre was influenced by [[garage house]], [[jungle music|jungle]], Jamaican [[Sound system (Jamaican)|soundsystem]], [[ragga]], [[dancehall]], [[gospel music]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[rave]] culture.\n\nUK garage encompassed subgenres such as [[speed garage]] and [[2-step garage|2-step]], and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]], [[grime music|grime]], and [[dubstep]]. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of [[UK funky]], which is closely related. The 2010s saw a resurgence in the genre, then in the early 2020s, a revival of UK garage, sometimes titled \"new UK garage\" or \"NUKG\", was widely attributed to London-based producer Conducta and his record label Kiwi Rekords.",
