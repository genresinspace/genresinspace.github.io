  "description": "'''UK garage''', abbreviated as '''UKG''', is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] which originated in [[England]] in the early to mid-1990s. The genre was most clearly inspired by [[garage house]] and [[jungle music|jungle]] production methods, but also incorporates elements from [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]. It is defined by percussive, shuffled rhythms with [[syncopation|syncopated]] hi-hats, cymbals, and snares, and may include either 4/4 [[house music|house]] kick patterns or more irregular \"[[2-step garage|2-step]]\" rhythms. Garage tracks also commonly feature 'chopped up' and [[Audio time stretching and pitch scaling|time-stretched]] or [[pitch shift|pitch-shifted]] vocal samples complementing the underlying rhythmic structure at a tempo usually around 130 BPM.\n\nUK garage encompassed subgenres such as [[speed garage]] and [[2-step garage|2-step]], and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]], [[grime music|grime]], and [[dubstep]]. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of [[UK funky]], which is closely related. The 2010s saw a resurgence in the genre, then in the early 2020s, a revival of UK garage, sometimes titled \"new UK garage\" or \"NUKG\", was widely attributed to London-based producer Conducta and his record label Kiwi Rekords."
