  "description": "'''Plugg music''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[trap music]] that emerged in the mid-2010s via online distribution on the [[SoundCloud]] platform. It was popularized by melodic [[Southern hip hop]] artists, and is characterized by deep [[Roland-808|808]] basslines, sparkly melodies, and melodic vocals.\n\nUnlike mainstream [[Trap music|trap]], which is defined by bombastic production and rattling [[hi-hat]] drum patterns, plugg is said to be dreamy, laidback, atmospheric, spacey, airy, and minimal. The genre is also described as having an overall lush and [[jazz]]y atmosphere; ethereal, luscious \nmulti-instrumental harmonies and melodies; sparse, disjointed, and relaxed drum programming with few hi-hats; and thick [[bassline]]s. Instead of the hi-hats in mainstream trap, plugg beats mainly employ beat skips, [[crash cymbal]]s, and punctuated accent [[snare drum|snares]] on half-beats. As described by a critic, plugg is best intended to be heard alone, \"experience[d] .. [in] the way it's intended: as a day-long trance in your isolated abode\".\n\nVocally, plugg ranges from instrumental beats without vocals, to songs with either [[rapping]] or mellow singing. Rapping [[Flow (rapping)|flow]]s used in plugg range from aggressive to relaxed and mellow.",
