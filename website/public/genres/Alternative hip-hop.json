  "description": "'''Alternative hip-hop''' (also known as '''alternative rap''' and '''experimental hip-hop''') is a subgenre of [[hip-hop]] music that encompasses a wide range of styles that are not typically identified as mainstream. [[AllMusic]] defines it as comprising \"hip-hop groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]], [[Miami bass|bass]], [[hardcore hip-hop|hardcore]], and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from [[funk]] and [[Pop rock|pop/rock]], as well as [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], and even [[Folk music|folk]].\"\n\nAlternative hip-hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition during the early to mid-1990s. While some groups such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] and the [[Fugees]] achieved commercial success, many alternative rap acts tend to be embraced by [[alternative rock]] listeners rather than hip-hop or [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.  The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the simultaneous emergence of significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]]. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the [[digital era]] with a rejuvenated interest in [[independent music]] by the general public.\n\nDuring the 2000s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as [[Outkast]] and [[Kanye West]]. The alternative hip-hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the [[Somali people|Somali]]-Canadian poet [[K'naan]] and the British artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Alternative hip-hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets. The most prominent alternative hip-hop acts include [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[De La Soul]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], [[the Pharcyde]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Death Grips]] and [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]]. During the 2010s, the development of alternative hip hop music continued with the internet era and the appearance of streaming services, with many artists taking a more \"experimental\" approach to hip hop music, such as [[ASAP Rocky]], [[Yung Lean]], [[Bladee]], [[Chief Keef]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[Lil Pump]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], [[Lil Peep]], and [[SpaceGhostPurrp]]. Playboi Carti's 2020 album ''[[Whole Lotta Red|Whole Lotta Red]]'', for example, is marked by this approach.",
