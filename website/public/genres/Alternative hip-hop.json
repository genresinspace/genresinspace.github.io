  "description": "'''Alternative hip-hop''' (also known as '''alternative rap''' or later '''backpack rap''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[hip-hop]] music primarily defined by artists who reject traditional rap stereotypes, particularly those popularized by [[gangsta rap]]. Originally emerging in the late 1980s to early 1990s [[Underground hip-hop|underground rap]] scene, the genre was spearheaded by the [[Native Tongues]] movement in the [[East Coast hip-hop|East Coast]] which included acts like the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[X Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Monie Love]], [[Queen Latifah]] and later [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Yasiin Bey|Mos Def]]. These artists emphasized positive-minded, good-natured [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] lyrics, while pioneering and popularizing the use of eclectic [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[jazz]]-influenced beats in hip-hop. Drawing influences from [[political hip-hop|political]], [[Political hip-hop#Conscious hip-hop|conscious]] and [[progressive rap]] artists such as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[Public Enemy]].   \n\nDuring the 1990s, the alternative hip-hop movement expanded with [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] artists which included [[the Pharcyde]], [[Digital Underground]], [[Souls of Mischief]], [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[Jurassic 5]], [[Styles of Beyond]] and [[Freestyle Fellowship]] as well as certain [[Southern hip-hop|Southern]] acts such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Goodie Mob]], and [[Outkast]]. The commercial and cultural momentum of the movement was impeded by the rise and popularity of West Coast gangsta rap, though experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition through the success of [[the Fugees]], De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Outkast and Arrested Development. The Native Tongues movement inspired later alt rap artists such as [[the Roots]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]], [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[Dead Prez]], [[Camp Lo]], [[Jean Grae]], [[Nappy Roots]], [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]], [[J Dilla]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[MF Doom]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and [[Kanye West]].  \n\nBy the 2000s to 2010s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream through the \"backpack rap\" movement, which included the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as [[Kanye West]]. The genre later evolved to encompass many different styles of [[Trap music|trap]]-based contemporary [[Underground hip-hop#Digital Age|underground]] and [[internet rap]] music, which later resulted in the commercial success of several [[Soundcloud rap]] artists.",
