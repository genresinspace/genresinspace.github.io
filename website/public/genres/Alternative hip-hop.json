  "description": "'''Alternative hip-hop''' (also known as '''alternative rap''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[hip-hop]] defined by artists who reject the genre's traditional stereotypes, particularly those popularized by [[old-school hip-hop]] and [[gangsta rap]]. Originally emerging in the mid-to-late 1980s, the style was spearheaded by the [[Native Tongues]] collective in the [[East Coast hip-hop|East Coast]] which included acts like the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[De La Soul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[X Clan]], [[Brand Nubian]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Monie Love]], [[Queen Latifah]] and later [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Yasiin Bey|Mos Def]]. These artists emphasized positive-minded, good-natured [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] lyrics, while pioneering and popularizing the use of eclectic [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[jazz]]-influenced beats in hip-hop, drawing influences from [[political hip-hop|political]], [[progressive rap|progressive]] and [[Political hip-hop#Conscious hip-hop|conscious hip-hop]] artists such as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[Public Enemy]].   \n\nDuring the 1990s, the alternative hip-hop movement expanded with [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] artists such as [[the Pharcyde]], [[Digital Underground]], [[Souls of Mischief]], [[Del the Funky Homosapien]], [[Jurassic 5]], [[Styles of Beyond]] and [[Freestyle Fellowship]] as well as certain [[Southern hip-hop|Southern]] acts which included [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Goodie Mob]], and [[Outkast]]. The commercial and cultural momentum of the movement was impeded by the rise and popularity of West Coast gangsta rap, though experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition through the success of [[the Fugees]], De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Outkast and Arrested Development. The Native Tongues movement inspired later alt rap artists such as [[the Roots]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Little Brother (group)|Little Brother]], [[Black Eyed Peas]], [[Dead Prez]], [[Camp Lo]], [[Jean Grae]], [[Nappy Roots]], [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]], [[J Dilla]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[MF Doom]], [[Pharrell Williams]], and [[Kanye West]].  \n\nBy the 2000s to 2010s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream through the \"[[backpack rap]]\" movement, which included the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as Kanye West and Lupe Fiasco. Other artists included [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], [[Atmosphere (group)|Atmosphere]], [[Aceyalone]], [[Dilated Peoples]] and [[The Alchemist (musician)|the Alchemist]]. Collectives such as [[Odd Future]] and [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]] emerged out of the movement, while alternative hip-hop evolved to encompass several [[Trap music|trap]]-based [[internet rap]] genres.",
