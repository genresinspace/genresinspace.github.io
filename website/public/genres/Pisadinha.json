  "description": "'''Pisadinha''' is a musical genre that emerged in the state of [[Bahia]].\n\nThe musical style emerged in the city of [[Monte Santo, Bahia|Monte Santo]] in the 2000s. Pisadinha is thus characterized by the simplicity of the union of the electronic keyboard with the voice, played on the walls (large sound structures).\n\nThe first artist to achieve national relevance with the step was singer [[Gusttavo Lima]] in 2013. Two years later, an Internet meme known as the \"Human Guitar\" was responsible for the expansion of the genre. In 2019, the genre was on the rise due to the high production and popularity of songs in the genre, due to the ease of production and nostalgia caused by the electronic elements of the style; Soon the style caught the attention of well-known artists, such as [[Wesley Safadão]] and [[Xand Avião]]. Safadão has supported the dissemination of pisadinha, including some songs of the rhythm in shows."
