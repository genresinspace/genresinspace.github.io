  "description": "'''[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]],  [[transgender]], and [[queer]]''' '''(LGBTQ)''' '''music''' is music that focuses on the experiences of [[Gender identity|gender]] and [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]] as a product of the broad [[gay liberation]] movement.\n\nLGBTQ music spans the entire spectrum of [[popular music]]. Lyricism and song content typically express the frustration, anxiety, and hope associated with non-normative sexual and gender identities, offering marginalized groups a vital platform for expression. Recently, popular music has \"provided an arena where marginalized voices can be heard and sexual identities shaped, challenged, and renegotiated\". Mainstream music has begun to reflect acceptance of LGBTQ musicianship. Some [[Gay icon|queer icons]] are openly queer identifying and have made impactful changes in the world for LGBTQ people. Others are [[Straight ally|straight allies]] that have expressed their support for the community.\n\nLGBTQ music can also refer to music that doesn't necessarily engage with queer themes, or is created by queer composers/producers, but is enjoyed by members of the LGBTQ community regardless. Much of the music created by straight queer icons is enjoyed in LGBTQ spaces, with artists such as [[Judy Garland]], [[CÃ©line Dion]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Madonna]], or [[Cher]], among others. Some performers, like [[Elton John]] and [[Lady Gaga]], are big activists for the LGBTQ community, winning the [[GLAAD Vanguard Award]] in 2019, and publicly thanking the LGBTQ community for their development of the house music genre at the 2023 [[Grammy Awards]].",
