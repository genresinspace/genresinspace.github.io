  "description": "'''Bećarac''' is a [[humor]]ous form of [[Folk music|folk]] [[song]], originally from rural [[Slavonia]], [[Croatia]] and eventually spreading into southern [[Hungary]] and the  [[Vojvodina]] region of [[Serbia]]. The root of the word comes from ''bećar'' ({{langx|tr|bekâr}}), meaning \"bachelor\", \"reveler\" or \"carouser\". Bećarci are always teasing, mocking and/or lascivious, and are usually sung by a male company at village parties (\"sijelo\" or \"kirvaj\" ([[kermesse (festival)|kermesse]])). However, they are also sung by women in equal footing, especially in kolo dance.",
