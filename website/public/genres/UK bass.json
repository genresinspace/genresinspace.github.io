  "description": "'''UK bass''', also called '''bass music''', is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] during the mid-2000s under the influence of diverse genres such as [[house music|house]], [[Grime (music genre)|grime]], [[dubstep]], [[future garage]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[UK funky]]. The term \"UK bass\" came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on percussive, [[bass (music)|bass]]-led [[rhythm]]. \n\nUK bass is sometimes conflated with [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]] or [[post-dubstep]]. It is not to be confused with the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]]-based genre [[Miami bass]], which is sometimes called \"bass music\" as well.",
