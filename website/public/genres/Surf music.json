  "description": "'''Surf music''' (also known as '''surf rock''', '''surf pop''', or '''surf guitar''') is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[rock music]] associated with [[surf culture]], particularly as found in  [[Southern California]]. It was especially popular from 1958 to 1964 in two major forms.{{sfn|Blair|2015|pp=7, 49, 119}} The first is '''instrumental surf''', distinguished by [[reverb]]-heavy [[electric guitar]]s played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, largely pioneered by [[Dick Dale]] and the Del-Tones. The second is '''vocal surf''', which took elements of the original surf sound and added [[vocal harmonies]], a movement led by [[the Beach Boys]].\n\nDick Dale developed the surf sound from [[instrumental rock]], where he added [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]] and [[Mexican music|Mexican]]  influences, a [[spring reverb]], and rapid alternate [[guitar picking|picking]] characteristics. His regional hit \"[[Let's Go Trippin']]{{-\"}}, in 1961, launched the surf music craze, inspiring many others to take up the approach.\n\nThe genre reached national exposure when it was represented by [[vocal group]]s such as the Beach Boys and [[Jan and Dean]].{{sfn|Blair|2015|pp=7, 49}} Dale was quoted on such groups: \"They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn't surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ... That was the difference ... the real surfing music is instrumental.\"{{sfn|Blair|2015|p=49}}\n\nAt the height of its popularity, surf music rivaled [[girl group]]s, [[Countrypolitan]], and [[Motown (music style)|Motown]] for the top American popular music trend. It is sometimes referred to interchangeably with the \"[[California sound]]\".{{sfn|Browne|Browne|1986|p=194}} During the later stages of the surf music craze, many of its groups started to write [[Car song|songs about cars and girls]]; this was later known as \"[[hot rod rock]]\".",
