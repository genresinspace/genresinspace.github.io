  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''City pop'''|シティ・ポップ|shiti poppu|lead=yes}} is a loosely defined form of [[Japanese pop music]] that emerged in the mid-1970s and peaked in popularity during the 1980s. It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's Western-influenced \"[[New Music (Japanese genre)|new music]]\", but came to include a range of styles—including [[funk]], [[disco]], [[R&B]], [[Adult-oriented rock (disambiguation)|AOR]], [[soft rock]], and [[boogie (genre)|boogie]]—that were associated with Japan's nascent [[economic boom]] and [[leisure class]]. It was identified with new technologies such as the [[Walkman]], cars with built-in [[cassette deck]]s and [[Car stereo|FM stereos]], and various [[electronic musical instruments]].\n\nThere is no consensus among scholars regarding the definition of city pop. In Japan, the term referred to music that projected an \"urban\" feel and whose target demographic was urbanites. Many city pop artists did not embrace Japanese influences, and instead largely drew from American funk, soft rock and boogie. Some songs feature [[tropical music|tropical]] flourishes or elements taken from [[disco]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Okinawan music|Okinawan]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[Caribbean music]]. \n\nThe singer-songwriter [[Tatsuro Yamashita]], one of the most successful city pop artists, is sometimes called the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#Y|\"king\" of city pop]]. The band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and its members are also credited for influencing the styles of mixing and arrangement that became central to the genre.\n\nCity pop lost its mainstream appeal after the 1980s and was derided by later Japanese generations. In the early 2010s, partly through the influence of music-sharing blogs and Japanese reissues, city pop gained an international online following and became important to the sample-based [[microgenre]]s known as [[vaporwave]] and [[future funk]].",
