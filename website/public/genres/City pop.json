  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''City pop'''|シティ・ポップ|shiti poppu|lead=yes}} is a loosely defined form of [[Japanese pop music]] that emerged in the late 1970s and peaked in popularity during the 1980s. It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's Western-influenced \"[[New Music (Japanese genre)|new music]]\", but came to include a wide range of styles — including [[funk]], [[disco]], [[R&B]], [[Adult-oriented rock (disambiguation)|AOR]], [[soft rock]], and [[boogie (genre)|boogie]] — that were associated with the country's nascent [[economic boom]] and [[leisure class]]. It was also identified with then-new technologies such as the [[Walkman]], cars with built-in [[cassette deck]]s and [[Car stereo|FM stereos]], and various [[electronic musical instruments]].\n\nThere is no unified consensus among scholars regarding the definition of city pop. In Japan, the tag simply referred to music that projected an \"[[urban area#Japan|urban]]\" feel and whose target demographic was urbanites. Many of the artists did not embrace the Japanese influences of their predecessors, and instead largely drew from American funk, soft rock and boogie. Some examples may also feature [[tropical music|tropical]] flourishes or elements taken from [[disco]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Okinawan music|Okinawan]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[Caribbean music]]. Singer-songwriter [[Tatsuro Yamashita]], who was among the genre's pioneers and most successful artists, is sometimes called the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#Y|\"king\" of city pop]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and early solo albums by YMO members [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Haruomi Hosono]] and [[Yukihiro Takahashi]], are also credited as heavily influencing the styles of mixing and arrangement that became central to the city pop genre.\n\nCity pop lost its mainstream appeal after the 1980s and was derided by younger Japanese generations. In the early 2010s, partly through the influence of music-sharing blogs and Japanese reissues, city pop gained an international online following as well as becoming a touchstone for the sample-based [[microgenre]]s known as [[vaporwave]] and [[future funk]].",
