  "description": "'''K-pop''' ({{Korean/auto|hangul=^케이팝|rr=yes}}; an abbreviation of \"Korean popular music\") is a form of [[popular music]] originating in South Korea. It emerged in the 1990s as a [[youth subculture]] of Korean musicians influenced by Western [[Electronic dance music|dance music]], [[hip-hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. Today, K-pop commonly refers to the musical output of [[teen idol]] acts, chiefly [[girl group]]s and [[boy band]]s, who emphasize [[Visual communication|visual appeal]] and [[Performing arts|performance]]. As a [[Pop music|pop]] genre, K-pop is characterized by its [[Melody|melodic]] quality and cultural hybridity.\n\nK-pop can trace its origins to \"rap dance\", a fusion of hip-hop, [[techno]] and rock popularized by the group [[Seo Taiji and Boys]], whose experimentation helped to modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene in the early 1990s. Their popularity with teenagers led the music industry to focus on this demographic. [[Lee Soo-man]] of [[SM Entertainment]], who developed the [[Korean idol]] system in the late 1990s, created [[H.O.T.]] and [[S.E.S. (group)|S.E.S.]], the \"first generation\" of K-pop. By the early 2000s, [[TVXQ]] and [[BoA]] had achieved success in Japan and gained traction for the genre overseas.\n\nIn the 2010s, the [[Korean Wave]] and [[social media]] drove the international popularity of K-pop. In 2019, South Korea ranked sixth among music markets, led by artists [[BTS]] and [[Blackpink]]. The next year, it grew a record 44.8%, making it the year's fastest-growing major market.\n\nDespite heavy influence from [[American popular music|American pop music]], some have argued that K-pop is distinct in mood and energy. The \"Koreanness\" of K-pop has been debated in recent years, with an increasing share of Western songwriters, non-Korean artists, songs in English and marketing for a global audience. Some authors have called K-pop a new kind of \"transnational culture\" with \"global dissemination\".\n\nK-pop is known for its tight managerial control. It has been criticized for its [[commercialism]] and treatment of artists. The industry is dominated by four companies: [[SM Entertainment|SM]], [[YG Entertainment|YG]], [[JYP Entertainment|JYP]] and [[Hybe Corporation|Hybe]]. In the 2020s, the genre has seen greater artist autonomy and companies producing music overseas; groups like [[JO1]] and [[Katseye]] have resulted from this [[globalization]].{{TOC limit|3}}",
