It was a strong trend and present in parties until the late-2000s. The Changa culture was mainstream in Venezuela along with other genres such as [[reggaeton]], [[salsa music|salsa]], and [[emo]]. Its dancers and supporters are known as ''tuki''(s). The dance that accompanies it is a style of ''ghetto'' dance.\n\nThey had a particular style of clothing that mostly consisted of tight red pants, [[sleeveless shirt]]s, caps that almost covered their eyes, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] shoes in the style of the [[Air Jordan]], and the use of [[hydrogen peroxide]] to dye their beards and tips of their hair.{{Clarify|date=March 2021}} An urban culture that in its great majority was related to the poor classes and especially to the trickery and a kind of thug.\n\nThe creators of this style and the greatest [[Disc jockey|DJs]] were DJ Baba and DJ Irvin, other DJs that could be mentioned were Pacheko, Pocz. Of the most remembered dancers we can mention Elber El Maestro among others.\n\nPortuguese DJs [[Buraka Som Sistema]] liked the raptor house and played many songs of this style and also compose. American DJ [[Scoop DeVille]] also expressed how he liked this movement saying that \"he has developed a true passion for this\".\n\nThe most famous meeting place in Caracas where the tuki music was danced and there were good DJs of the genre was ''Adrena''.\n\nAlso, many people at that time linked the tuki word offensively and that most of the Tukis were really Venezuelan-style thugs.",
