  "description": "'''G-funk''', short for '''gangsta funk''', (or '''funk rap''') is a sub-genre of [[gangsta rap]] that emerged from the [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] scene in the early 1990s. The genre is heavily influenced by the [[synthesizer]]-heavy 1970s [[funk]] sound of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] (aka P-Funk), often incorporated through samples or re-recordings. It is represented by commercially successful albums such as [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[The Chronic]]'' (1992), [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Doggystyle]]'' (1993), and [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]]'s ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' (1996).",
