  "description": "'''Dark cabaret''' is a [[music genre]] that draws on the aesthetics of [[burlesque]], [[vaudeville]] and [[Weimar culture|Weimar-era]] cabaret, generally played by groups with origins in [[rock music]].\n\nThe genre traces its roots to 1930s [[Weimar Republic]] experimental cabaret of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]], and their influence upon 1960s [[rock music|rock]] bands including [[the Doors]]. In the 1970s, the dark cabaret genre began to emerge with  [[Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel]]'s ''[[The Human Menagerie]]'' (1973) and [[Nico]]'s ''[[The End...]]'' (1974). During the 1980s, the genre was adopted by groups with origins in [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]] and [[gothic rock]], including [[Marc Almond]], [[the Virgin Prunes]], [[Nina Hagen]] and [[Sex Gang Children]]. These disparate forms of the genre were largely codified during the 1990s, through the works of [[the Tiger Lillies]], as well as [[Rozz Williams]] and [[Gitane Demone]]'s ''[[Dream Home Heartache]]'' (1995). During this decade, the [[neo-burlesque]] movement began, which allowed acts in the 2000s such as [[the Dresden Dolls]], [[the World/Inferno Friendship Society]], [[Jill Tracy]] and [[Katzenjammer Kabarett]] to gain mainstream attention. Amidst this period, the genre's influence from embraced by some prominent groups in the [[indie rock]] and [[emo pop]] genres.",
