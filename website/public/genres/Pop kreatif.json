  "description": "'''Pop kreatif''' ({{langx|en|creative pop}}) is an Indonesian offshoot and subgenre of [[Indo pop]] that emerged in the late 20th century as a fusion of [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian music]] and contemporary global influences such as [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[disco]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[soft rock]]. Rooted in [[urban culture]], the genre is often characterized by its smooth melodies, upbeat rhythms, and [[nostalgic]] themes. Initially, the genre had been associated and reflective to the rapid modernization and [[Economy of Indonesia|economic growth of Indonesia]] during the 1980s and early 1990s. By the late 2010's, pop kreatif gained popularity among Indonesian youth and has seen a resurgence within the Indonesian music scene.",
