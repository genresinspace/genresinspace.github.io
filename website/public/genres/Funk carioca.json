  "description": "'''Funk carioca''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈfɐ̃k(i) kɐɾiˈɔkɐ, - kaɾ-}}), also known as '''baile funk''' and '''Brazilian funk''', or even simply '''funk''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-influenced [[music genre]] from Rio de Janeiro, taking influences from musical styles such as [[Miami bass]] and [[Freestyle music|freestyle]].\n\nIn [[Brazil]], \"baile funk\" refers not to the music, but to the actual [[Dance party|parties]] or [[discotheque]]s in which the music is played ({{IPA|pt|ˈbajli}}, from ''baile'', meaning \"[[Ball (dance event)|ball]]\"). Although originated in Rio, \"funk [[carioca]]\" has become increasingly popular among working classes in other parts of Brazil. In the whole country, funk carioca is most often simply known as \"funk\", although it is very musically different from the American genre of [[funk music]]. In fact, it still shows its urban [[Afrobeat]] influences.",
