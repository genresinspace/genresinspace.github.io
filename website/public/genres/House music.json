  "description": "'''House music''', or simply '''House''', is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] characterized by a repetitive [[Four on the floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat and a typical [[tempo]] of 115â€“130 beats per minute. It was created by [[DJ]]s and music producers from [[Chicago]]'s underground [[Clubbing (subculture)|club culture]] and evolved slowly in the early/mid 1980s as DJs began altering [[disco]] songs to give them a more mechanical beat. By early 1988, house became mainstream and supplanted the typical 80s music beat.\n\nHouse was created and pioneered by DJs and producers in Chicago such as [[Frankie Knuckles]], [[Ron Hardy]], [[Jesse Saunders]], [[Chip E.]], [[Joe Smooth]], [[Steve \"Silk\" Hurley]], [[Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk]], [[Marshall Jefferson]], [[Phuture]], and others. House music initially expanded to [[New York City]], then internationally to cities such as [[London]], and ultimately became a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHouse has a large influence on [[pop music]], especially [[dance music]]. It was incorporated into works by major international artists including [[Whitney Houston]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Madonna]], [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Lady Gaga]], and produced many mainstream hits such as \"[[Pump Up the Jam]]\" by [[Technotronic]], \"[[French Kiss (Lil Louis song)|French Kiss]]\" by [[Lil Louis]], \"[[Show Me Love (Robin S. song)|Show Me Love]]\" by [[Robin S.]], and \"[[Push the Feeling On]]\" by the [[Nightcrawlers (band)|Nightcrawlers]]. Many house DJs also did and continue to do [[remix]]es for pop artists. House music has remained popular on radio and in clubs while retaining a foothold on the underground scenes across the globe.",
