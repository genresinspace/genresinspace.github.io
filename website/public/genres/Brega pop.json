  "description": "'''Calypso, Brega Calypso''' or just '''Brega-pop''', is a Brazilian musical genre that emerged in the Brazilian city of [[Belém]] (state of [[Pará]]), by mixing elements of Pará's regional genres such as ''[[lambada]], [[carimbó]]'', ''[[guitarrada]]'', ''siriá'', with international music from Caribbean countries, such as calypso, ska, reggae. It developed in the 1990s at concerts and dances in nightclubs on the outskirts of town and through street vendors promoting the production of small local/independent musicians.\n\nIt was created by musicians from the state of Pará in the city of Belém, who decided to combine the traditional regional brega with other rhythms from Caribbean music such as [[Calypso music|calypso]], from which point the name of this fusion also became calypso.",
