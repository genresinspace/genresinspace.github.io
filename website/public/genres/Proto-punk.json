  "description": "'''Proto-punk''' (or '''protopunk''') is a retrospective label for [[rock music]] from the 1960s to mid-1970s that anticipated the musical and thematic qualities of the [[punk rock]] genre and [[Punk subculture|movement]]. The musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other and came from a variety of backgrounds, scenes, countries and styles. \n\nThe tendency towards aggressive, raw, simplistic rock songs is a trend rooted in the earliest forms of [[rock and roll]] and early subgenres like [[rockabilly]], [[Frat rock|frat]] and [[surf rock]]. The American [[garage rock]] movement of the mid-1960s has been referred to as a key influence in the development of punk rock. By the late 1960s, [[Detroit]] bands [[the Stooges]] and [[MC5]] had taken the influence of garage groups to form a distinct prototypical punk sound. In the following years, this sound spread both domestically and internationally,  alongside the sound of 1970s developments such as [[glam rock]] and [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]], into several regional early underground punk scenes in [[New York punk|New York]], [[Cleveland punk|Ohio]], [[Punk rock in Australia|Australia]] and [[Punk rock#United Kingdom|England]].",
