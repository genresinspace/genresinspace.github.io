  "description": "'''Proto-punk''' (or '''protopunk''') is music that foreshadowed the [[punk rock]] genre, particularly [[rock music]] artists during the 1960s and early-to mid 1970s. A retrospective label, the musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other and came from a variety of backgrounds and styles; together, they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes. \n\nThe tendency towards aggressive, raw, simplistic rock songs is a trend rooted in the earliest forms of [[rock and roll]]. The American [[garage rock]] movement of the mid-1960s is a key influence in the development of punk rock. By the late 1960s, [[Detroit]] bands [[the Stooges]] and [[MC5]] had taken the influence of garage groups to form a distinct prototypical punk sound. In the following years, this sound spread both domestically and internationally,  alongside [[glam rock]] and [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]], into several regional early underground punk scenes in [[New York punk|New York]], [[Cleveland punk|Ohio]], [[Punk rock in Australia|Australia]] and [[Punk rock#United Kingdom|England]].",
