  "description": "'''Proto-punk''' (or '''protopunk''') is [[rock music]] from the 1960s to mid-1970s that foreshadowed the [[punk rock]] genre and movement. A retrospective label, the musicians involved were generally not originally associated with each other and came from a variety of backgrounds and styles; together, they anticipated many of punk's musical and thematic attributes. The tendency towards aggressive, simplistic rock songs is a trend critics such as [[Lester Bangs]] have traced to as far back as [[Ritchie Valens]]' 1958 version of the Mexican folk song \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\", which set in motion a wave of influential [[garage rock]] bands including [[the Kingsmen]], [[the Kinks]], [[the 13th Floor Elevators]] and [[the Sonics]]. By the late 1960s, [[Detroit]] bands [[the Stooges]] and [[MC5]] had used the influence of these groups to form a distinct prototypical punk sound. In the following years, this sound spread both domestically and internationally, leading to the formation of the [[New York Dolls]] and [[Electric Eels (band)|Electric Eels]] in the United States, [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] in England, and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in Australia.",
