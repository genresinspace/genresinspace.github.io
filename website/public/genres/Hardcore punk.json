  "description": "'''Hardcore punk''' (commonly abbreviated to '''hardcore''' or '''hXc''') is a [[punk rock]] subgenre and [[subculture]] that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock.  Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in [[San Francisco]] and [[Punk rock in California|Southern California]] which arose as a reaction against the still predominant [[History of the hippie movement|hippie]] cultural climate of the time. It was also inspired by [[Washington, D.C., hardcore#History|Washington, D.C.]], and [[Punk rock#New York City|New York]] punk rock and early [[proto-punk]]. Hardcore punk generally eschews [[commercialism]], the established [[music industry]] and \"anything similar to the characteristics of [[Rock music|mainstream rock]]\" and often addresses social and political topics with \"confrontational, politically charged lyrics\".\n\nHardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston hardcore|Boston]], and [[New York hardcore|New York]], as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the [[straight edge]] movement and its associated sub-movements, [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]] and [[youth crew]]. Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the [[independent record label]]s in the 1980s and with the [[Do it yourself|DIY ethics]] in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including [[grunge]] and [[thrash metal]].\n\nAlthough the music genre started in English-speaking Western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in [[Italian hardcore|Italy]], [[Japanese hardcore|Japan]] and [[Punk in Brazil|Brazil]].",
