  "description": "'''Hardbass''' or '''hard bass''' ({{lang-rus|хардбас(с)|khardbas(s){{efn|Sometimes, an additional [[Es (Cyrillic)|''с'']] (s) is not written.}}|xɐrdˈbas}}) is a subgenre of [[pumping house]] that originated in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia during the late 1990s, drawing inspiration from [[bouncy techno]], [[hardstyle]], as well as local [[Russian culture|Russian]] influences. Hardbass is characterized by its fast [[tempo]] (usually 150–175 BPM), donks, distinctive [[bassline]]s (commonly known as \"[[UK hard house#Hard bounce|hard bounce]]\"), distorted sounds, heavy kicks and occasional [[chant]]s or [[rapping]]. In several European countries, so-called \"hardbass scenes\" have sprung up, which are events related to the genre that involve multiple people dancing in public while masked, sometimes with [[moshing]] involved.",
