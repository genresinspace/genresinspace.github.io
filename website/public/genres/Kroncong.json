It is characterized by its lilting rhythm, distinctive sound from interlocking {{lang|jv|Cak}}–{{lang|jv|Cuk}}. A Kroncong orchestra (especially in Java), traditionally consists of a blend of local and European instruments like violins, European flutes, cellos and bass (usually in [[Pizzicato]]-style), pair of Kroncong ({{lang|jv|Cak}}–{{lang|jv|Cuk}}) and a vocalist (usually, but not limited to a female vocalist, traditionally taken from [[Pasindhèn]] – a Javanese vocalist in Javanese orchestra). \n\nAlthough the term Kroncong is a native [[Javanese language|Javanese]] term in origin, the Kroncong as a musical genre and instrument is an adaptation of a European (particularly the Portuguese and Dutch) musical tradition, brought by the European colonizers to the Java and Eastern Indonesian port cities in the 16th century.\n\n''[[Bengawan Solo (song)|Bengawan Solo]]'' ({{lit|[[Solo River|the great river of Solo]]}}) is one of the well-known Kroncong songs written by [[Gesang Martohartono]], a [[Central Java]]-origin legendary and influential Kroncong musician. Besides Gesang Martohartono, a Javanese female singer [[Waldjinah]] and a Batavian male musician [[Ismail Marzuki]] were amongst the top influential Native Indonesian figures in Kroncong revival in early 90s era. ''Krontjong Kemajoran'' ({{lit|the Kroncong of [[Kemayoran]]}}) was also the popular one amongst the [[Indo people|Javindo]] community, it is the Bataviaʼs folk songs revived and popularized by both Native Indonesians and Javindo-descent such as [[Wieteke van Dort]], a Surabaya-born singer. Through their revolutionary revival, the Kroncong gained its global popularity especially in [[Asia]] (especially in [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Javanese Malaysians|Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]), [[Europe]] (especially in the [[Netherlands]]) and the [[Americas]] (especially in [[Javanese Surinamese|Suriname]], [[United States of America|USA]], and [[Canada]]).\n\nSince 2015, Keroncong recognized as the local heritage of [[Java]] (especially the [[Greater Jakarta]] region), and in the following year, 2016, Keroncong is officially recognized and regarded by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology|Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Republic Indonesia]] as integral part of the [[National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia|National Intangible Cultural Heritage]] of Indonesia.",
