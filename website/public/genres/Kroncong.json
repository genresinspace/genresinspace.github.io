  "description": "'''Kroncong''' (pronounced \"kronchong\"; {{langx|id|Keroncong}}, {{langx|nl|Krontjong}}) is the name of a [[ukulele]]-like instrument and an Indonesian musical style that typically makes use of the kroncong (the sound ''{{not a typo|Crong-crong-crong}}'' comes from this instrument, so the music is called '''''kroncong'''''). A ''kroncong'' orchestra or ensemble traditionally consists of a flute, a violin, at least one, but usually a pair of ''kroncongs'', a cello in [[Pizzicato|Pizzicato style]], string bass in pizzicato style, and a vocalist.\n''Kroncong'' originated as an adaptation of a Portuguese musical tradition, brought by sailors to Indonesian port cities in the 16th century. By the late 19th century, ''kroncong'' reached popular music status throughout the Indonesian archipelago.",
