  "description": "'''{{lang|jv|Keroncong}}''' or '''{{lang|jv|Kroncong}}''' ({{ety|jv|{{Script|Java|ꦏꦼꦫꦺꦴꦤ꧀ꦕꦺꦴꦁ}}, {{lang|jv|keroncong}}|rumble}}, {{IPA|jv|kəˈrɔnt͡ʃɔŋ}}; {{langx|jvd|krontjong}}) refers to both a specific {{lang|jv|[[Cak (instrument)|Cak]]}}–{{lang|jv|[[Cuk (instrument)|Cuk]]}} (a ukulele-like) Javanese instrument, and a unique classical colonial [[Java]] and [[Eastern Indonesia]]n (particularly [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and eastern [[East Nusa Tenggara]]) musical genre that evolved and first developed in Java Island, especially at the Java port cities of [[Sunda Kelapa]] in [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surakarta]] in [[Central Java]], as well as [[Surabaya]] in [[East Java]], dates back to at least [[16th century]]. It is characterized by its lilting rhythm, distinctive sound from interlocking {{lang|jv|Cak}}–{{lang|jv|Cuk}}. A Kroncong orchestra (especially in Java), traditionally consists of a blend of local and European instruments like violins, European flutes, cellos and bass (usually in [[Pizzicato]]-style), pair of {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} and a vocalist (usually, but not limited to a female vocalist, traditionally taken from [[Pasindhèn]] – a Javanese vocalist in Javanese orchestra). {{lang|jv|[[Bengawan Solo (song)|Bengawan Solo]]}} ({{lit|[[Solo River|the great river of Solo]]}}) is one of the well-known {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} songs written by [[Gesang Martohartono]], a [[Central Java]]-origin legendary and influential {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} musician. Besides Gesang Martohartono, a Javanese female singer [[Waldjinah]] and a Batavian male musician [[Ismail Marzuki]] were amongst the top influential figures in {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} revival in early 90s era, through their revolutionary revival, the {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} gained its global popularity especially in [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].\n\nAlthough the term {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} is a native [[Javanese language|Javanese]] term in origin, the {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} as a musical genre and instrument believed by the locals (especially in communal area of [[Kampung Tugu]] on northwestern coastal region of Java), as an adaptation of a European (particularly the Portuguese and Dutch) musical tradition, brought by the European colonizers to the Java and Eastern Indonesian port cities in the 16th century. By the late 19th century, {{lang|jv|Kroncong}} reached popular music status throughout the [[Indonesian Archipelago]].\n\nSince [[2015]], {{lang|jv|Keroncong}} recognized as the local heritage of [[Java]] (especially the [[Greater Jakarta]] region), and in the following year, [[2016]], {{lang|jv|Keroncong}} officially recognized and regarded by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology|Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Republic Indonesia]] as integral part of the [[National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia|National Intangible Cultural Heritage]] of Indonesia.",
