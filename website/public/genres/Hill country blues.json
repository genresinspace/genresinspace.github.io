  "description": "'''Hill country blues''' (also known as '''North Mississippi hill country blues''' or '''North Mississippi blues''') is a regional style of [[country blues]]. It is characterized by a strong emphasis on rhythm and percussion, steady guitar riffs, few chord changes, unconventional song structures, and heavy emphasis on the \"groove\", which has been characterized as the \"hypnotic boogie\".\n\nThe hill country is a region of northern [[Mississippi]] bordering [[Tennessee]]. It lies in the counties of [[Marshall County, Mississippi|Marshall]], [[Panola County, Mississippi|Panola]], [[Tate County, Mississippi|Tate]], [[Tippah County, Mississippi|Tippah]], and [[Lafayette County, Mississippi|Lafayette]] and straddles the ecoregions of the North Hilly Plain (Red Clay Hills or North Central Hills), the Loess Plains, and Bluff Hills. The hills have poor agricultural soil and wide forested areas, which led to the development of a lumber industry but only small farms. [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] and [[Oxford, Mississippi]], are often cited as centers of hill country music. The style is regarded as distinct from the [[Delta blues|blues]] of the [[Mississippi Delta]], which lies west of the hill country. An annual picnic is held to celebrate the region and its music.",
