The term {{lang|ga|sean-nós}}, which simply means '[in the] old way', is a vague term that can also refer to [[Sean nós (disambiguation)|various other traditional activities]], musical and non-musical.\n\nThe musician and academic [[Tomás Ó Canainn]] said:{{rp|49}}\n\n<blockquote>\n...{{nbsp}}no aspect of Irish music can be fully understood without a deep appreciation of {{lang|ga|italics=no|sean-nós}} singing. It is the key which opens every lock.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe origins of {{lang|ga|sean-nós}} singing are unknown, but it is probably at least seven centuries old.",
