  "description": "\"'''Istrian scale'''\" refers both to a \"unique\" [[scale (music)|musical scale]] and to the folk music genres from [[Istria]] and [[Kvarner]] which use that scale. It is named for the Istrian peninsula. Istrian folk music is based on a distinctive six-tone musical scale (the so-called Istrian scale), and the peninsula's two-part, slightly nasal singing. The two-part singing and playing in the Istrian scale, a traditional singing practice characteristic of the Istrian region and the north Adriatic coastal area and islands, was inscribed in UNESCO's ''List of Intangible Cultural Heritage'' in 2009.\n\nGenres include ''kanat'' and ''tarankanje''; techniques include [[nasalization|nasal tone]], [[variation (music)|variation]] and [[musical improvisation|improvisation]], and [[resolution (music)|resolution]] to the [[unison]] or [[octave]]; and instruments include [[double reed]]s such as ''[[sopila|sopele]]'', [[shawm]]s, [[bagpipes]], and other instruments such as [[flute]]s and ''[[tamburica|tambura]]'' lutes. It was first named by [[Ivan MatetiÄ‡ Ronjgov]] early in the twentieth century, assisting his study and notation of [[Croatian music]].",
