In 2006, the group Bonde da Stronda saw nationwide success and a wave of media attention, inspiring the formation of several other groups.\n\nThough the genre was born in Rio de Janeiro, the scene quickly grew across the nation. Notably, D'Boss, a group from [[Brasília|Brasilia]], was the first non-Rio group to perform at a Stronda event in Rio. Several other groups, such as Divissão dos Playssons and BS Love, have emerged from other Brazilian states and are gaining popularity.\n\nStronda emerged from an attempt to blend [[Hip hop music|American hip-hop]] styles with issues relating to Brazil. Many Stronda artists have spoken out against their perception that non-Brazilians are \"prejudiced\" against their genre, as it largely pertains to slum culture and Brazilian lifestyles.",
