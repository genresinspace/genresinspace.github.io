  "description": "'''Instrumental rock''' is [[rock music]] that emphasizes instrumental performance and features very little or no [[singing]]. Examples of [[instrumental music]] in rock can be found in practically every subgenre of the style. Instrumental rock was most popular from the mid-1950s to mid-1960s, with artists such as [[Bill Doggett|Bill Doggett Combo]], [[The Fireballs]], [[The Shadows]],  [[The Ventures]], [[Johnny and the Hurricanes]] and [[The Spotnicks]]. [[Surf music]] had many instrumental songs. Many instrumental hits had roots from the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] genre. [[The Allman Brothers Band]] feature several instrumentals. [[Jeff Beck]] also recorded two instrumental albums in the 1970s. [[Progressive rock]] and [[art rock]] performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s did many [[virtuosic]] instrumental performances.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the instrumental rock genre was dominated by several guitar soloists, including [[Joe Satriani]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] and [[Steve Vai]]. The 2000s gave way to a new style of instrumental performer. For example, [[John 5 (guitarist)|John Lowery (a.k.a. John 5)]], released a series of solo instrumental albums. The 2000s also saw the rise of instrumental music by bands that have been labeled [[post-rock]].",
