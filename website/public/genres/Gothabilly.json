  "description": "'''Gothabilly''' (sometimes '''hellbilly''') is music genre influenced by [[rockabilly]] and the [[goth subculture]]. The name is a [[portmanteau]] word that combines ''gothic'' and ''rockabilly'', first used by [[the Cramps]] in the late 1970s to describe their somber blend of rockabilly and [[punk rock]]. Since then, the term has come to describe a fashion style influenced by [[gothic fashion]], as seen in its use of black [[silk]]s, [[satin]]s, [[lace]] and [[velvet]], [[corset]]s, [[top hat]]s, antique [[jewellery]], [[PVC]], and [[leather]].",
