  "description": "'''Happy hardcore''', also known as '''4-beat''', is a [[subgenre]] of hardcore dance music. It emerged both from the UK [[breakbeat hardcore]] [[rave scene]], and Belgian, German and Dutch [[hardcore techno]] scenes in the early 1990s. \n\nAlthough having some similarities, happy hardcore differs from [[gabber]] in that happy hardcore tends to have [[breakbeats]] running alongside the 4/4 kick drum.{{sfn|Reynolds|2013|p=263|loc=\"The difference between happy hardcore and happy gabba is slight: basically, the English tracks have sped-up breakbeats running alongside the stomping four-to-the-floor kick-drum, and at 170 b.p.m., they're slightly slower than happy gabba.\"}}",
