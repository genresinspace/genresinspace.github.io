  "description": "'''Happy hardcore''', also known as '''4-beat''' or '''happycore''', is a [[subgenre]] of [[hardcore (EDM)|hardcore dance music]] or \"[[hard dance]]\". It emerged both from the UK [[breakbeat hardcore]] [[rave scene]], and Belgian, German and Dutch [[hardcore techno]] scenes in the early 1990s. What makes happy hardcore stand apart from [[gabber]] is that happy hardcore tends to have breakbeats running alongside the 4/4 kick drum.{{sfn|Reynolds|2013|loc=chpt. 11: \"The difference between happy hardcore and happy gabba is slight: basically, the English tracks have sped-up breakbeats running alongside the stomping four-to-the-floor kick-drum, and at 170 b.p.m., they're slightly slower than happy gabba.\"}}"
