  "description": "'''Neon pop-punk''' (also known as simply '''neon pop''') is a form of pop-punk that emphasizes [[synthesizers]]. ''Alternative Press'' writer Tyler Sharp wrote that while this wasn't the first instance that \"a band decided to put fuzzy keys over their chord progressions, but it was a time when that formula was perfected.\" Kika Chatterjee of ''Alternative Press'' added that the late 2000s \"brought in glowing synths and poppy melodies that shifted the entire definition of [pop punk]\", giving it the \"neon\" moniker. Sharp cited [[Forever the Sickest Kids]]' debut album ''[[Underdog Alma Mater]]'' (2008) as \"a big moment\" for the genre.",
