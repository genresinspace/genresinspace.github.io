  "description": "'''Motswako''' is a subgenre of hip hop originating from South Africa additionally prominently popularized  in [[Botswana]]. Mafikeng, the genre's origin point, is located close to the [[border]] of Botswana, where [[Setswana]] (Tswana) is predominantly spoken similar to Mafikeng. Motswako blends rap lyrics in local languages like Setswana with English over a steady beat. It also incorporates languages such as [[Sesotho]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Afrikaans]] depending on the artist's background. Popularized by South African acts like [[Hip Hop Pantsula|HHP]] and Baphixile (comprising \"Prof\" and \"Blax Myth\") in the late nineties, it gained a significant following among local audiences. Many emerging artists in South Africa use motswako as a foundation for their music careers due to its accessible principles, emphasizing creative writing skills crucial for mastering the genre. South Africa and Botswana have a substantial pool of motswako artists, although female representation remains limited."
