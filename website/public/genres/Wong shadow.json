  "description": "'''Wong shadow''' ({{langx|th|วงชาโดว์}}; {{lit|Shadow band}}) was a short-lived [[Thailand|Thai]] [[popular music]] in the early 1960s. It was developed by native Thai musicians inspired by [[Western world|Western]] groups such as [[Cliff Richard & the Shadows]]. Its origins lie in [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States of America|American]] [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[surf rock]] artists like [[The Ventures]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Exotica]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country and western]] brought over by soldiers serving in [[Vietnam]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s when on [[R&R (military)|R&R]]. It also drew heavily on [[British invasion]] [[rock'n'roll]], [[garage rock]] and Hollywood film soundtracks as well.\n\nWong shadow is also a broad term for all popular music based on American R&B etc, though some British and American [[psychedelic rock]] acts drew on indigenous musical forms as well as rock'n'roll. The style's most representative artists were Johnny Guitar (จอนนี่ส์กีตาร์), P.M. Pocket Music (พี.เอ็ม.พ๊อกเกทมิวสิค) and Khabuan Mukda (ขบวน มุกดา). Wong shadow was also an influence on later genres, such as Thai pop and Thai rock.\n\nIt was originally known as \"Shadow Music\" following the release of the compilation ''Shadow Prayuk'' (ชาโดว์ ประยุกต์; Modernized The Shadow). The genre took its name from the band [[the Shadows]].",
