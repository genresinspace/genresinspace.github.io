  "description": "'''Vigilante rap''', also known as '''V-rap''' or '''rap das milícias''' is a musical style developed in Brazil and whose lyrics, as opposed to [[gangsta rap]], are about praising [[vigilantism]] and violent acts against criminals instead of criminal enterprise or [[gangster]] life.\n\nIn the ''[[Brazilian police militias|milícias]]''' turfs, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], V-rap is prevalent since any  endorsement of criminal enterprise is highly and violently discouraged and, thus, regular gangsta rap or ''[[proibidão]]'' (a kind of crude gangsta rap which emerged from the Brazilian slums) is not allowed to be played at parties or even in a citizen's house.",
