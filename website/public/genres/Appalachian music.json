  "description": "'''Appalachian music''' is the music of the region of [[Appalachia]] in the [[Eastern United States]]. Traditional Appalachian music is derived from various influences, including the [[ballad]]s, [[hymn]]s and [[fiddle]] music of the [[British Isles]] (particularly [[Scotland]]), and to a lesser extent the music of [[Continental Europe]].\n\nFirst recorded in the 1920s, Appalachian musicians were a key influence on the early development of [[old-time music]], [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[Rock music|rock n' roll]], and were an important part of the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s. Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and later the [[guitar]].\n\nEarly recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[G. B. Grayson]] & [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], [[Hedy West]] and [[Doc Watson]]. Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], The [[Stanley Brothers]] and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.",
