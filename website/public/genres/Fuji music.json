  "description": "'''Fújì''' is a genre of [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] popular music that emerged in [[Nigeria]] in the 1960s. It evolved from the improvisational [[Were music|wéré music]] also known as ajísari (meaning \"waking up for [[Suhur|sari]]\", performed to awaken [[Muslims]] before [[dawn]] during the [[Fasting in Islam|fasting]] season of [[Ramadan]]. Fuji music was named after the Japanese [[stratovolcano]]-mountain, [[Mount Fuji]] by [[Ayinde Barrister|Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]] (pioneer of wéré). It features energetic beats, diverse Yoruba rhythms, and [[Call and response|call-and-response]] vocals. Fuji's influence extends into contemporary music, with its hooks and rhythms frequently appearing in [[Nigerian hip hop]]. \n\nIn February 2024, professor and filmmaker [[Saheed Aderinto]] released the first episode of [[The Fuji Documentary]] titled \"Mr. Fuji: Barry Wonder\" which chronicles the story of Fuji music creator [[Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]].",
