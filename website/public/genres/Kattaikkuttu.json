  "description": "'''Kattaikkuttu''' [கட்டைக்கூத்து] is a rural, Tamil-language based, physical and vocal form of ensemble theatre form practised in the State of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]]. It is a form of Kūttu (also spelled as [[Koothu]]), a theatre art that originated in early [[Tamilakam]], though we are not sure what exactly the form and content of this theatre. The performers&nbsp;– by tradition only men&nbsp;– sing, act and dance and the musicians accompany them on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], the ''[[mridangam]]'' and ''dholak'', and the ''mukavinai''. The terms '''[[Terukkuttu|Terukkūttu]]''' [தெருக்கூத்து which translates as street theatre] and Kaṭṭaikkūttu are often used interchangeably. However, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while ''Terukkuttu'' referred to mobile performances by two actors participating in a procession for the village deity [[Mariamman]], ''Kattaikkuttu'' denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space acted by an ensemble of about fifteen actors and musicians.",
