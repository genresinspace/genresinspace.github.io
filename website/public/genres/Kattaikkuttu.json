  "description": "'''Kattaikkuttu''' is a rural theatre form practised in the State of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]]. It is a form of [[Koothu]], a folk art originated from the early [[Tamilakam]], The performers&nbsp;– by tradition only men&nbsp;– sing, act and dance and the musicians accompany them on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], the ''[[mridangam]]'' and the ''mukavinai''. The terms '''[[Terukkuttu]]''' and Kattaikkuttu are often used interchangeably. However, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while ''Terukkuttu'' referred to mobile performances by two actors participating in a procession for the village deity [[Mariamman]], ''Kattaikkuttu'' denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space acted by an ensemble of about fifteen actors and musicians.",
