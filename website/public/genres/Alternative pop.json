  "description": "'''Alternative pop''' (also known as '''alt-pop''') is [[pop music]] with broad commercial appeal that is made by figures outside the mainstream, or which is considered more original, challenging, or eclectic than traditional pop music. ''[[The Independent]]'' described alt-pop as \"a home-made, personalized imitation of the mainstream that speaks far closer to actual teenage experience\", and which is commonly characterized by a dark or downbeat emotional tone with lyrics about insecurity, regret, drugs, and anxiety.\n\nAccording to [[AllMusic]], the alternative scene's \"left-of-center pop\" failed to experience mainstream success during the 1980s, although the UK alternative pop band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] saw success in that decade. Canadian singer [[Avril Lavigne]]'s success in the early 2000s, including her hit single \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", helped set the stage for a subsequent generation of female alt-pop singers. In the late 2000s, American singer [[Santigold]] established herself as an \"alternative pop hero\" due to her apparent artistic conviction.\n\nIn the early 2010s, American singer [[Lana Del Rey]] developed a \"cult-like following\" with her \"cinematic, beat-heavy alt-pop\", which was characterized by an \"alluring sadness and melodrama\". New Zealand alt-pop singer [[Lorde]] achieved global success in 2013 and 2014, topping charts and winning awards. In 2022, American singer [[Billie Eilish]] was credited with marking the \"ascendence\" of alternative pop in the mainstream with her dark, downbeat pop.",
