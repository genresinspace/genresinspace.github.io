  "description": "'''Funk metal''' (also known as '''thrash-funk''' or '''punk-funk''') is a subgenre of [[funk rock]] and [[alternative metal]] that infuses [[heavy metal music]] (often [[thrash metal]]) with elements of [[funk]] and [[punk rock]]. Funk metal was part of the alternative metal movement, and has been described as a \"brief but extremely media-hyped stylistic fad\".\n\nThe funk metal scene formed in California during the mid-1980s with a group of bands who were initially playing a mix of funk, hard rock, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and punk; the genre quickly evolved to include elements of thrash metal.",
