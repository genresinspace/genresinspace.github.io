  "description": "'''Doom metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] that typically uses slower [[tempo]]s, [[Down-tuned guitar|low-tuned guitars]] and a much \"thicker\" or \"heavier\" sound than other heavy metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics are intended to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of [[Black Sabbath]], who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands such as [[Witchfinder General (band)|Witchfinder General]] and [[Pagan Altar]] from England, American bands [[Pentagram (band)|Pentagram]], [[Saint Vitus (band)|Saint Vitus]], [[the Obsessed]], [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]], and [[Cirith Ungol (band)|Cirith Ungol]], and Swedish band [[Candlemass (band)|Candlemass]] defined doom metal as a distinct genre. Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble and Candlemass have been referred to as \"the Big Four of Doom Metal\".",
