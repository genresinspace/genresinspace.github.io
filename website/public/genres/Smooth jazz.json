  "description": "'''Smooth jazz''' is commercially oriented [[crossover jazz]] music. Although often described as a \"genre\", it is a debatable and highly controversial subject in jazz music circles. As a radio format, however, [[smooth jazz radio]] became the successor to [[easy listening]] music on radio station programming from the mid-1970s through the early 1990s."
