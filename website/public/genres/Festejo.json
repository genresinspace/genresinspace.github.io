  "description": "'''''Festejo''''' (from Spanish 'fiesta') is a festive form of [[Afro-Peruvian music]]. The dance is a staple in the Black coastal populations and it celebrates the [[emancipation]] of slaves. Festejo is recognized for its high energy and the improvisation carried out by the dancers. Some believe that its origins trace back to competitive dance circles performed by individuals playing [[cajón]]s. Despite its African origins, people of all different backgrounds participate in the dance that many regard as one of the greatest representations of [[Peruvian culture]].\n\nIt is currently performed, in its most traditional form, in [[San Luis District, Cañete|San Luis de Cañete]] and [[El Carmen District, Chincha]]."
