  "description": "'''Pub rock''' is a style of Australian [[rock and roll]] that peaked in popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and that continues to influence [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] into the 21st century. It is named after the live music circuit in which most associated bands developed their sound: inner-city and suburban [[Australian pubs|pubs]]. These often noisy, hot, small and crowded venues favoured loud, [[riff]]-based heavy rock.\n\nAustralian pub rock emerged in the early 1970s, with bands such as [[Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs]], [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]], [[Lobby Loyde#Coloured Balls|Coloured Balls]] and [[Blackfeather]] pioneering the sound by incorporating [[hard rock]] and [[blues rock]], and occasionally elements of [[progressive rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. It developed separately from [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|British pub rock]], with the Australian sound being heavier, bluesier and more hard-edged. Later acts such as [[AC/DC]], [[Rose Tattoo]] and [[Cold Chisel]] expanded the sound further and achieved mainstream success.\n\nIn a few Australian cities, particularly [[Melbourne]], pub rock was associated with the [[Sharpies (Australian subculture)|Sharpies]] youth subculture.",
