  "description": "'''Space rock''' is a music genre characterized by loose and lengthy song structures centered on instrumental [[Texture (music)|textures]] that typically produce a [[hypnotic]], otherworldly sound. It may feature [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] and [[reverberation]]-laden guitars, minimal drumming, languid vocals, [[synthesizer]]s, and lyrical themes of [[outer space]] and [[science fiction]].\n\nThe genre emerged in late 1960s [[psychedelia]] and [[progressive rock]] bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[Hawkwind]], and [[Gong (band)|Gong]] who explored a \"cosmic\" sound. Similar sounds were pursued in the early 1970s' West German ''[[kosmische Musik]]'' (\"cosmic music\") scene. Later, the style was taken up in the mid-1980s by [[Spacemen 3]], whose \"[[Drone (music)|drone]]-heavy\" sound was avowedly inspired by and intended to accommodate drug use. By the 1990s, space rock developed into [[shoegaze]] and [[post-rock]] with bands such as [[the Verve]] and [[Flying Saucer Attack]].",
