  "description": "'''Urban Pasifika''' (also known as '''Urban Pacific''' and '''Urban Pacifika''') is a New Zealand [[subgenre]] of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], that developed primarily among [[Pasifika New Zealanders]] in [[South Auckland]]. Drawn from alternative hip hop and [[R&B]] influences, it was quickly blended with [[Pacific Island]] or [[M훮ori people|M훮ori]] instrumentation and traditional songwriting (such as [[ukulele]] samples) and [[singing]] and [[rapping]] in a variety of Polynesian languages, such as [[M훮ori language|M훮ori]], [[Samoans|Samoan]], [[Niuean language|Niuean]] and [[Tongan language|Tongan]]. The genre's genesis in the 1980s blossomed into a unique, globally enrapturing cultural scene in its homeland of [[Auckland]], especially in the next decade. Urban Pasifika is one of the most popular music genres to arise from New Zealand, and helped cement Auckland's reputation on the world stage as a major cultural centre, and the most ethnically [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] city in the world.\n\nIt originated within the [[Pasifika people in Auckland|Pasifika community in Auckland]], specifically its heavily Polynesian [[South Auckland|southern suburbs]]; the genre quickly gained traction, with a major scene in [[Wellington]]'s suburbs of [[Lyall Bay]], [[Newtown, New Zealand|Newtown]], [[Aro Valley]] and [[Te Aro]] within its [[Cuba Street, Wellington|Cuba Precinct]] (such as [[Fat Freddy's Drop]], [[King Kapisi]] and [[Upper Hutt Posse]]) and, to a lesser extent, [[Christchurch]] (with the globally successful rapper [[Scribe (rapper)|Scribe]]). Two of the best known examples of the genre are [[In the Neighbourhood|In The Neighbourhood]] by the duo [[Sisters Underground]], released in 1994, and [[OMC (band)|OMC]]'s [[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]] and [[On The Run (OMC song)|On The Run]], the former of which became a smash hit worldwide, topping the charts in multiple countries. The 1990s were the heyday for Urban Pasifika artists, and icons of the genre went on to become legends of [[New Zealand music]] and within the greater [[New Zealand diaspora]]."
