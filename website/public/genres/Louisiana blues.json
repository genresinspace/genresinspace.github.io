  "description": "'''Louisiana blues''' is a genre of [[blues]] music that developed in the period after World War II in the state of Louisiana. It is generally divided into two major subgenres, with the [[jazz]]-influenced [[New Orleans blues]] based on the musical traditions of that city and the slower tempo [[swamp blues]] incorporating influences from [[zydeco]] and [[Cajun music]] from around [[Baton Rouge]].\n\nMajor artists in the New Orleans tradition include [[Professor Longhair]] and [[Guitar Slim]] and for swamp blues [[Slim Harpo]] and [[Lightnin' Slim]]. Both genres peaked in popularity in the 1960s; interest declined in the later 1960s, but there have been occasional revivals since the 1970s.",
