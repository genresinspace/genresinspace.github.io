  "description": "In [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], and [[Suriname]], '''chutney soca''' music is a [[Crossover music|crossover style]] music style that blends [[Soca music|soca]] and [[Calypso music|calypso]] with [[chutney music]]—a genre rooted in [[Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Indo-Trinidadian]] culture.It incorporates [[English language|English]], [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]], and [[Hinglish]] lyrics, usingWestern instruments such as the guitar, piano, drum set, and Indian instruments such as the [[dholak]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[tabla]], and [[dhantal]].\n\nThe term chutney soca was first coined by [[Drupatee Ramgoonai]] of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in 1987 in her first album entitled ''Chutney Soca'', with a mix of [[Trinidadian English]] and [[Caribbean Hindustani#Trinidadian Hindustani|Trinidadian Hindustani]] versions of the songs. The current style of spelling of the term was not established then and she spelt it as \"Chatnee Soca\". The following year her hit \"Roll up de Tassa\" was instrumental in creating a commercial market for this type of music internationally. Drupatee has spoken about the blending of Afro and Indo melodies and rhythms in songs such as \"Chatnee Soca\" and \"Hotter than ah Chulha\". Chutney is a melody and soca is a beat. Drupatee used an ancient Indian melody called a ''lawnee'' with the soca beat in her rendition of \"O Tassawalley\" and has released a legacy of chutney soca music.",
