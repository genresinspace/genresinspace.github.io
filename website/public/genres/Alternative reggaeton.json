  "description": "'''Alternative reggaeton''' is a subgenre of [[reggaeton]] that emerged from the reggaeton movement as a reaction to its repetitive and monotone [[dembow]] rhythm, and the predominant stereotypical gangsta content that became predictable. The result was a complex sound derived from world sounds, mainly rooted in other [[Music of Latin America|Latin American music]] based genres such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[plena]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[Cumbia (Colombia)|cumbia]], [[tango music|tango]] and other foreign influenced music such as [[alternative rock]], [[Rock en Español|rock en español]] and [[Latin alternative]]. Mixed with thoughtful (and sometimes crude) lyricism guided by an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialism]] discourse, Latin American sociopolitical content, and racial pride, it gave listeners a smooth blend of danceable rhythms and intellectual dialogue.",
