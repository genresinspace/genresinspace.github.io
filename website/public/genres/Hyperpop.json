  "description": "'''Hyperpop''' is an [[electronic music|electronic]] music movement and loosely defined [[microgenre]] that originated in the early 2010s in the United Kingdom. It is characterised by an exaggerated or [[Maximalism|maximalist]] take on [[popular music]], and typically integrates [[pop music|pop]] and [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] sensibilities while drawing on elements commonly found in [[electronic music|electronic]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[dance music]]. The origins of hyperpop are primarily traced back to the output of English musician [[A. G. Cook]]'s record label and art collective [[PC Music]], with associated artists, [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], [[GFOTY]] and [[Charli XCX]], helping to pioneer a musical style that was later known as \"bubblegum bass\".\n\nIn 2019, the genre experienced a rise in popularity with the virality of the song \"[[Money Machine (song)|Money Machine]]\" by [[100 gecs]], and was further proliferated by [[Spotify]], whose employee  Lizzy Szabo launched the influential \"Hyperpop\" playlist, after spotting the term \"hyperpop\" on the platform's metadata, which had previously been added by data analyst [[Glenn McDonald (data engineer)|Glenn McDonald]] in 2018. Following this, the style gained wider popularity among [[Generation Z|Gen Z]] through [[social media]] platforms like [[TikTok]], particularly on [[Alt TikTok]], which boosted its exposure during the [[COVID-19 lockdowns]]. Additionally, several contemporaneous styles such as [[digicore]], [[glitchcore]], [[robloxcore]], [[dariacore]] and subgenres like [[hyperplugg]] and [[hyperfunk]] were also associated with the movement by the press. \n\nAfter hyperpop entered the mainstream in the early 2020s, the label was rejected by artists originally associated with the scene, which led to an overall decline in emerging musicians. The genre's influence was enduring in the development of subsequent internet [[Microgenre|microgenres]] that emerged or primarily developed in the early 2020s, such as [[sigilkore]], [[Jerk (music genre)|jerk]], [[Rage (music genre)|rage]], [[HexD|hexd]], and [[krushclub]], alongside the rise of [[Indie sleaze revival|indie sleaze]] and the [[Recession pop#2020s: Revival|recession pop]] revival.",
