  "description": "'''Hyperpop''' (sometimes called '''bubblegum bass''') is a loosely defined [[electronic music|electronic]] music movement and [[microgenre]] that predominantly originated during the early 2010s in the United Kingdom. It is characterised by an exaggerated or [[Maximalism|maximalist]] take on [[popular music]], and typically integrates [[pop music|pop]] and [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] sensibilities while drawing on elements commonly found in [[electronic music|electronic]], [[rock music|rock]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[dance music]].\n\nDeriving influence from a varied range of sources, the origins of the hyperpop scene are commonly traced to the output of English musician [[A. G. Cook]] and his record label [[PC Music]], as well as associated artists such as [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]] and [[Charli XCX]]. The approach received wider attention in August 2019 when [[Glenn McDonald (data engineer)|Glenn MacDonald]], an employee of [[Spotify]], used the term \"hyperpop\" for the name of a playlist featuring artists such as Cook and [[100 gecs]]. The style gained popularity among younger people through [[social media]] platforms like [[TikTok]], which boosted its exposure particularly during the [[COVID-19]] pandemic. After the term \"hyperpop\" began to be commonly used, many artists associated with it rejected the label, and by the early 2020s, it was considered by many to be a \"dead\" genre.",
