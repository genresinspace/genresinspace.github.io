  "description": "In music, '''montage''' (literally \"putting together\") or '''sound collage''' (\"gluing together\") is a technique where newly branded [[sound object]]s or [[Musical composition|compositions]], including songs, are created from [[collage]], also known as [[musique concr√®te]]. This is often done through the use of [[sampling (music)|sampling]], while some sound collages are produced by gluing together sectors of different [[vinyl records]]. Like its visual cousin, sound collage works may have a completely different effect than that of the component parts, even if the original parts are recognizable or from a single source. Audio collage was a feature of the [[audio art]] of [[John Cage]], [[Fluxus]], [[postmodern music|postmodern]] [[hip-hop]] and [[postconceptual]] [[digital art]].",
