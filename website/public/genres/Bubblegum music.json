  "description": "'''Bubblegum''' (also called '''bubblegum pop''') is [[pop music]] in a [[catchy]] and upbeat style that is marketed for children and adolescents.{{sfn|Cooper|Smay|2001|p=1}} The term also refers to a more specific [[rock music|rock]] and pop subgenre, originating in the United States in the late 1960s, that evolved from [[garage rock]], [[novelty song]]s, and the [[Brill Building (genre)|Brill Building sound]], and which was also defined by its target demographic of preteens and young teenagers. [[The Archies]]' 1969 hit \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\" was a representative example that led to '''cartoon rock''', a short-lived trend of [[Saturday-morning cartoon]] series that heavily featured [[pop rock]] songs in the bubblegum vein.\n\nProducer [[Jeffry Katz]] claimed credit for coining \"bubblegum\", saying that when they discussed their target audience, they decided it was \"teenagers, the young kids. And at the time we used to be chewing bubblegum, and my partner and I used to look at it and laugh and say, 'Ah, this is like bubblegum music'.\" The term was then popularized by their boss, [[Buddah Records]] label executive [[Neil Bogart]]. It became often used as a [[pejorative]] for pop music that is perceived to be disposable and contrived.{{sfn|Cooper|Smay|2001|p=1}} \n\nMost bubblegum acts were [[one-hit wonder]]s (notable exceptions included [[the Cowsills]], [[the Partridge Family]] and [[Tommy Roe]]) and the sound remained a significant commercial force until the early 1970s. Commentators often debate the scope of the genre and have variously argued for the exclusion or inclusion of [[dance-pop]], [[disco]], [[teen pop]], [[boy band]]s, and especially [[the Monkees]]. During the 1970s, the original bubblegum sound was a formative influence on [[punk rock]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and [[melodic metal]].",
