  "description": "'''Baroque pop''' (sometimes called '''baroque rock''') is a [[fusion genre]] that combines [[rock music]] with particular elements of [[classical music]].{{sfn|Jackson|2015|p=22}} It emerged in the mid-1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] compositional styles ([[contrapuntal]] melodies and [[functional harmony]] patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures.{{sfn|Hawkins|2015|p=193}} [[Harpsichord]]s figure prominently, while [[oboe]]s, [[French horn]]s, and [[string quartet]]s are also common.\n\nAlthough harpsichords had been deployed for a number of pop hits since the 1940s, some record producers in the 1960s increasingly placed the instrument in the foreground of their arrangements. Inspired partly by [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[In My Life]]\" (1965), various groups were incorporating baroque and classical instrumentation by early 1966. The term \"baroque rock\" was coined in promotional material for [[the Left Banke]], who used harpsichords and violins in their arrangements{{sfn|Unterberger|2014|p=416}} and whose 1966 song \"[[Walk Away Ren√©e]]\" exemplified the style.\n\nBaroque pop's mainstream popularity faded by the 1970s, partially because [[punk rock]], [[disco]] and [[hard rock]] took over; nonetheless, music was still produced within the genre's tradition. [[Philadelphia soul]] in the 1970s and [[chamber pop]] in the 1990s both reflected the spirit of baroque pop, while the latter incorporated much of the period's [[lo-fi music|low fidelity]] musical aesthetic.",
