  "description": "'''Sega''' ({{langx|fr|Séga}}) is one of the major [[music genre]]s of [[Mauritius]] and [[Réunion]]. It is a complete performance art, involving music, story-telling and traditional dance. Musically, the most modern forms common in Mauritius are its [[fusion genre]] [[Seggae]] and bhojpuri variations, whilst in Réunion we find the addition of [[maloya]], the latter being much closer to the older, typical music influences originating from Madagascar.  The variety of different sega forms is reflected in the multi-ethnic populous of the indigenous population of Mauritius.\n\nSega ([[Traditional Mauritian Sega]], [[Sega tambour Chagos]], [[Sega tambour of Rodrigues Island]]) have been included in [[UNESCO]]'s Intangible Cultural Heritage [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|lists]]. \n\nSega has its roots in the music of [[slave]]s as well as their descendants [[Mauritian Creole people]] and is usually sung in [[Mauritian Creole]] or [[Réunionese Creole]]. Sega is also popular on the islands of [[Agaléga]] and [[Rodrigues]] as well as [[Music of Seychelles|Seychelles]], though the music and dances differ and it is sung in these islands' respective [[creole language]]s. In the past, Sega music focused on traditional percussion instruments such as the [[ravanne]] and the [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], it was sung to protest against injustices in the Mauritian society, this particular version of Sega is known as [[Santé engagé]].",
