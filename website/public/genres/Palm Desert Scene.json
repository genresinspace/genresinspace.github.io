The Palm Desert Scene is also notable for fostering [[stoner rock]] pioneers [[Kyuss]]. The term \"stoner rock\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"desert rock\". However, not all Palm Desert scene bands are \"stoner rock\" and not all stoner rock bands sound exactly like those in Palm Desert. Palm Desert has been named by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine as \"one of the top seven rock n' roll cities in America\".",
