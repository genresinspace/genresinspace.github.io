Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional [[music of Japan]], and significantly in [[1960s in music|1960s]] [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]]. J-pop replaced ''[[kayōkyoku]]'' (\"Lyric Singing Music\"), a term for Japanese popular music from the 1920s to the 1980s in the Japanese music scene.\n\n[[Japanese rock]] bands such as [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]] fused [[the Beatles]] and [[Beach Boys]]-style rock with Japanese music in the 1960s{{ndash}}1970s. J-pop was further defined by [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[Crossover music|crossover]] [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] acts of the late 1970s, such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] and [[Southern All Stars]]. Popular styles of Japanese pop music include [[city pop]] and [[technopop]] during the 1970s{{ndash}}1980s, and [[Eurobeat#J-Euro|J-Euro]] (such as [[Namie Amuro]]) and [[Shibuya-kei]] during the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n[[Country music#Japan and Asia|Japanese country]] had popularity during the international popularity of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] in the 1960s{{ndash}}1970s as well, and it still has appeal due to the work of musicians like [[Charlie Nagatani]] and [[Tomi Fujiyama]], along with venues like [[Little Texas (Tokyo restaurant)|Little Texas]] in [[Tokyo]]. [[Japanese hip hop]] became mainstream with producer [[Nujabes]] during the 1990s–2000s, especially his work on ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', and [[Japanese pop culture]] is often seen with [[anime in hip hop]]. In addition, [[Latin music]], [[contemporary Christian music|CCM]], and [[gospel music]] have scenes within J-pop.",
