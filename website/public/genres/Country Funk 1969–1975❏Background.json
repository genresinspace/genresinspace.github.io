  "description": "The compilation represents selections from an obscure offshoot of [[Country music|country]] and [[funk]] music, deemed \"country funk\". Jessica Hundley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes country funk as \"an inherently defiant genre [â€¦] a style that encompasses the elation of [[Gospel music|gospel]] with the sexual thrust of the [[blues]], [[Country music|country]] [[hoedown]] [[harmony]] with inner city grit. It is both studio slick and barroom raw.\" Country funk has been described as geographically diverse: \"There was no central label or venue around which its practitioners congregated [...] Instead, these tracks are points on a map, representing nearly every corner of America and seemingly endless musical possibilities.\" Its peak period has been described as a \"curious, glorious moment in musical history when dirty, long-haired [[Country rock|country-rockers]] reclaimed [[Old-time music|hillbilly music]] from the slicksters who dominated mainstream country, refashioning the music in their own defiant image.\"\n\nThe compilation was produced by Zach Cowie, Matt Sullivan and [[Pat McCarthy (record producer)|Patrick McCarthy]]; the tracks were remastered by John Baldwin at John Baldwin Mastering.",
