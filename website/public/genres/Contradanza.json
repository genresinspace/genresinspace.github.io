  "description": "'''''Contradanza''''' (also called ''contradanza criolla'', ''danza'', ''danza criolla'', or '''''habanera''''') is the Spanish and Spanish-American version of the [[contradanse]], which was an internationally popular style of music and dance in the 18th century, derived from the [[Country dance|English country dance]] and adopted at the court of [[France]]. Contradanza was brought to America and there took on folkloric forms that still exist in [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Panama]] and [[Ecuador]].\n\nIn [[Cuba]] during the 19th century, it became an important genre, the first written music to be rhythmically based on an [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African rhythm pattern]] and the first Cuban dance to gain international popularity, the progenitor of [[danzón]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]] and [[cha-cha-chá (music)|cha-cha-cha]], with a characteristic \"habanera rhythm\" and sung lyrics.\n\nOutside Cuba, the Cuban contradanza became known as the ''habanera'' – the dance of [[Havana]] – and that name was adopted in Cuba itself subsequent to its international popularity in the later 19th century,{{sfn|Manuel|2009|p=97}} though it was never so called by the people who created it.",
