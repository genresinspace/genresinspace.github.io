  "description": "'''''Sevillanas''''' ({{IPA|es|seβiˈʝanas}}) are a type of folk music and dance of [[Sevilla]] and its region. They were derived from the [[Seguidilla]], an old [[Castilian people|Castilian]] folk music and dance genre. In the nineteenth century they were influenced by [[Flamenco]]. They have a relatively limited musical pattern but are rich in lyrics based on country life, virgins, country towns, neighborhoods, pilgrimage, and love themes. \n\n''Sevillanas'' can be heard mainly in fairs and festivals, including the famous [[Seville Fair]] (''Feria de abril de Sevilla''). Among local groups that perform it are the Los Romeros de la Puebla, Los Amigos de Gines, Las Corraleras de Lebrija, Cantores de Hispalis, and [[Los del Río]].\n\nSevillanas Rocieras are a religiously oriented genre of the Sevillana, with a particular emphasis on the [[Virgin of El Rocío]]. They are sung in numerous religious and cultural events in the South of the country.",
