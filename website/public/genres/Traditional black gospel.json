  "description": "'''Traditional black gospel''' is music that is written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding [[Black church|African American Christian]] life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. It is a form of [[Christian music]] and a subgenre of [[black gospel music]].\n\nLike other forms of music, the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and Christ.\n\nTraditional gospel music was popular in the mid-20th century.  It is the primary source for [[urban contemporary gospel]] and [[Christian hip hop]], which rose in popularity during the late 20th century and early 21st century.",
