  "description": "'''Schlager''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʃlaːɡɐ|lang}}, \"[[wikt:Schlager#German|hit(s)]]\") is a style of European [[popular music]] and [[radio format]] generally defined by catchy instrumental accompaniments to vocal pieces of pop music with simple, easygoing, and often sentimental lyrics.\n\n\n\nSchlager tracks are typically light [[Pop music|pop]] tunes or sweet, [[sentimental ballad]]s with simple, catchy melodies. Their [[lyrics]] typically center on love, relationships, and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Finnic, Nordic, Slavic, and Eastern European [[folk song]]s, with lyrics tending toward [[melancholia|melancholic]] and [[elegiac]] themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as [[easy listening]].\n\nThe style was frequently represented in the early years of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]  but has now been replaced by other pop music styles.",
