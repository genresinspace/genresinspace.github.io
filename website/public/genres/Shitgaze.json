  "description": "'''Shitgaze''' is a [[microgenre]] of [[rock music]] coined in 2005 by Kevin DeBroux of Pink Reason to describe the music of [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] rock band [[Psychedelic Horseshit]] from [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Lead singer Matt Whitehurst added the term to the band's [[Myspace]] page, where it became the tag for a \"Columbus-centric genre\". It was then adopted by the music press and used to describe bands with a similar aesthetic from other locations, such as Los Angeles.\n\nThe [[independent record label]] [[Siltbreeze]] became a central hub for the scene, along with the Columbus music venue Cafe Bourbon Street. Whitehurst cites the ''[[NME]]'s'' feature on shitgaze as what \"made it into a scene\". The style was characterized by its use of [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] production, guitar [[feedback]], [[Fuzz pedal|fuzz pedals]], [[Clipping (audio)|audio clipping]] and distorted sounds.  \n\nNotable acts include Psychedelic Horseshit, [[the Hospitals]], [[No Age]], [[Times New Viking]], [[Wavves]], [[Grave Babies]], [[Sic Alps]], [[Vivian Girls]], Sealings, [[Best Coast]], Meth Teeth, Pink Reason, the Bitters, [[Eat Skull]], [[the Intelligence]], Gang Wizard, [[Ty Segall]], and  P.H.F.",
