  "description": "'''DMV hip-hop''' is a blanket term for a regional genre of American [[hip-hop]] music that emerged in the [[Washington metropolitan area]], which comprises [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]].\n\nIn the early 1980s, Washington, D.C. native DJ100 was the first station to play [[hip-hop]], including the likes of [[Whistle 2]], [[Run-DMC]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], and the [[Beastie Boys]]. DJ100 aired 100.3fm from 1984 to 1990, and turned it into a jazz station before it became an oldies station.\n\nOther prominent D.C. stations include WPGC 95.5 and WKYS 93.9, both of which are. The city's traditional style has been described as not quite the same as [[East Coast hip-hop|New York City hip hop]] nor [[Southern hip-hop]]. Rather, it has been influenced by both regions to form its own unique style. The population of D.C. is not large enough to support as many distinct subgenres of rap as other metropolitan areas, and as a result, the sound and style of D.C. hip hop is very mixed.",
