In the 1990s, adult contemporary began to accommodate a hotter sound more inclusive of contemporary pop songs, and develop sub-categories devoted towards specific genres. \n\nIn [[radio broadcasting]], adult contemporary formats typically target the demographic of adults 25–44, as they are favored among advertisers. They are differentiated primarily by their playlists, with \"hot AC\" stations usually focusing on uptempo, mainstream music (including [[dance-pop]], [[contemporary R&B]], as well as [[Pop rock|pop]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[indie rock|indie]], and soft rock, while excluding more specialized types of [[hip-hop]], rock, [[teen pop]], and [[electronic dance music]] that have a stronger appeal to younger audiences), \"mainstream AC\" having a balance between current music and established hits from past decades, and \"soft AC\" having a more conservative sound. Other sub-categories of AC have also emerged, including [[rhythmic adult contemporary]] (which focuses particularly on [[dance music]]), and [[urban adult contemporary]] (which focuses on R&B and soul music).",
