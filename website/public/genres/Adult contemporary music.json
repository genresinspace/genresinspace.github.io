  "description": "'''Adult contemporary music''' ('''AC''') is a form of [[Radio broadcasting|radio]]-played [[popular music]], ranging from 1960s [[Vocal music|vocal]] and 1970s [[soft rock]] music to predominantly [[ballad]]-heavy music of the 1980s to the present day, with varying degrees of [[easy listening]], [[pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[quiet storm]] and [[Rock music|rock]] influence. Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of [[Pop rock|pop/rock]] music.\n\nAdult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on [[melody]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, abstains from [[profanity]] or complex lyricism, and is most commonly used as [[background music]] in heavily-frequented family areas such as [[supermarket]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[convention center]]s, or [[restaurant]]s. Like most of [[pop music]], its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[Verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]. The format is heavy on romantic [[sentimental ballad]]s which use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments such as [[piano]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and sometimes an [[orchestra]]l set. However, [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] are also usually used, with the electric guitar sound relatively faint and high-pitched. Additionally, post-80s adult contemporary music may feature [[synthesizer]]s (and other electronics, such as [[drum machines]]).\n\nAn AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes [[hip hop]], house/techno or [[heavy metal music]] and some forms of [[dance-pop]], [[teen pop]], and [[electronic dance music]] as these are less popular among adults, the target [[Demography|demographic]]. AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past, even some songs that never even charted the AC charts.  This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.\n\nOver the years, AC has spawned subgenres including \"hot AC\" (or \"modern AC\"), \"soft AC\" (also known as \"lite AC\"), \"[[Urban adult contemporary|urban AC]]\" (a softer type of [[urban contemporary music]]), \"[[Rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]\" (a softer type of [[rhythmic contemporary]]), and \"[[Christian adult contemporary|Christian AC]]\" (a softer type of [[contemporary Christian music]]). Some stations play only \"hot AC\", \"soft AC\", or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different [[Music genre|genre]]s.",
