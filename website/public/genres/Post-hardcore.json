  "description": "'''Post-hardcore''' is a [[punk rock]] [[music genre]] that maintains the aggression and intensity of [[hardcore punk]] but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression. Like the term \"[[post-punk]]\", the term \"post-hardcore\" has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. Initially taking inspiration from [[post-punk]] and [[noise rock]], post-hardcore began in the 1980s with bands like [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]]. The genre expanded in the 1980s and 1990s with releases by bands from cities which had established hardcore scenes, such as [[Fugazi]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] as well as groups such as [[Big Black]], [[Jawbox]], [[Quicksand (American band)|Quicksand]], and [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] who stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. [[Dischord Records]] became a major nexus of post-hardcore during this period.\n\nThe genre also began to incorporate more dense, complex, and atmospheric instrumentals with bands like [[Slint]] and [[Unwound]], and also experienced some crossover from indie rock with bands like [[The Dismemberment Plan]]. In the early- and mid-2000s, {{nowrap|post-hardcore}} achieved mainstream success with the popularity of bands like [[At the Drive-In]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Dance Gavin Dance]], [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Underoath]], [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[the Used]], [[Saosin]], [[Alexisonfire]], and [[Senses Fail]]. In the 2010s, bands like [[Sleeping with Sirens]] and [[Pierce the Veil]] achieved mainstream success under the post-hardcore label. Meanwhile, bands like [[Title Fight]] and [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]] experienced underground popularity playing music that bore a closer resemblance to the post-hardcore bands of the 1980s and 1990s.",
