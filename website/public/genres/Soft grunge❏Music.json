  "description": "Soft grunge music merges elements of [[emo]], [[shoegaze]], [[dream pop]], [[pop punk]], [[post-hardcore]] and [[alternative rock]]. The genre originated with bands from the [[hardcore punk]] scene who began making music inspired by 1990s emo and post-hardcore groups like [[Rival Schools (band)|Rival Schools]] and [[the Promise Ring]] as well as early 1990s alternative rock groups like the [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Soundgarden]] and [[Alice in Chains]]. In the early 2010s, the first wave of bands in the genre emerged, including [[Adventures (band)|Adventures]], [[Balance and Composure]], [[Basement (band)|Basement]], [[Citizen (band)|Citizen]], [[Pity Sex]], [[Superheaven]] and [[Turnover (band)|Turnover]]. The majority of these bands were signed to [[Run for Cover Records]], made use of fuzz pedals and filmed their music videos using [[8 mm film]]. [[Title Fight]] stood at the forefront of the genre with the success of their 2012 album ''[[Floral Green]]''. By the early 2020s, a second wave emerged including [[Fleshwater]] and [[Narrow Head]].\n\nOutside of the soft grunge genre, those who participate in online soft grunge communities often listened to Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX, [[the Neighbourhood]], [[the 1975]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Vampire Weekend]], Lana Del Rey and [[Marina Diamandis]]."
