  "description": "'''Dub''' is a musical style that grew out of [[reggae]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of [[remix]]es of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the [[rhythm section]] (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a [[riddim]]), the application of studio effects such as [[Delay (audio effect)|echo]] and [[reverb effect|reverb]], and the occasional [[dubbing (music)|dubbing]] of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.\n\n\nDub was pioneered by [[Audio engineer|recording engineers]] and producers such as [[King Tubby|Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock]], [[Scientist (musician)|Hopeton \"Scientist\" Brown]], [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]], [[Errol Thompson (audio engineer)|Errol Thompson]] and others beginning in the late 1960s. [[Augustus Pablo]], who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding [[melodica]] to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers [[Clive Chin]] and [[Herman Chin Loy]]. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the [[mixing console]] as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The [[Roland Space Echo]] was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects. \n\nDub has influenced many genres of music, including [[rock music|rock]], most significantly the subgenre of [[post-punk]] and other kinds of [[punk rock|punk]], [[pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-disco]], and later [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[electronic dance music]], and [[trip hop]]. Dub was a basis for the genres of [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], as well as a major influence on [[dubstep]], with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as [[Mad Professor]] continue to produce new material.",
