  "description": "'''Slacker rock''' (originally known as '''lo-fi''' or '''lo-fi indie''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[indie rock]] that emerged in the United States during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Characterized by a rejection of technical proficiency and production quality, in favor of stripped down [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi aesthetics]] and an apathetic singing style. The style was originally associated with [[Generation X]] [[Slacker|slacker culture]]. However, experienced a resurgence during the 2000s and 2010s amongst [[Millennials]] and [[Gen Z]].  \n\nNotable acts include  [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Built to Spill]], [[Sebadoh]], [[the Microphones]], [[Silver Jews]] and [[Guided By Voices]].",
