  "description": "'''Yodeling''' (also '''jodeling''' or '''yodelling''') is a form of singing which involves repeated and rapid changes of pitch between the low-pitch [[chest register]] (or \"chest voice\") and the high-pitch [[head register]] or [[falsetto]]. The English word ''yodel'' is derived from the [[German (language)|German]] word ''jodeln'', meaning \"to utter the syllable ''jo''\" (pronounced \"yo\"). This vocal technique is used in many cultures worldwide. Recent scientific research concerning yodeling and non-Western cultures suggests that music and speech may have evolved from a common [[prosodic]] precursor.\n\nAlpine yodeling was a longtime rural tradition in Europe, and became popular in the 1830s as entertainment in theaters and [[music hall]]s. In Europe, yodeling is still a major feature of folk music (''[[Volksmusik]]'') from [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Southern Germany]], the Eastern [[France|French]] regions of [[Alsace]] and [[Savoy]] and the [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] and can be heard in many contemporary folk songs, which are also featured on regular TV broadcasts.",
