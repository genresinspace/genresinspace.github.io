  "description": "'''Rockabilly''' is one of the earliest styles of [[rock and roll]] music. It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the [[Southern United States|South]]. As a genre, it blends the sound of [[Western music (North America)|Western musical styles]] such as [[country music|country]] with that of [[rhythm and blues]], leading to what is considered \"classic\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with rock and roll. The term \"rockabilly\" itself is a [[portmanteau]] of \"rock\" (from \"rock 'n' roll\") and \"[[hillbilly]]\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \"[[Hillbilly#Music|hillbilly music]]\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include [[western swing]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[jump blues]], and [[electric blues]].\n\nDefining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, [[boogie woogie]] piano riffs, vocal [[twang]]s, [[doo-wop]] acapella singing, and common use of the [[tape echo]]; and eventually came to incorporate different instruments and vocal harmonies. Initially popularized by artists such as [[Carl Perkins]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Johnny Burnette]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and others, the rockabilly style waned in the late 1950s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a revival. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within musical [[subculture]]s. Rockabilly has spawned a variety of sub-styles and has influenced the development of other genres such as [[punk rock]]."
