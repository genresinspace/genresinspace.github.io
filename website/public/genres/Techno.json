  "description": "'''Techno''' is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) which is generally [[Record producer|produced]] for use in a continuous [[DJ mix|DJ set]], with [[tempo]]s being in the range from 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm). The central [[Drum beat|rhythm]] is typically in [[Time signature#common time|common time]] ([[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}}]]) and often characterized by a repetitive [[Four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] [[Beat (music)|beat]]. Artists may use [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] such as [[drum machine]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], and [[synthesizer]]s, as well as [[digital audio workstation]]s. Drum machines from the 1980s such as [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s [[Roland TR-808]] and [[Roland TR-909]] are highly prized, and [[Software synthesizer|software emulations]] of such [[Retro style|retro]] instruments are popular in this style.\n\nMuch of the instrumentation in techno is used to emphasize the role of [[rhythm]] over other [[Elements of music|musical aspects]]. [[Singing|Vocals]] and [[Melody|melodies]] are uncommon. The use of [[sound synthesis]] in developing distinctive [[timbre]]s tends to feature more prominently. Typical [[Harmony|harmonic]] practices found in other forms of music are often ignored in favor of repetitive sequences of notes. More generally the creation of techno is heavily dependent on [[Music technology|music production technology]].\n\nUse of the term \"techno\" to refer to a type of [[electronic music]] originated in [[Germany]] in the early 1980s. In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation ''[[Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit]]'', the term came to be associated with a form of EDM produced in Detroit. [[Detroit techno]] resulted from the melding of [[synth-pop]] by artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] with [[African American music|African American styles]] such as [[house music|house]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[funk]]. Added to this is the influence of [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] and [[science-fiction]] themes relevant to life in contemporary American society, with [[Alvin Toffler]]'s book ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' a notable point of reference. The music produced in the mid-to-late 1980s by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]] (collectively known as [[The Belleville Three]]), along with [[Eddie Fowlkes]], [[Blake Baxter]], [[James Pennington]] and others is viewed as the ''first wave'' of techno from Detroit.\n\nAfter the success of house music in [[Europe]], techno grew in popularity in the [[United Kingdom]], Germany, [[Belgium]] and The [[Netherlands]]. Regional variants quickly evolved and by the early 1990s techno subgenres such as [[Acid techno|acid]], [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[Bleep techno|bleep]], [[Ambient techno|ambient]], and [[dub techno]] had developed. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term, so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as [[tech house]] and [[Trance music|trance]].",
