  "description": "'''Copy thachin''', or simply \"'''copy music'''\" is a genre of music in [[Myanmar]] that originates from the early 1980s. It merges the melody and instrumentals of international songs with [[Burmese language|Burmese]] vocals. Proponents of copy thachin argue that the style is separate from cover songs due to it having unique vocal arrangements and lyrics.\n\nA small portion of copy thachin songs are direct translations of their foreign counterparts, while the vast majority often have different meanings. Additionally, copy thachin is known to change locations from Western landmarks to local Burmese locations. [[Thukhamein Hlaing|Thukamein Hlaing]], [[Min Chit Thu]], [[Maung Thit Min]], and [[:my:ဝင်းမင်းထွေး|Win Min Htway]] were known to use clever wordplay and [[innuendo]]s to refer to deemed \"explicit\" or banned content such as [[Gang|gang violence]] or [[Premarital sex|premarital activities.]]\n\nAs of 2023, fewer than 140 vocalists recorded the more than 3,000 songs that make up the copy thachin repertoire. According to available data, just 22 bands accompanied half of all these songs. Notably, the band [[Iron Cross (Burmese band)|Iron Cross]] worked on a total of 660 songs."
