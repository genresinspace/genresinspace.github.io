  "description": "'''Lounge music''' is a type of [[easy listening]] music popular in the 1950s and 1960s. This music is meant to evoke in the listeners an emotion, or the feeling of being in a place with a tranquil theme such as a [[jungle]], an island paradise or [[outer space]]. It emerged from Dixieland jazz, Latin dance, the croon, experimental music, and the gimmick song. The range of lounge music encompasses [[beautiful music]]–influenced instrumentals, and modern [[electronica]] (with [[chill-out music|chillout]] and [[downtempo]] influences), while remaining thematically focused on its retro–[[space age]] cultural elements. The earliest type of lounge music appeared during the 1920s and 1930s, and was known as [[light music]].{{citation needed|reason=RS?|date=July 2025}}",
