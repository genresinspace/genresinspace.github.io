  "description": "'''Lounge music''' is a type of [[easy listening]] music popular in the 1950s and 1960s. It may be meant to evoke in the listeners the feeling of being in a place, usually with a tranquil theme, such as a [[jungle]], an island paradise or [[outer space]]. The range of lounge music encompasses [[beautiful music]]–influenced instrumentals, modern [[electronica]] (with [[chill-out music|chillout]] and [[downtempo]] influences), while remaining thematically focused on its retro–[[space age]] cultural elements. The earliest type of lounge music appeared during the 1920s and 1930s, and was known as [[light music]].",
