  "description": "'''Huayno''' ('''Waynu''' in [[Quechua language|Quechua]]) is a genre of popular [[Andean music]] and [[dance]]. It is especially common in [[Peru]], western [[Bolivia]], [[Argentine Northwest|northwest Argentina]] and northern [[Chile]], and is popular among the indigenous peoples, especially the [[Quechua people]]. The history of Huayno dates back to [[Viceroyalty of Peru|colonial Peru]] as a combination of traditional rural folk music and popular urban dance music. High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including [[quena]] (flute), [[harp]], [[Siku (panpipe)|siku]] (panpipe), [[accordion]], [[saxophone]], [[charango]], [[lute]], [[violin]], [[guitar]], and [[mandolin]]. Some elements of huayno originate in the music of the pre-[[Christopher Columbus|Columbian]] Andes, especially on the territory of the former [[Inca Empire]]. Huayno utilizes a distinctive rhythm in which the first beat is stressed and followed by two short beats."
