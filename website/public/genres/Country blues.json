  "description": "'''Country blues''' (also '''folk blues''', '''rural blues''', '''backwoods blues''', or '''downhome blues''') is one of the earliest forms of [[blues]] music.  The mainly solo vocal with acoustic [[fingerstyle guitar]] accompaniment developed in the rural [[Southern United States]] in the early 20th century.  It stands in contrast primarily to the [[Blues#Urban blues|urban blues]] style, especially in the pre-war era."
