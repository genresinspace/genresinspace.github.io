  "description": "'''Christian electronic dance music''', also known as '''CEDM''', '''Christian EDM''', '''Christian dance music''', '''CDM''', or '''Christian electronic music''', is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] and [[Christian music]]. Its musical styles closely mirror non-Christian EDM; however, the CEDM culture's lack of [[Drug use in music|drug use]] and emphasis on positive lyrics (often focused on Christianity-based principles) distinguish it from non-religious counterparts. EDM.com wrote, \"the [CEDM] culture can feel quite welcoming.\" Many live concerts and events have been held in Christian churches in addition to traditional venues such as Lumination, [[Creation Festival]], and [[LifeLight Music Festival]]. CEDM has also been incorporated into some [[Christian worship]] routines.",
