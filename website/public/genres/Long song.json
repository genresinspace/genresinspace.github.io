  "description": "The '''long song''' ({{langx|mn|{{MongolUnicode|ᠤᠷᠲᠠ ᠢᠢᠨ<br />ᠳᠠᠭᠤᠨ}}}}, ''Urtyn duu'') is one of the central elements of the traditional [[music of Mongolia]]. This genre is called \"Long song\" not only because the songs are long, but also because each [[syllable]] of text is extended for a long duration. A four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Certain long songs such as '''''Uvgin shuvuu khoyor''''', also known as '''''Jargaltain delger''''' (lit. 'Old man and the Bird') take up to three hours to sing at full length, with all thirty-two stanzas. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romantic, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a [[Morin khuur]] (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous [[flute]], called ''limbe''. [[Oirats|Oirat]] groups of the Western Mongols traditionally sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the [[Igil]]."
