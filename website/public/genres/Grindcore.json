  "description": "'''Grindcore''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] fusion genre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] that originated in the mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from abrasive-sounding musical styles, such as [[thrashcore]], [[crust punk]], [[hardcore punk]], [[extreme metal]], and [[industrial music|industrial]]. Grindcore is considered a more noise-filled style of hardcore punk while using hardcore's trademark characteristics such as heavily [[Guitar distortion|distorted]], [[Guitar tunings#Dropped tunings|down-tuned guitars]], grinding [[overdriven bass]], high-speed [[tempo]], [[blast beat]]s, and vocals which consist of [[Death growl|growls]], shouts and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups such as England's [[Napalm Death]] are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as [[Brutal Truth]] and [[Nasum]]. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and [[black humor]].\n\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\", which is far shorter than average for punk or metal; several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. Napalm Death holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for shortest song ever recorded with the 1.316-second \"[[You Suffer]]\" (1987). Many bands, such as [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]], record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of [[Bar (music)|bars]] in length.\n\nA variety of subgenres and [[microgenre]]s have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore; including [[goregrind]], focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and [[pathology]]), and [[pornogrind]], fixated on [[pornographic]] lyrical themes. Another offshoot is cybergrind which incorporates [[electronic music]] elements such as [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore punk and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.",
