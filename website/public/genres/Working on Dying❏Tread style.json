  "description": "Working on Dying is often attributed with creating the trap sub-genre ''tread'', which was coined by frequent collaborator Bootychaaain.'''' The genre is characterized by futuristic synthesisers, slowed down samples, busier drum programming with distinctive 808 patterns, high tempo (usually set around 160 to 190), usually having off-beat hi-hats in addition to trap's [[Triplet (music)|triplets]] and a fast style of lethargic [[rapping]]. It's also usual for producers to take influences from [[cloud rap]] such as lushy synth pads and reverb-heavy atmospheric production.\n\nForza has been credited with tuning 808s into a unique style that would later develop into tread. According to [[WOBC-FM]], production by Forza included \"his signature high tempo drums and unconventional 808 patterns that automatically makes you want to mosh\", describing him as \"a pioneer in the undergroundâ€™s Soundcloud scene\". One of the first works recognized as proliferating tread rap was 5 Finger Posse's mixtape ''Trapped in the Trenches'', produced by Working on Dying.\n\nAs tread became more established, Working on Dying would then promote their music through weekly releases called \"Tread Tuesdays\", a play on [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Fridays]]. Various rappers would be involved with the popularity of tread rap including [[Lucki]], [[Lil Yachty]], [[Black Kray]], WiFiGawd, 5 Finger Posse, Chxpo and others. The collective's persistent promotion through live performances, internet streams and consistent releases would pay off and bring them into the mainstream rap scene.",
