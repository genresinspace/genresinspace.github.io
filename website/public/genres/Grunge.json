  "description": "'''Grunge''' (originally known as the '''Seattle Sound''') is an [[alternative rock]] [[Music genre|genre]] and [[subculture]] that emerged during the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], particularly in [[Seattle]] and [[Music of Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], and other nearby cities. Grunge fuses elements of [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and features the [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] sound used in both genres, as well as [[bass guitar]], [[drums]], and vocals. Grunge also incorporates influences from [[indie rock]] bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], and [[Dinosaur Jr]]. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as [[social alienation]], [[Doubt|self-doubt]], [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[betrayal]], [[Social isolation|social]] and [[emotional isolation]], [[addiction]], [[psychological trauma]], and a desire for [[Liberty|freedom]].\n\nThe early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label [[Sub Pop]] and the region's [[underground music]] scene, with local bands such as [[Green River (band)|Green River]], the [[Melvins]], and [[Mudhoney]] playing key roles in the genre's development. Sub Pop marketed the style shrewdly, encouraging media outlets to describe the Seattle sound as \"grunge\"; the style became known as a hybrid of [[Punk (subculture)|punk]] and [[Metal (music)|metal]]. By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with similar sounding bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals. Grunge broke through into the mainstream in the early-to-mid-1990s, led by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' in 1991, and followed by other crossover successes including [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', [[Soundgarden]]'s ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'', and [[Alice in Chains]]' ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]''. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock, eventually making grunge the most popular form of [[hard rock]] music during the 1990s.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the {{nowrap|mid-to-late 1990s}}, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]], labeled by ''Time'' as \"the [[John Lennon]] of the swinging Northwest\", struggled with an addiction to heroin before [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|his suicide]] in 1994. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced [[modern rock]] music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into [[pop culture]] and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to [[Authenticity (philosophy)|be true to oneself]]. Grunge was also an influence on later genres, such as [[post-grunge]].",
