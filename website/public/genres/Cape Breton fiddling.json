  "description": "'''Cape Breton fiddling''' is a regional [[violin]] style which falls within the [[Celtic music]] idiom. The more predominant style in [[Cape Breton Island]]'s fiddle music was brought to North America by [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[immigrant]]s during the [[Highland Clearances]]. These Scottish immigrants were primarily from [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]]-speaking regions in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the [[Outer Hebrides]].  Although fiddling has changed since this time in Scotland, it is widely held{{Who|date=February 2010}} that the tradition of [[Scottish fiddling|Scottish fiddle music]] has been better preserved in Cape Breton. While there is a similar tradition from the Irish-style fiddling, that style is overlooked as a result of the Scottish presence in the area.\n\nIn the span of the 1920s to the 70s, Cape Breton's fiddling style faced decline. \n\nDance styles associated with the music are Cape Breton [[step dancing]], Cape Breton [[square dancing]] ([[Iona, Nova Scotia|Iona]] style and [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]] style), and [[highland dancing]].\n\nIn 2005, as a tribute to the area's [[traditional music]], the construction of a tourism center and the world's largest fiddle and bow was completed on the waterfront in [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]].",
