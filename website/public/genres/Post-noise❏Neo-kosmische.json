The term was also used by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' to label Brooklyn band Titan. In 2012, neo-kosmische would be used as a term by British magazine ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]''. That same year, Canadian magazine ''[[Exclaim!]]'' referred to [[Daniel Lopatin]] on the collaborative album ''[[Instrumental Tourist]]'' as \"neo-kosmische noodling\". \n\nBy December, ''[[The Quietus]]'' published a review of Bee Mask's ''When We Were Eating Unripe Pears'' by Rory Gibb, where he associated the term \"neo-kosmische\" with post-noise, stating \"Of all the neo-kosmische/post-noise explorers whose balmy currents have lapped at our shores over the past few years, Chris Madak is among the few who seem hellbent on mapping out genuinely new territory.\" In 2025, ''Pitchfork'' stated that Lopatin \"was at the vanguard of the American noise scene in the hazy years when it retreated from [[Audio feedback|feedback]]-soaked harshness into an unkanny [[kosmische]]\".",
