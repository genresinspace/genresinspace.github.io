  "description": "The '''''coladeira''''' ({{small|Local Portuguese pronunciation:}} {{IPA|pt|kulɐˈdejɾɐ|}}; {{langx|kea|koladera}}, {{IPA|kea|kolɐˈdeɾɐ|}}) is a [[music genre]] from [[Cape Verde]].\n\nIt is characterized by a variable [[tempo]], a 2-beat [[Bar (music)|bar]], and (in its most traditional form) a harmonic structure based in a [[cycle of fifths]]. The lyrics structure is organized in [[Musical strophe|strophes]] that alternate with a [[refrain]]. The tone is generally joyful and themes often include social criticism. Instrumentation typically includes a [[guitar]], a ''[[cavaquinho]]'', and percussion, among others.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, the genre originated in the 1930s when the composer [[Anton’ Tchitch’]] intentionally sped up the tempo of a ''[[Morna (music)|morna]].'' In the 1960s, it began to incorporate electric instruments.\n\n''Coladeira'' also refers to a ballroom dance done in pairs accompanied by the music."
