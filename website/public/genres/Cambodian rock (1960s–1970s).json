  "description": "'''Cambodian rock of the 1960s and 1970s''' was a thriving and prolific music scene based in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]], in which musicians created a unique sound by combining [[Music of Cambodia|traditional Cambodian music forms]] with rock and pop influences from records imported into the country from Latin America, Europe, and the United States. [[American Forces Network|U.S. armed forces radio]] that had been broadcast to troops stationed nearby during the [[Vietnam War]] was also a primary influence. This music scene was abruptly crushed by the [[Khmer Rouge]] communists in 1975, and many of its musicians disappeared or were executed during the ensuing [[Cambodian genocide]]. Due to its unique sounds and the tragic fate of many of its performers, the Cambodian rock scene has attracted the interest of music historians and record collectors, and the genre gained new popularity upon the international release of numerous compilation albums starting in the late 1990s.",
