  "description": "'''Post-Industrial''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[industrial music]] that originally emerged in the early 1980s, as a catch-all for several industrial music inspired styles, subgenres and fusions that followed the disbanding of Throbbing Gristle. While the original industrial sound was rooted in [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] and [[experimental music]], post-industrial offered more accessible, commercial and diverse offshoots, with the incorporation of traditional pop songwriting, and influences from a variety of genres, which later led to the mainstreaming of several popular acts during the 1990s. Artists incorporated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[disco]], [[reggae]], [[ambient music]], [[folk music]], [[post-punk]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]], and [[new age music]].\n\nChicago record label [[Wax Trax! Records]] was prominent in the widespread attention industrial music later received. The label was started by Jim Nash and Dannie Flesher, and became a central hub for the emerging [[industrial rock]] genre during the late 1980s to early 1990s. Wax Trax! released albums by artists such as [[Front 242]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Sister Machine Gun]]. Another prominent label was Canada's [[Nettwerk Music Group|Nettwerk]] which signed [[Skinny Puppy]]. Subsequent post-industrial styles included [[dark ambient]], [[power noise]], [[Japanoise]], industrial rock, [[neofolk]], [[electro-industrial]], [[EBM music|EBM]], [[industrial hip hop]], [[industrial metal]], [[industrial pop]], [[martial industrial]], [[futurepop]] and later [[Witch house (music genre)|witch house]].",
