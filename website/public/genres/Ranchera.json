  "description": "'''Ranchera''' ({{IPA|es|ranˈtʃeɾa|pron}}) or '''canción ranchera''' is a genre of traditional [[music of Mexico]]. It dates to before the years of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Rancheras today are played in the vast majority of [[regional Mexican]] music styles. Drawing on rural traditional folk music, the ranchera developed as a symbol of a new national consciousness in reaction to the aristocratic tastes of the period.{{citation needed|date= October 2022}}",
