  "description": "'''Gypsy punk''' is a hybrid [[Music genre|musical genre]] that combines traditional [[Romani music|Romani]] and [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] folk music with [[punk rock]], and is considered a subgenre of the wider label of [[folk punk]].  One of the first rock groups to incorporate elements of punk and Roma music was [[Boiled in Lead]], which was founded in 1983 and is still active today. A broader audience became aware of the genre after the band [[Gogol Bordello]] released the album ''[[Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike]]'', with front man [[Eugene Hütz]] describing their performance as a \"Gypsy Punk Cabaret\".\n\nGypsy punk bands usually combine rock beats and instrumentation with more traditional Roma instrumentation such as [[Drum kit|drums]], [[tambourine]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[trumpet]] and [[saxophone]].",
