  "description": "'''Boomba music''', also referred to as '''kapuka''' (due to the beat pattern; not to be confused with '''kapuka rap'''), is a form of [[hip pop|hip pop music]] popular in [[Kenya]]. It incorporates [[hip hop]], [[reggae]] and African traditional musical styles. The lyrics are in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Sheng slang|Sheng]] or local dialects. It is associated with the [[Ogopa Deejays]] and is believed to have originated in the late 1990s with artists such as [[Redsan]], [[Bebe Cool]] and [[Chameleone]]. It went on to dominate East African airwaves (especially Kenya and [[Uganda]]) after the release of the Ogopa Deejays' first album in 2001, which included artists such as the late [[E-Sir]], [[David Mathenge|Nameless]], Mr. Lenny, [[Amani (musician)|Amani]], [[Mr. Googz]] and Vinnie Banton amongst others.\n\nThe over-saturation of playlists with this music style caused some to criticise it, including the artists [[K-South]] who had a hit titled \"Kapuka This, Kapuka That\". This{{clarify|date=November 2016}} also led to other styles such as [[genge]] music being formed by producer [[Clemo]] to diversify the market. Despite the critics the music continues to be very popular in Kenya although more so now in Uganda. Of late, \"genge\" has also come to refer more generally to boomba and \"kapuka\" music.",
