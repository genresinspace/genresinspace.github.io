  "description": "'''Reggae punk''' (also known as '''punk reggae''') is a genre of music originating in [[England]] in the late-1970s. It is characterized by a fusion of [[reggae]] music with [[punk rock]]. The genre originated amongst punk rock artists who mixed in reggae (and sometimes [[lovers rock]]) elements into their punk rock sound. The most notable band to do this was [[the Clash]], having done so on many records. They even covered reggae songs such as [[Toots and the Maytals]]' \"[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]\", released as the B-side to \"[[English Civil War (song)|English Civil War]]\", both from 1978's ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]''. [[Bob Marley]] also gave a nod to this genre by writing and recording \"Punky Reggae Party\" in 1977.\n\nAs the 1980s dawned, the genre would infuse itself into other Jamaican inspired genres, such as [[Two-tone (music genre)|two-tone]] and [[ska punk]].",
