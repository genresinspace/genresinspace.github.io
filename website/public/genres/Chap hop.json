  "description": "'''Chap hop''' is a fusion genre of music originating from England that mixes the [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] genre with elements from the [[The Chap|Chappist]] or [[steampunk]] subcultures and stereotypical English obsessions such as cricket, tea, and the weather.\n\nTwo leading exponents of the genre are [[Professor Elemental]] and [[Mr.B The Gentleman Rhymer]], who belong to the steampunk and Chappist factions of chap hop respectively. Other notable artists are Poplock Holmes & DJ WattsOn, and Sir Reginald Pikedevant, Esquire. \n\nIn March 2013, UK Education Secretary [[Michael Gove]] said he was a fan of the genre. Mr. B noted the irony of this, since his music often pokes at members of the establishment, commenting: \"As a non-[[Etonian]] and thus an outcast within the cabinet, this is perhaps a little snook cocked at his colleagues.\"",
