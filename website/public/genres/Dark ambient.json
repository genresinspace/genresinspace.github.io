  "description": "'''Dark ambient''' (referred to as '''ambient industrial''' especially in the 1980s) is a genre of [[post-industrial music]] that features an [[ominous]], dark droning and often gloomy, monumental or a [[Catacombs|catacomb]]-inspired atmosphere, partially with discordant overtones. It shows similarities with [[ambient music]], a genre that has been cited as a main influence by many dark ambient artists, both conceptually and compositionally. Although mostly electronically generated, dark ambient also includes the sampling of hand-played instruments and semi-acoustic recording procedures.\n\n{{anchor|History}}",
