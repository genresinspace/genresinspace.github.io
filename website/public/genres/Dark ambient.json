  "description": "'''Dark ambient''' (originally known as '''ambient industrial''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[post-industrial music]], that originally emerged in the mid-1980s. It draws primary influence from [[ambient music]] and is characterized by [[ominous]], dark [[Drone (sound)|drones]], discordant overtones and a gloomy, monumental or [[Catacombs|catacomb]]-inspired atmosphere. Although mostly an electronic genre, artists frequently sample traditional instruments and make use of semi-acoustic recording procedures. \n\n{{anchor|History}}",
