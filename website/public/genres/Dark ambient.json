It draws primary influence from [[ambient music]] and is characterized by [[ominous]], dark [[droning|drones]], discordant overtones and a gloomy, monumental or [[Catacombs|catacomb]]-inspired atmosphere. Although mostly an electronic genre, artists frequently sample traditional instruments and make use of semi-acoustic recording procedures. \n\n{{anchor|History}}",
