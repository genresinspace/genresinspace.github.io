  "description": "'''Outsider house''' (originally spawned as '''outsider dance''', also known as '''raw house''') is a subgenre of [[house music]], combining elements of [[deep house]], [[techno]], [[noise (music genre)|noise]], and [[Ambient music|ambient]], with artists embracing [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi techniques]] rather than the polished cleanliness of mainstream deep house and other [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] genres.\n\nThe term \"outsider dance\" was first coined in 2012 by the [[London]]-based DJ [[Ben UFO]] and emphasized by music journalist Scott Wilson, referring to different producers and record labels \"operating at the fringes of the fringes\" such as [[Laurel Halo]], [[Anthony Naples]]. However, [[Ben UFO]] himself called the term \"off-the-cuff formulation\", reacting negatively to the term taking hold and circulating, stating \"I'm not exactly happy that it's now being held up as a genre, because I think this outsider thing just doesn't do justice to the artists and their music. ... [outsider house artists] are my friends, we get along well and support each other\".",
