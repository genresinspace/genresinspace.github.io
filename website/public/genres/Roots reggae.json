  "description": "'''Roots reggae''' is a subgenre of [[reggae]] that deals with the everyday lives and aspirations of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] and those in the [[African Diaspora]], including the spiritual side of [[Rastafari]], black liberation,  [[revolution]] and the honouring of [[God]], called [[Jah]] by Rastafarians. It is identified with the life of the [[ghetto]] sufferer, and the rural poor. Lyrical themes include [[spirituality]] and religion, struggles by artists, [[poverty]], [[black pride]], social issues, resistance to [[fascism]], [[capitalism]], corrupt [[government]] and racial [[oppression]]. A spiritual [[repatriation]] to Africa is a common theme in roots reggae.",
