  "description": "'''Mexican pop''' is a [[Genre (music)|music genre]] produced in [[Mexico]], particularly intended for teenagers and young adults.\n\nMexico is the country that exports the most entertainment in [[Spanish language]]. Mexican pop was limited to Latin America until the mid-1990s, when an interest towards this type of music increased after [[Selena]]'s, [[Luis Miguel]]'s, [[Paulina Rubio]]'s, [[Thalía]]'s and [[Angélica María]]'s debuts before the mainstream USA audience.\n\nIn the southwestern United States, Spanish guitar rhythms and Mexican musical influences may have inspired some of the music of American musicians [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Danny Flores]] (of [[The Champs]]), [[Sam the Sham]], [[Roy Orbison]] and later, [[Herb Alpert]]. Initially, the public exhibited only moderate interest in them, because the media attention was focused on ''La Ola Inglesa'' ([[British Invasion]]). Mexican artis of the time were [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[María Luisa Landín]], [[Fernando Fernández (actor)|Fernando Fernández]], and [[Luis Pérez Meza]] in the 1940s. [[Agustin Lara]] is recognized as one of the most popular songwriters of his era together with [[Consuelo Velázquez]].\n\nIn 1954 [[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]], relocated to Mexico where he became a star of radio, television, motion pictures, records and nightclubs. During the 1960s and 1970s, most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted on Spanish-language versions of English-language [[rock-and-roll]] hits. Singers and musical groups like [[César Costa]], [[Angélica María]], [[Enrique Guzmán]], [[Alberto Vázquez (singer)|Alberto Vázquez]], [[Manolo Muñoz]], [[Johnny Laboriel]], [[Julissa]] or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Joan Baez]] and others. However, after the substantial success of [[Mexican-American]] guitarist [[Carlos Santana]] in the United States in the late 1960s, a large number of bands sprang up. Most of these bands sang in both Spanish and English, keeping foreign commercial exposure in mind.",
