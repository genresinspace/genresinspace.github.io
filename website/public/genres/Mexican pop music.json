  "description": "'''Mexican pop''' is a [[Genre (music)|music genre]] produced in [[Mexico]], particularly intended for teenagers and young adults. Mexico is the leading exporter of [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] entertainment. Until the mid-1990s, Mexican pop was largely limited to Latin America. That began to change as artists like [[Angélica María]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Selena]] gained international recognition, while artists like [[Thalía]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Belinda Peregrín|Belinda]], and [[Aleks Syntek]] recorded songs in English, introducing their music to mainstream U.S. audiences and helping Mexican pop reach an international stage.\n\n[[María Grever|Maria Grever]], active from the 1910s through the 1940s, brought romantic ballads and Spanish guitar rhythms to the United States that helped shape early southwestern music. [[Lydia Mendoza]], recording from the late 1920s into the 1980s, shared rancheras and corridos with wide audiences through her heartfelt vocals and guitar. Following her, [[Rosita Fernández]] performed in San Antonio from the late 1930s through the 1960s, popularizing Mexican folk and border songs. Later, [[Danny Flores]] fused Mexican and Latin rhythms with rock and roll in the 1950s, [[Ritchie Valens]] blended Mexican folk with early rock in the late 1950s, and [[Sam the Sham]] added Tex-Mex influences to 1960s pop hits. Together, these artists trace a line of musical influence from early border traditions to mid-century southwestern rock and Tejano music.\n\nMexican artis of the time were [[Lucha Reyes (Mexican singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[María Luisa Landín]], [[Fernando Fernández (actor)|Fernando Fernández]], and [[Luis Pérez Meza]] in the 1940s. [[Agustin Lara]] is recognized as one of the most popular songwriters of his era together with [[Consuelo Velázquez]]. In 1954 [[Andy Russell (singer)|Andy Russell]], relocated to Mexico where he became a star of radio, television, motion pictures, records and nightclubs. During the 1960s and 1970s, most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted on Spanish-language versions of English-language [[rock-and-roll]] hits. Singers and musical groups like [[César Costa]], [[Angélica María]], [[Enrique Guzmán]], [[Alberto Vázquez (singer)|Alberto Vázquez]], [[Manolo Muñoz]], [[Johnny Laboriel]], [[Julissa]] or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Beatles]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Paul Anka]], [[Petula Clark]], and [[Joan Baez]] and others. Initially, the public exhibited only moderate interest in them, because the media attention was focused on ''La Ola Inglesa'' ([[British Invasion]]).However, after the substantial success of [[Mexican-American]] guitarist [[Carlos Santana]] in the United States in the late 1960s, a large number of bands sprang up. Most of these bands sang in both Spanish and English, keeping foreign commercial exposure in mind.",
