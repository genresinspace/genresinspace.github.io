The style was originally pioneered by artists such as [[Talk Talk]], [[Galaxie 500]], [[Low (band)|Low]], [[Codeine (band)|Codeine]], [[Red House Painters]], [[Spain (band)|Spain]], [[Duster (band)|Duster]], [[Ida (band)|Ida]] and [[Bedhead (band)|Bedhead]], while primarily drawing influences from [[dream pop]], [[folk rock|folk]] and [[alternative rock]], and being related to the development of [[post-rock]].\n\nWhile facing [[controversy]] terminologically throughout the late 20th century, slowcore has developed in conjunction with sadcore into the 21st century.",
