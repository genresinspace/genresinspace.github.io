  "description": "'''Afro-Cuban jazz''' is the earliest form of [[Latin jazz]]. It mixes [[Afro-Cuban]] [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]-based rhythms with [[jazz]] harmonies and techniques of improvisation. Afro-Cuban music has deep roots in African ritual and rhythm. The genre emerged in the early 1940s with the Cuban musicians [[Mario Bauzá]] and [[Machito|Frank Grillo \"Machito\"]] in the band Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. In 1947, the collaborations of [[bebop]] trumpeter [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and percussionist [[Chano Pozo]] brought Afro-Cuban rhythms and instruments, such as the [[tumbadora]] and the [[Bongo drum|bongo]], into the East Coast jazz scene. Early combinations of jazz with Cuban music, such as \"[[Manteca (song)|Manteca]]\" and \"Mangó Mangüé\", were commonly referred to as \"Cubop\" for Cuban bebop.\n\nDuring its first decades, the Afro-Cuban jazz movement was stronger in the United States than in Cuba.{{rp|59}} In the early 1970s, [[Kenny Dorham]] and his Orquesta Cubana de Música Moderna, and later [[Irakere]], brought Afro-Cuban jazz into the Cuban music scene, influencing styles such as [[songo music|songo]].",
