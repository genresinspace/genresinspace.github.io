  "description": "{{Nihongo|'''Anime song'''|アニメソング|anime songu|also shortened to {{nihongo|'''''anison'''''|アニソン}}}}  is a genre of music originating from [[Japanese pop music]]. Anime songs consist of theme, insert, and [[image song]]s for [[anime]], [[manga]], video game, and [[audio drama]] CD series, as well as any other song released primarily for the anime market, including music from Japanese [[Voice acting in Japan|voice actors]].\n\nThe anime song genre was first defined as a musical category in the 1970s. It later gained popularity from the public when mainstream artists begin releasing songs as [[tie-in]]s for anime series. By the 1990s, it became redefined as a separate genre when companies began creating [[record label]]s that would exclusively produce anime songs for their series and artists. The increase in voice actors beginning in the mid-2000s led to growing market interest in the genre. By the start of the 2020s anime music would achieve international popularity  with companies such as [[Spotify]], [[Crunchyroll]], [[Warner Music Japan]] and [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] investing in anime-related music.",
