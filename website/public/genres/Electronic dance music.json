  "description": "'''Electronic dance music''' ('''EDM'''),{{sfnp|Koskoff|2004|p=44}} also referred to as '''dance music''' or '''club music''', is a broad range of percussive [[electronic music]] genres originally made for [[nightclub]]s, [[rave]]s, and [[List of electronic dance music festivals|festivals]]. It is generally produced for [[gapless playback|playback]] by DJs who create seamless selections of tracks, called a [[DJ mix]], by [[segue]]ing from one recording to another.{{sfnp|Butler|2006|pp=12–13, 94}} EDM producers also perform their music live in a [[concert]] or festival setting in what is sometimes called a [[live PA]]. Since its inception EDM has expanded to include a wide range of subgenres.\n\nDuring the late 1980s to early 1990s, following the emergence of [[electronic music instruments]], [[Rave music|rave culture]], [[pirate radio]], [[party crews]], underground festivals, and an upsurge of interest in [[club culture]], EDM achieved mainstream popularity in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. However, rave culture was not as broadly popular in the United States; it was not typically seen outside of the regional scenes in [[New York City]], Florida, the Midwest, and California. Although the pioneer genres of [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[Chicago house]] and [[Detroit techno]] were influential both in Europe and the [[United States]], mainstream media outlets and the [[record industry]] in the United States remained openly hostile to it until the 1990s and beyond. There was also a perceived association between EDM and [[drug culture]], which led governments at state and city levels to enact laws and policies intended to halt the spread of rave culture.\n\nSubsequently, in the new millennium, the popularity of EDM increased globally, particularly in the United States and Australia. By the early 2010s, the term \"electronic dance music\" and the [[initialism]] \"EDM\" was being [[Push–pull strategy#Push–pull music marketing future|pushed]] by the American [[music industry]] and [[Music journalism|music press]] in an effort to [[rebranding|rebrand]] American [[rave]] culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the name remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[House music|house]], [[techno]], [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[Trance music|trance]], as well as their respective subgenres, which all predate the name.",
