The term ''phleng phuea chiwit'' (songs for life) came from \"art for life\" or \"literature for life\", that is, literature on life and society, while phleng phuea chiwit era flourishing in the 1970s also known as \"jewel of the literature of life\".\n\nIn the 1980s, phleng phuea chiwit became less focused on political themes in its lyrics and placed greater emphasis on reflecting societal issues, poverty, and the influences of rural lifestyles. The genre morphed into a more clearly defined style that combined the sound and aesthetic of Western-style folk rock with commercially accessible songwriting, as exemplified by bands like [[Carabao (band)|Carabao]], Hammer, and artists such as [[Phongthep Kradonchamnan]], and [[Pongsit Kamphee]]. [[Thanapol Intharit]] became one of the most successful acts in the phleng phuea chiwit and [[Thai rock]] scenes of the 1990s.",
