  "description": "'''Christian adult contemporary''', also known as '''Christian AC''', '''CAC''', or '''Christian Adult Contemporary Airplay''', is a form of [[Radio broadcasting|radio]]-played [[contemporary Christian music]], ranging from 1960s [[Jesus music]] and 1970s [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[soft rock]] music to predominately [[Worship music|worship]]-heavy music of the 1980s to the present day, with varying degrees of [[easy listening]], [[contemporary Christian music|CCM]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Christian R&B]], [[quiet storm]] and [[Christian rock]] influence. Primarily in the United States and Canada, Christian adult contemporary radio stations cater to a mostly adult audience and are similar to mainstream [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] stations in that they play hits often and for long periods of time. Christian adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style Jesus music that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[Pop rock|pop/rock]] music.\n\nLike mainstream adult contemporary, Christian adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on [[melody]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, abstains from complex lyricism, and is most commonly used as [[background music]] in heavily-frequented family areas such as [[supermarket]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[convention center]]s, or [[restaurant]]s that are heavily influenced on Christian faiths and beliefs. Like most of [[contemporary Christian music]] (and [[pop music]] in general), its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[Verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]. The format is heavy on [[Worship music|worship]] songs which use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments such as [[piano]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and sometimes an [[orchestra]]l set. However, [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] is also used, with the electric guitar sound relatively faint and high-pitched. Additionally post-80s adult contemporary Christian music may feature [[synthesizer]]s (and other electronics, such [[drum machines]]).\n\nA Christian AC station may play [[contemporary Christian music]], but it usually excludes [[Christian hip hop]] and some forms of [[Christian electronic dance music|Christian]] [[dance-pop]] and [[teen pop]], as these are less popular among adults, the target [[Demography|demographic]]. Christian AC radio, like mainstream AC radio, often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s.\n\nOver the years, Christian AC has spawned subgenres including \"Christian hot AC\" (or \"modern Christian AC\"), \"Christian soft AC\" (also known as \"contemporary inspirational\"), \"[[Urban adult contemporary|urban AC]] [[Urban contemporary gospel|gospel]]\" (a softer type of [[urban contemporary gospel]]), and \"[[Contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[Rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]\" (a softer type of [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[rhythmic contemporary]]). Some stations play only \"Christian hot AC\", \"Christian soft AC\", or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of Christian music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different [[Christian music|Christian]] [[Music genres|genres]].",
