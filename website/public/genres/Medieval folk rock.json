  "description": "'''Medieval folk rock''', '''medieval rock''' or '''medieval folk''' is a musical subgenre that emerged in the early 1970s in England and Germany which combined elements of [[early music]] with [[rock music]]. It grew out of the [[British folk rock]] and [[progressive folk]] movements of the late 1960s. Despite the name, the term was used indiscriminately to categorise performers who incorporated elements of [[medieval music|medieval]], [[renaissance music|renaissance]] and [[baroque music]] into their work and sometimes to describe groups who used few, or no, electric instruments. This subgenre reached its height towards the middle of the 1970s when it achieved some mainstream success in Britain, but within a few years most groups had either disbanded, or were absorbed into the wider movements of [[progressive folk]] and [[progressive rock]].  Nevertheless, the genre had a considerable impact within progressive rock where early music, and [[medievalism]] in general, was a major influence and through that in the development of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. More recently medieval folk rock has revived in popularity along with other forms of medieval inspired music such as [[Dark Wave]] orientated [[neo-Medieval music]] and [[medieval metal]].",
