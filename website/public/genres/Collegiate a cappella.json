  "description": "'''Collegiate a cappella''' (or '''college a cappella''') ensembles are college-affiliated [[singing]] groups, primarily in the United States, and, increasingly, the United Kingdom and Ireland, that perform entirely without [[musical instruments]]. The groups are typically composed of, operated by, and directed by students. In the context of collegiate a cappella, the term ''a cappella'' typically also refers to the [[music genre]] performed by [[pop music|pop-centric]] student singing groups. Consequently, an ensemble that sings unaccompanied classical music may not be considered an a cappella group, even though technically it is performing ''a cappella''.\n\nAccording to the nonfiction book ''Pitch Perfect'', ''[[a cappella]]'' music is one of the oldest forms of music in existence, \"the kind made without any accompaniment at all,\" and descended from the tradition of [[Gregorian chant]]. A cappella music as a form joined this early form with a later Puritan style, known as shape-note singing, which further extended into the American Gospel tradition. Further permutations leaked into the American pop landscape. Today, by some accounts, there exist as many as “twelve hundred collegiate a cappella groups in the United States alone.”",
