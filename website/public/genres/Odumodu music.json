It is mainly used to uplift spirits and entertain guests at events, while extolling the virtues of illustrious men and women, and telling stories that edify.\n\nIt is the traditional music played acoustically in live or recorded form at festive events, such as the [[Ekpe/Okonko]] (masquerade festival), [[Iwa akwa]] (manhood rite of passage), Ichi Echichi (coronation and titling ceremonies), Iza Aha (age-grade maturity ceremony), Ikeji/Iriji (new yam festival), Igbankwu Nwanyi (bridal wine-carrying dance at marriage ceremonies), Igboto Mma (retirement celebration for elderly men), Olili (burial celebration of life), etc.\n\nIt is sung by mainly men with syncopating rhythms of chants and harmonized choruses, incorporating traditional Igbo percussions, such as the ekwe/ekere, ikoro, [[udu]], ekpete/igba (congas), ogele (big gongs), oyo, etc. The blending of wise sayings, parables, mystifying hums, and the melodic drumming gives it a captivating feel that leaves the listener dancing in pace with its beats.\n\nOdumodu is usually sung in the call-response style, which features vocals from a lead singer who elicits the response and backing of a group of vocalists, who are often the instrumentalists. Some famous Odumodu artists include [[Mary Kanu]] of [[Arochukwu|Atani Arochukwu]], Prof [[Obewe]] and King [[Ogenwanne]] of [[Ohuhu]], Umuahia, Brother Ezeugo of Ogbodi, Umuahia, Ichie Nwamuruamu of Ibeku, Umuahia, and many more.\n\n{{Igbo topics}}",
