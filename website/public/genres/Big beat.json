  "description": "'''Big beat''' is an [[electronic music]] genre that usually uses heavy [[breakbeat]]s and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns –  common to [[acid house]]/[[techno]]. The term has been used by the British music industry to describe music by artists such as [[the Chemical Brothers]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[the Crystal Method]], [[Propellerheads]], and [[Groove Armada]].\n\nBig beat achieved mainstream success during the 1990s, and achieved its critical and commercial peak between 1995 and 1999, with releases such as the Chemical Brothers’ ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]'', and Fatboy Slim's ''[[You've Come a Long Way, Baby]]'', before quickly declining from 2001 onwards.",
