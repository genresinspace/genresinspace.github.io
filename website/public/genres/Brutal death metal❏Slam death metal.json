  "description": "'''Slam death metal''' (also referred to simply as '''slam''') is a subgenre of brutal death metal which focuses on slam riffs. The genre originated from the 1990s [[New York City|New York]] death metal scene, incorporating elements of [[New York hardcore (genre)|New York hardcore]] and [[hip hop music]]. In contrast to other death metal styles, it is not generally focused on guitar solos and blast beats; instead, it employs mid-tempo rhythms, breakdowns and palm-muted riffing, as well as hip hop-inspired vocal and drum beat rhythms. When blast beats are used, it is often traditional blasts and gravity blasts used only as accents. [[Syncopation]] between guitar and drums is also a focal point.\n\nIn addition to slower riffing, slam death metal is also said to be characterized by guttural vocals and a \"high pitched, ringy\" [[snare drum]] sound. The subgenre \"shares some of the bounce and groove from [[nu metal]],\" and tends to avoid the experimental elements common in early death metal.\n\nThe [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdown]] riff of Suffocation's \"Liege of Inveracity\" (1991) has been credited by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as the first slam riff in death metal.  The first wave of bands in the genre were New York bands like [[Internal Bleeding (band)|Internal Bleeding]], Pyrexia and Afterbirth, with notable groups from outside of this state from this time including [[Devourment]] and [[Cephalotripsy (band)|Cephalotripsy]].\n\nThe name \"slam\" in reference to death metal was coined by the members of Internal Bleeding. In a 2024 interview, Internal Bleeding guitarist Chris Pervelis explained that because the band's emphasis on groove was to encourage [[moshing]], they originally called their music \"mosh\" metal, \"barbaric mosh\" or \"death mosh\". However, drummer Bill Tolley associated the word \"mosh\" with the jovial tone of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. To avoid this association Tolley pushed for the word \"slam\" due to its early hardcore origins.\n\n\nThe popularity of [[deathcore]] and its shared interest in breakdowns led to a revived interest in slam beginning in the midâ€“2000s, seen through the popularity of groups including Infected Malignity and Abominable Putridity and the reformation of Devourment. This wave saw an increase in production quality in the genre, a contrast from the raw production of earlier bands. This wave was largely based online, particularly on social media sites, with the [[Facebook]] group Slam Worldwide playing a major role in promotion. This led to many groups forming outside of the genre's native United States, such as [[Extermination Dismemberment]] from Belarus, Coprocephalic from Taiwan, Acranius from Germany and a number of groups from the Philippines: Human Mastication, Nekroholocaust, Cranial Torture, Pus Vomit, Projectile Vomit and Impulsive Emesis. Furthermore, northern England, particularly [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]], developed a scene during this wave, with groups including [[Ingested (band)|Ingested]] and Exhumation, as well as UK Slam Festival. To the extent that ''Distorted Sound'' magazine called Manchester \"''Slam''chester\". In a 2009 article by ''[[MetalSucks]]'' stated \"slam is THE big thing in death metal right now, divisive as it is\".\n\nSlam was integral to the development of the genres [[beatdown hardcore]] and [[deathcore]]. Furthermore, elements of its sound, particular its distinctive riffing style, has been incorporated into merged with various genres including hardcore, black metal and general death metal.",
