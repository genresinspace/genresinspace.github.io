  "description": "'''Dangdut''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɑː|ŋ|'|d|uː|t}}) is a genre of [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[folk music]] that is partly derived and fused from [[Hindustani Classical Music|Hindustani]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]], and, to a lesser extent, Javanese, Malay, Minangkabau, Sundanese and local folk music. Dangdut is the most popular musical genre in Indonesia and very popular in other [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]n countries because of its melodious instrumentation and vocals. Dangdut features a [[tabla]] and [[gendang]] beat.\n\nSeveral popular dangdut singers include [[Rhoma Irama]], [[Mansyur S.]], [[Elvy Sukaesih]], [[Camelia Malik]] and now [[Iyeth Bustami]], [[Ayu Ting Ting]], [[Lesti Kejora]] and [[Via Vallen]] as Indonesian dangdut [[diva]]s. Their music includes strong Indian music influences as the basis of harmony, theme, and beat. A dangdut musical group typically consists of a lead singer, backed by four to eight musicians. Instruments usually include a [[tabla]], [[gendang]], [[flute]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]]s, [[sitar]], [[drum machine]]s, and [[synthesizer|synthesiser]]s. Modern dangdut incorporates influences from Middle Eastern pop music, Western rock, [[reggae]], [[disco music|disco]], [[contemporary R&B]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[house music|house]], and [[electronic dance music]].\n\nThe popularity of dangdut peaked in the 1970s and 1980s but emerged in the late 1960s. By 2012, it was still largely popular in Western Indonesia, but the genre was becoming less popular in the eastern parts, apart from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Meanwhile, more regional and faster-paced forms of dangdut (as opposed to slower, Bollywood-influenced dangdut) have risen in popularity.",
