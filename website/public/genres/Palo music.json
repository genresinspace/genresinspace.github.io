  "description": "'''Palo''', also known as atabales is a Dominican (Dominican Republic) sacred music that can be found through the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies - usually coinciding with saint's days - as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo Basin|Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies. Palos are related to Dominican [[folk Catholicism]], which includes a pantheon of deities/saints (here termed misterios) much like those found in the Afro-American syncretic religious traditions of Cuba, Brazil, Haiti, and elsewhere. Palos are usually associated with the black and mixed populations. They can be seen in different regions of Dominican Republic, but with variations.",
