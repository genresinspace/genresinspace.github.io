  "description": "In [[Hindustani classical music]], '''''vivadi''''' ({{langx|sa|[[wikt:विवादि|विवादि]]}} meaning \"[[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]\") refers to pitches that are not part of the ''[[arohana]]'' or ''[[avrohana]]'' of a given [[raga]]. In general, ''vivadi'' are not to be played during an improvisation on a given raga. So, for instance, if a raga had the structure [[Swara|S R G m P D N S']], S' N D P m G R S; in that case, r, g, M, d and n would all be ''vivadi''. Although ''vivadi'' pitches are generally to be avoided during the playing of a given raga, they are occasionally added by skilled performers in order to introduce some color to an interpretation.",
