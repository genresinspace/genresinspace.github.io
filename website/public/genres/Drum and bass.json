  "description": "'''Drum and bass''' ('''D&B'''), also known as '''drum 'n' bass''' ('''DnB''' or '''D'n'B'''), is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1990s. It is characterised by fast [[Break (music)#Breakbeat (element of music)|breakbeats]] (typically 165â€“185 [[Tempo|beats per minute]]) with heavy [[Bass (music)|bass]] and [[sub-bass]] lines, [[Sampling (music)|samples]], and [[synthesizer]]s. \n\nOriginating in the UK [[Jungle music|jungle]] scene in the early 1990s, drum and bass drew on elements of [[reggae]], [[dub]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[breakbeat hardcore]], [[techno]], and [[house music|house]]. By the mid-1990s, it had become one of the most distinctive and technically innovative styles within the broader electronic dance music movement. The style of drum and bass often incorporates an array of influences from other genres including [[ambient music|ambient]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[pop music|pop]]. The genre has since developed multiple subgenres and maintains both an underground and mainstream presence worldwide. \n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other UK dance styles. A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound that influenced [[Jungle music|jungle]]'s bass-heavy sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]]. Drum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (also known as liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]]. Drum and bass has influenced other genres such as [[big beat]], [[dubstep]], [[trip hop]] and has been influenced by [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[house music|house]], [[ambient music]], [[techno]], [[jazz]], [[Rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]].\n\nDrum and bass is dominated by a relatively small group of record labels. Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016. Since then, the genre has seen a significant growth in exposure. Whilst the origin of drum and bass music is in the UK, the genre has evolved considerably with many other prominent fanbases located all over the world.",
