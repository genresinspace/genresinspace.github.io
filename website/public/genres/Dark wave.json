  "description": "'''Dark wave''' (also known as '''darkwave''') is a music genre that emerged from the [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[post-punk]] movement of the late 1970s. Dark wave compositions are largely based on [[Key (music)|minor key]] tonality and introspective lyrics and have been perceived as being dark, romantic and bleak, with an undertone of sorrow. Common features include the use of [[chordophone]]s such as electric and acoustic guitar, violin and piano, as well as electronic instruments such as synthesizer, sampler and drum machine. Like new wave, dark wave is not a \"unified genre but rather an umbrella term\" that encompasses a variety of musical styles, including [[Cold wave (music)|cold wave]], [[ethereal wave]], [[gothic rock]], [[neoclassical dark wave]] and [[neofolk]].{{dubious|date=August 2025}}\n\nIn the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose followers were called \"wavers\" or \"dark wavers\". In some countries, most notably Germany, the movement also included fans of gothic rock (so-called \"trad-goths\").",
