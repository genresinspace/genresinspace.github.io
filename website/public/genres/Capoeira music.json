  "description": "'''Capoeira music''' is the traditional musical accompaniment used in [[Afro-Brazilians|Afro-Brazilian]] art [[capoeira]], featuring instruments like [[berimbau]], [[pandeiro]], [[atabaque]], [[agogô]], and [[reco-reco]]. The music plays a crucial role in capoeira ''[[roda (dancing)|roda]]'', setting the style the energy of a game.\n\nMusic in the context of capoeira is used to create a sacred space through both the physical act of forming a circle (''[[roda (dancing)|roda]]'') and an aural space that is believed to connect to the spirit world. This deeper religious significance exists more as a social memory to most capoeira groups, but is generally understood as evidenced in the use of [[ngoma drums]] (the [[atabaque]]s of [[candomblé]]), and the berimbau whose earlier forms were used in African rituals to speak with the ancestors.",
