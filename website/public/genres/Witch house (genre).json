  "description": "'''Witch house''' (also known, particularly early in the genre's emergence, as '''drag''' and '''haunted house''') is a [[microgenre]] of [[electronic music]] that is musically characterized by high-pitched keyboard effects, heavily layered basslines and [[trap music|trap]]-style drum loops. Aesthetically, it employs [[occult]]- and [[Goth subculture|gothic]]-inspired themes.\n\nThe witch house visual aesthetic includes occultism, [[witchcraft]], [[shamanism]], terror- and [[Horror film|horror]]-inspired artworks, collages and photographs as well as significant use of [[hidden messages]] and typographic elements such as [[Unicode]] symbols. Artworks by witch house visual artists have incorporated imagery from horror films such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', the television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', and the fantasy show ''[[Charmed]]'', as well as mainstream [[pop culture]] celebrities of the 2000s. Common typographic elements in titles, such as by [[Salem (American band)|Salem]] and [[White Ring (band)|White Ring]], include triangles, crosses and [[Unicode]] symbols. These elements are seen by some as a method of [[gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeeping]] (in an effort to keep the scene [[Underground music|underground]] and more difficult to search for on the Internet).",
