  "description": "'''Mata-kantiga''' (from old [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], literally meaning, “kill the song”) is a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] genre of [[music]] of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] origin, very similar to other [[Music of Portugal|Portuguese folk music]], like the [[Desgarrada]] (Portugal), to [[Music of Brazil#Repente|Repente]], [[Cururu]] and [[Music of Brazil#Trova|Trova]] ([[Brazil]]).\n\nCultivated mainly in the area of [[Malacca]] (in [[Malaysia]]), it's a type of song where a man and a woman change improvised verses, divided generally in three types: romantic (''cantigas de amigo'', Portuguese for \"songs of friendship\"), mock (''cantigas de mal dizer'', Portuguese for \"songs of ill-saying\") and miscellaneous.\n\nIn the old days, some couples participated in sung duels and each partner used different verses ''mata-kantiga'' to seduce or to mock the other while the remaining hearing audience danced another sort of Malay music, also of Portuguese origin, called [[Branyo]].\n\nMata-kantiga was accompanied by the violin, rebana (small tambourine) and drum (of double face, Portuguese style). Currently in disuse, its last great exponent was the singer and poet [[Rosil de Costa]], deceased in 1986.\n\nA very similar sort of music genre, also of Portuguese influence and from the same region, called [[Dondang Sayang]] predominates nowadays."
