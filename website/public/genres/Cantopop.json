  "description": "'''Cantopop''' (a contraction of \"[[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] pop music\") is a genre of [[pop music]] sung in [[Cantonese]]. Cantopop is also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. The genre began in the 1970s and became associated with Hong Kong popular music from the middle of the decade. Cantopop then reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before slowly declining in the 2000s and shrinking in the 2010s. The term \"Cantopop\" itself was coined in 1978 after \"Cantorock\", a term first used in 1974. In the 1980s, Cantopop reached its highest glory with fanbase and concerts all over the world, especially in [[Macau]], [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]]. This was even more obvious with the influx of songs from [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong movies]] during the time.\n\nBesides [[Western culture|Western]] pop music, Cantopop is also influenced by other international genres, including [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[disco]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[ballad]] and others. Cantopop songs are almost invariably performed in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. Boasting a multi-national fanbase, the genre has gained popularity in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Additionally, it has found following in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in southeastern mainland China. Hong Kong remains as the significant hub of the genre.",
