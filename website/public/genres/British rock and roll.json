  "description": "'''British rock and roll''', or typeset as '''British rock 'n' roll''', is a style of popular music based on American [[rock and roll]], which emerged in the late 1950s and was popular until the arrival of [[beat music]] in 1962. It was important in establishing British youth and popular music culture and was a key factor in subsequent developments that led to the [[British Invasion]] of the mid-1960s. Since the 1960s, some stars of the genre, most notably [[Cliff Richard]], have managed to sustain successful careers and there have been periodic revivals of this form of music."
