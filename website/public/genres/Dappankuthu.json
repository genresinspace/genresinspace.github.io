It is one of several popular genres employed in film music, mainly in [[Tamil cinema]] and other South films, filmed and produced by people of [[Tamil culture]]. \nUnlike classical Indian dances such as [[bharatanatyam]] or [[kathakali]], dappankuthu is relatively informal in that it has no structured, repeated steps and dancers do not learn through formal dance classes. It shares its emphasis on percussion with older folk dances of [[Tamil Nadu]], such as [[kummi]] and kolattam.",
