  "description": "'''Ringbang''' is a [[Caribbean]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[music genre]]s propounded by [[Eddy Grant]] in 1994. \n\nIn an interview circa 2000, Grant defined ringbang like this:\n{{cquote|Ringbang is the thing that makes the soul quiet. That in a musical concept is [[rhythm]]. A child is given ringbang when a mother rocks it in her arms. Ringbang allowed the slaves to communicate. Ringbang is a bridge that allows us to stop being insular; it is a concept predicated on our being able to communicate with one another.<ref name=\"rollins\" />|1.5em|1.5em}}\n\nIn applying ringbang to music, Grant attempted to define a meta-style to encompass all Caribbean rhythms; it was to be a musical [[lingua franca]]. He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it. Among ringbang's stylistic influences are [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[tuk band|tuk]], and [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]].\n\nGrant says that the word \"ringbang\" comes from vocalists [[scat singing]] \"Ringa-ringa-ringbang!\". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in [[Trinidad]].",
