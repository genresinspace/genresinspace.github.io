  "description": "'''Champeta''', also known as '''terapia''', is a musical genre and dance that originated in the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]] in the early 1980s. It developed from an earlier style termed '''chalusonga''', which originated in [[Palenque de San Basilio]] in the mid-1970s. Chalusonga was a combination of Colombian chalupa and Afro-Cuban percussive music popularized by Estrellas del Caribe. When their music reached [[Cartagena de Indias]], it evolved into champeta, which became a movement and identity among Afro-Colombians. It shows influences from African colonial settlements and from contemporary African culture, particularly from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].",
