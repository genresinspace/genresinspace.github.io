  "description": "'''Post-Britpop''' is an [[alternative rock]] subgenre and is the period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, following [[Britpop]], when the media were identifying a \"new generation\" or \"second wave\" of guitar bands influenced by acts like [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], but with less overt British concerns in their lyrics and making more use of American rock and [[indie rock|indie]] influences, as well as experimental music. Bands in the post-Britpop era that had been established acts, but gained greater prominence after the decline of Britpop, such as [[Radiohead]] and [[the Verve]], and new acts such as [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[Snow Patrol (band)|Snow Patrol]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]], and particularly [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Coldplay]], achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.",
