  "description": "'''Nu-disco''' is a 21st-century [[dance music]] genre associated with a renewed interest in the late 1970s [[disco]], synthesizer-heavy 1980s European dance music styles, and early 1990s [[electronic dance music]]. The genre was popular in the early 2000s, and experienced a mild resurgence in the 2010s.\n\nThere are several scenes associated with the nu-disco term. The original scene is characterized as [[house music]] fused with disco elements (sometimes incorrectly referred to as [[disco house]]), and disco-influenced [[Balearic beat|balearic]] music, also known as ''balearic beat revival'' or ''balearica''.\n\nNu-disco is often confused with the other disco-influenced house music genres, such as [[French house]] or [[disco house]]. French house usually features various special effects, such as [[Phaser (effect)|phasers]] and has heavily sample-based production, compared to the usually programmed or live original instrumentation that nu-disco relies on. The other key difference is in the song structure â€” nu-disco usually has a typical song structure of a [[Pop music|pop]] or classic disco song, with multiple [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]], and often with verses and a chorus, whereas disco house generally has a more constant and unvaried character throughout the composition, as does most of house music.",
