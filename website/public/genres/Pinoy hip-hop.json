  "description": "'''Pinoy hip hop''', also called '''Filipino hip hop''' or '''Pinoy rap''', is hip hop music and culture produced in the Philippines and within the Filipino diaspora. Artists perform in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[English language|English]], and regional languages including [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], and [[Chavacano language|Chavacano]]. Hip hop practices reached the Philippines in the early 1980s through U.S. media, film, and exchanges around American military facilities and urban nightlife, and by the 1990s locally produced rap and DJ culture had a commercial presence alongside independent scenes.\n\nScholars note code-switching and multilingual performance as characteristic features, and point to links between Philippine scenes and Filipino American turntablism and production.",
