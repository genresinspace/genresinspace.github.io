  "description": "'''Nā mele paleoleo''' (literally \"songs that speak loudly and angrily\") is a Hawaiian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre that fuses [[rap]] with lyrics in the [[Hawaiian language]] and [[Hawaiian Pidgin]]. It emerged in Hawaii in the late 1980s as an expression of land struggles, cultural survival, social justice, and distrust of institutional power. Through protest performances it evolved into a recorded form in the 1990s tied strongly to the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]]. The term itself gained wider public use in that era and is associated with sovereignty-era advocacy. Recognized as a form of Hawaiian [[performance poetry]], nā mele paleoleo continues to serve as both artistic expression and political statement.",
