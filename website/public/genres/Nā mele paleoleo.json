  "description": "'''N훮 mele paleoleo''' ({{singular}} ''[[wikt:mele p훮leoleo#Hawaiian|mele p훮leoleo]]'' lit. \"song that speaks loudly and angrily\") is a Hawaiian [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre that fuses [[rap]] with lyrics in the [[Hawaiian language]], [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], or both. It emerged in Hawaii in the late 1980s as an expression of land struggles, cultural survival, social justice, and distrust of institutional power. Through protest performances it evolved into a recorded form in the 1990s tied strongly to the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]]. The term itself gained wider public use in that era and is associated with sovereignty-era advocacy. Recognized as a form of Hawaiian [[performance poetry]], n훮 mele paleoleo continues to serve as both artistic expression and political statement.",
