  "description": "'''Kaiso''' is a type of music popular in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and other countries, especially of the Caribbean, such as [[Grenada]], [[Belize]], [[Barbados]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[Dominica]], which originated in [[West Africa]] particularly among the [[Efik people|Efik]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] people of [[Nigeria]], and later evolved into [[calypso music]].\n\nKaiso music has its origins in West Africa (particularly in present-day [[Nigeria]]) and in the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] and was brought over by the enslaved Africans, who (in the early history of the art form) used it to sing about their masters. The people would also gather in \"kaiso\" tents where a [[griot]] or lead singer would lead them in song. Many early kaisos were sung in [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]] by an individual called a [[chantwell]]. Kaiso songs are generally narrative in form and often have a cleverly concealed political subtext. Kaiso performers are known as '''kaisonians'''.\n\nIn Barbados, ''kaiso'' refers to a form of stage-presented calypso, such as at the [[crop over]] festival.",
