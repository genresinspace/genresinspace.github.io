  "description": "'''Borgeets''' ({{langx|as|বৰগীত|lit=songs celestial|translit=Borgeet}}) are a collection of lyrical songs that are set to specific [[raga]]s but not necessarily to any [[tala (music)|tala]].  These  songs, composed by [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] and [[Madhavdeva]] in the 15th-16th centuries, are used to begin prayer services in [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|monasteries]], e.g. [[Satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|Satra]] and [[Namghar]] associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]]; and they also belong to the repertoire of [[Music of Meghalaya]] outside the religious context. They are a lyrical strain that express the religious sentiments of the poets reacting to different situations, and differ from other lyrics associated with the [[Ekasarana Dharma]].  Similar songs composed by others are not generally considered {{transliteration|ass|italic=no|borgeets}}.\n\nThe first Borgeet was composed by Srimanta Sankardeva during his first pilgrimage at [[Badrinath|Badrikashram]] in 1488 C.E., which is contemporaneous to the birth of [[Dhrupad]] in the court of [[Man Singh Tomar]] (1486-1518) of Gwalior.\nThe Borgeets are written in [[Brajavali dialect]] that is distinct from the Brajabuli used in Orissa and Bengal—it is a language where Maithili inflections were added to Assamese vocables and poruniciations— created by Shankardev and Madhabdev.",
