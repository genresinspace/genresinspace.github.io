  "description": "'''Palingsound''' ({{IPAc-en|p|a:|l|ɪ|ŋ|s|aʊ|n|t}}; {{abbrlink|lit.|literal translation}} 'European eel sound') is the unique musical sound attributed to a subgenre of [[Nederpop|Dutch pop music]] called palingpop ('Eel Pop'). 'Palingsound' is also frequently used as a synonym for the genre '''palingpop''' as a whole. The term references the origin of many of the artists making music this way, the (eel) fisherman's town of [[Volendam]]. Palingsound refers to a smooth melodic and sometimes sentimental sound, with close vocal harmonies, combined with matching arrangements and a studio mixing style.",
