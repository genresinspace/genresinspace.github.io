  "description": "'''Southern gospel music''' is a genre of [[Christian music]]. Its name comes from its origins in the [[southeastern United States]]. Its lyrics are written to express either personal or a communal faith regarding [[biblical]] teachings and [[Christianity|Christian]] life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream [[secular music]]. Sometimes known as \"[[quartet]] music\" for its traditional \"four men and a piano\" set up, southern gospel has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas, especially among [[baby boomers]] and those living in the [[Southern United States]]. Like other forms of music, the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to the cultural and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.",
