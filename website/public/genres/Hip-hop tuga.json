  "description": "'''Portuguese hip hop''' (''Hip hop português''), more commonly called '''hip hop tuga''' (\"tuga\" here being a slang for \"Portuguese\"), is the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] variety of [[hip hop music]]. It differs from mainstream hip hop because it has strong influences from African music, from [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Lusophone Africa]], [[reggae]], [[Zouk (musical movement)|zouk]] and [[fado]]{{according to whom|date=November 2021}}{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}.\n\nArtists such as [[Valete]], Lancelot and [[Sam the Kid]] are among the most popular. Old school Portuguese hip hop artists include [[General D]], Chullage, [[Boss AC]], [[Mind Da Gap]], [[Dealema]], Fuse, Mundo Segundo, Regula, [[Da Weasel]], Allen Halloween and Sir Scratch.\n\n\n\nThe founder of hip hop tuga was rapper [[General D]]{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}. Born in Maputo, Mozambique, General D moved to Lisbon at a young age and, even though he held a Portuguese passport and was heavily influenced by American rap, he always merged his music with his own Mozambican roots. He was the first rap-oriented artist of any kind to have a legitimate recording contract in Portugal. In 1994, he signed with [[Valentim de Carvalho]], a Portuguese division of [[EMI Records]], with whom he recorded two albums: ''Pé Na Tchôn, Karapinha Na Céu'' (1995) and ''Kanimabo'' (1997). Intelligent and charismatic, the general public and media liked General D., even though his lyrics were often very [[anti-establishment]].\n\nCalifornian hip hop artist and poet [[Ithaka (artist)|Ithaka]] (also known as: Ithaka Darin Pappas) is often included in the hip hop tuga community because he lived and recorded in Lisbon during 1992-1998 and was among the first wave of artists working with hip hop in Portugal. There he completed his first two (of eight) albums; ''[[Flowers and the Color of Paint]]'' (1995) and ''[[Stellafly]]'' (1997). His 1995 song \"Escape from the City of Angels\" (featuring Lisbon's [[Marta Dias]]) was included in the soundtrack of [[Antoine Fuqua]]'s U.S. feature film directorial debut ''[[The Replacement Killers]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures]]) starring [[Chow Yun Fat]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] and [[Michael Rooker]].\nThe song also appeared on the show ''[[Good Girls Don't (TV series)|Good Girl's Don't]]'' on [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oxygen Channel]].\n\nIn a 2017 article in ''Rimas e Batidas'' titled \"Os Álbuns Mais caros Do Hip Hop Português\" (\"''The Most Expensive Portuguese Hip Hop Albums''\"), the journalist Hugo Jorge explains that the most sought after and used hip hop tuga records were made by Da Weasel, Fuse, [[Orelha Negra]], Mind Da Gap, Micro, XEG, Mundo Segundo, Dealema and DJ Bomberjack.\n\nThe new school rapper [[Piruka]] has the most watched hip hop tuga song on [[YouTube]], which is \"Se Eu Não Acordar Amanhã\".",
