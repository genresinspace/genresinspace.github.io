  "description": "'''Eurodisco''' (also spelled as '''Euro disco''') is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that evolved from [[disco]] in the middle 1970s, incorporating elements of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] into a disco-like continuous dance atmosphere. Many Eurodisco compositions feature lyrics sung in English, although the singers often share a different [[First language|mother tongue]].\n\nEurodisco derivatives generally include [[Europop]] and [[Eurodance]], with the most prominent sub-genres being [[space disco]] of the late 1970s and [[Italo disco]] of the early 1980s. The genre declined in popularity after 1990 in preference to [[house music|house]] and [[eurodance]].",
