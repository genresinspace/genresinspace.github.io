  "description": "'''Hypnagogic pop''' (or simply '''h-pop''') is a loosely defined style of [[pop music|pop]] and [[psychedelic music]] that evokes [[cultural memory]] and [[nostalgia]] for the [[popular entertainment]] of the past  (principally the 1980s). It emerged in the mid to late 2000s out of the American [[post-noise]] underground as [[Generation X|Gen X]] [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] and [[Noise music|noise]] musicians began adopting [[retro]] aesthetics from their childhood, such as [[mainstream rock|radio]] and [[soft rock]], [[new wave music]], [[video game music]], [[synth-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]. Recordings were typically marked by the use of outmoded [[analog recording|analog]] equipment and [[do it yourself|DIY]] experimentation, while distributed on [[audio cassette|cassettes]] and [[CD-R]]'s with circulation primarily based on the [[Internet]] through [[Blog site|blog sites]]. \n\nThe genre's name was coined by journalist [[David Keenan]] in an August 2009 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' to label the developing trend, which he characterized as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\"  It was used interchangeably with \"[[chillwave]]\" or \"[[glo-fi]]\" and gained critical attention through artists such as [[Ariel Pink]] and [[James Ferraro]]. The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of [[psychedelia]], a reappropriation of media-saturated [[capitalist]] culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British [[hauntology (music)|hauntology]].\n\nIn response to Keenan's article, ''The Wire'' received a \"slew of semi-[[hate mail]]\" that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\". Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists. During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned,{{Citation needed|date=December 2025}} although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural [[zeitgeist]]s. Elements of hypnagogic pop evolved into [[vaporwave]], with which it is sometimes conflated.",
