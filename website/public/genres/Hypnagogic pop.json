  "description": "'''Hypnagogic pop''' (or simply '''h-pop''') is a loosely defined style of [[pop music|pop]] and [[psychedelic music]] that evokes [[cultural memory]] and [[nostalgia]] for the [[popular entertainment]] of the past (principally the 1980s and early 1990s). It emerged in the 2000s through a wave of American [[Millennials|Millennial]] [[home recording]] artists in the [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] and [[post-noise]] scene, who adopted [[retro]] aesthetics from their childhood, such as [[mainstream rock|radio]] and [[soft rock]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[video game music]], [[synth-pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and early [[Internet]] aesthetics. Recordings were typically marked by the use of outmoded [[analog recording|analog]] equipment and [[do it yourself|DIY]] experimentation, while distributed on [[audio cassette|cassettes]] and [[CD-R]]'s with circulation primarily based on the Internet through [[Blog site|blog sites]]. \n\nThe genre's name was coined by journalist [[David Keenan]] in an August 2009 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' to label the developing trend, the term was inspired by a comment made by musician [[James Ferraro]] about the notion that 1980s sounds had seeped into the unconscious of contemporary musicians while they were toddlers falling asleep. Keenan characterized the concept as \"pop music refracted through the memory of a memory.\" It was used interchangeably with \"[[chillwave]]\" or \"[[glo-fi]]\" and gained critical attention through artists such as [[Ariel Pink]] and James Ferraro. The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of [[psychedelia]], a reappropriation of media-saturated [[capitalist]] culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British [[hauntology (music)|hauntology]]. {{Psychedelic sidebar|Arts}}\n\nIn response to Keenan's article, ''The Wire'' received a \"slew of semi-[[hate mail]]\" that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\". Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists. During the 2010s, the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural [[zeitgeist]]s. The scene influenced the rise of [[bedroom pop]], while elements evolved into [[vaporwave]], with which it is sometimes conflated.",
