  "description": "'''Technical death metal''' (also known as '''tech death''') is a musical subgenre of [[death metal]] with particular focus on instrumental skill and complex songwriting. Technical and progressive experimentation in death metal began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, largely driven by four bands that, according to [[Allmusic]], are \"technical death metal's Big Four\" â€“ [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], and [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. All but Pestilence are part of the [[Florida death metal]] scene, to which [[Nocturnus]], another influential band, also belongs."
