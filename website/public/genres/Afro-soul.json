  "description": "'''Afro-soul''' is a genre of music that blends elements of [[soul music]] with [[African rhythms]] and instrumentation. It combines emotive vocal styles and lyrical themes characteristic of soul with traditional African musical elements, including indigenous rhythms, percussion instruments such as [[drum]]s and [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], and local languages or dialects.\n\nWhile artists such as South African singer [[Miriam Makeba]] helped popularize soul-influenced African music in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \"Afro-soul\" has been more commonly used in later decades to describe a range of contemporary artists across Africa. The genre has since grown in popularity across the continent and internationally, often overlapping with styles like [[Afrobeat]], [[Neo soul|neo-soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].",
