  "description": "'''Sapphic pop''' is a term used to describe a particular subgenre of [[indie music]] and [[bedroom pop]]. The genre typically has female, often [[femme]], singer-songwriters and will often feature lyrical themes such as [[lesbian]] or [[queer]] love.\n\nThe name of the subgenre derives from [[Terminology of homosexuality#Sapphism|sapphism]].\n\n[[Phoebe Bridgers]], [[Chappell Roan]], [[Muna (band)|Muna]], [[Tegan and Sara]], [[Clairo]], [[Girl in Red]], and [[King Princess]] have been cited as examples of the genre. \nAdditionally, some songs have been described as \"sapphic [[anthem]]s\". For example, Muna and Phoebe Bridgers' song \"Silk Chiffon\", [[G Flip]] and [[mxmtoon]]'s song \"Queen\", and \"[[Good Luck, Babe!]]\" by Chappell Roan.\n\nMeanwhile, artists such as Gemma Laurence have called their music \"sapphic folk\".",
