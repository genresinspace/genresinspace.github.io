  "description": "'''Power electronics''' is a style of [[noise music]] that typically consists of static, screeching waves of feedback, analogue synthesizers making sub-bass pulses or high frequency squealing sounds, with sometimes screamed and distorted vocals. The genre is noted for its influence from [[industrial music|industrial]], and is occasionally also referred to as heavy electronics.\n\nLike most noise music, power electronics is generally [[Atonality|atonal]] and features a lack of conventional melody or rhythm. To match its sonic excess, it often includes thematic and visual content that might be considered extreme; whether in [[lyrics]], artwork, or live performance. It has been known to invite visceral reactions from both listeners and critics, although many choose to dismiss or ignore it altogether. Power electronics is related to the early [[Industrial Records]] scene, but later releases had more in common with [[noise music]]."
