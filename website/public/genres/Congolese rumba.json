  "description": "'''Congolese rumba''', also known as '''African rumba''', is a [[dance music]] genre originating from the [[Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[French Congo]]) and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]). With its [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|rhythms]], [[Melody|melodies]], and lyrics, Congolese rumba has gained global recognition and remains an integral part of [[Music of Africa|African music heritage]]. In December 2021, it was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage]]. Known for its rhythmic patterns, guitar solos, and emotive vocals—primarily performed in [[Lingala]], though also in French, [[Kongo language|Kikongo]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Luban languages|Luba]]—the genre is defined by its multilayered, [[Cyclic form|cyclical]] guitar [[riff]]s, a [[rhythm section]] anchored by [[Bass guitar|electric bass]] and percussion, and the [[sebene]]: a high-energy instrumental bridge that inspires both dancers and [[atalaku]] (hype men).\n\nEmerging in the mid-20th century in the urban centers of [[Brazzaville]] and Léopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]]) during the colonial era, the genre's roots can be traced to the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] [[partner dance]] music known as ''maringa'', which was traditionally practiced within the former [[Kingdom of Loango]], encompassing regions of contemporary [[Republic of the Congo]], southern [[Gabon]], and [[Cabinda Province]] of Angola. The style gained prominence in the 1920s–1940s, introducing the advent of the \"[[Dance bar|bar-dancing]]\" culture in Brazzaville and Léopoldville, which incorporated distinctive elements such as a [[bass drum]], a bottle employed as a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and an [[accordion]] known as ''likembe''. During the mid-1940s and 1950s, the influence of [[Son cubano|Cuban son]] bands transformed ''maringa'' into \"Congolese rumba\", as imported records by [[Sexteto Habanero]], [[Trio Matamoros]], and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were frequently misattributed as \"rumba\". The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of [[soukous]], an urban dance music style that emanated from Congolese rumba, imbuing it with lively rhythms, intricate high-pitched guitar melodies, and large brass and [[polyrhythm]]ic percussion sections. Soukous gradually incorporated modern musical trends, paving the way for [[ndombolo]], which emerged in the late 1990s and adopted contemporary production techniques, adding [[synthesizer]]s and [[Music technology (electronic and digital)|digital sound technologies]] to appeal to new generations.\n\nThe style has gained popularity across [[Central Africa|central]], [[East Africa|eastern]], [[Southern Africa|southern]], and [[West Africa|western Africa]], where it is regarded as the \"origin of all subsequent [[Music of West Africa|West African musical]] movements\". Additionally, it has found a following in Europe, particularly in France, Belgium, Germany, and the UK, as well as in the US, as a result of touring by Congolese musicians, who have performed at various festivals internationally. Musicians such as [[Paul Kamba]], [[Henri Bowane]], [[Wendo Kolosoy]], [[Manuel d'Oliveira]], [[Léon Bukasa]], [[Franco Luambo|Franco Luambo Makiadi]], [[Le Grand Kallé]], [[Nico Kasanda]], [[Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta]], [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]], [[Sam Mangwana]], [[Papa Noël Nedule]], [[Vicky Longomba]], [[Zaïko Langa Langa]], [[Papa Wemba]], and [[Koffi Olomide]] have made significant contributions to the genre, pushing its boundaries and incorporating modern musical elements.",
