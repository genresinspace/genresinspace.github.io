  "description": "'''Turbo-folk''' is a subgenre of contemporary [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] pop music that initially developed in [[Serbia]] during the 1990s as a fusion of [[techno]] and [[folk music|folk]]. The term \"turbo-folk\" was coined by [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] singer [[Rambo Amadeus]], who jokingly used it to describe an aggressive, satirical style of music. While primarily associated with Serbia, this style is also popular in other former Yugoslav nations. A widely cited 2011 article from [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] described turbo-folk as \"{{Lang|de|Musik für Idioten}}\" (\"music for idiots\").",
