  "description": "'''Chopped and screwed''' (also called '''screwed and chopped''' or '''slowed and throwed''') is a genre of hip-hop music and technique of [[remix]]ing music that involves slowing down the tempo and [[DJing]]. It was pioneered by [[DJ Screw]], and became a staple in the [[Houston]] [[hip hop]] scene in the 1990's. The screwed technique involves slowing the [[tempo]] of a song down to 60 and 70 [[quarter-note]] [[beats per minute]] and applying techniques such as skipping beats, record [[scratching]], [[stop-time]] and affecting portions of the original composition to create a \"chopped-up\" variant of the material."
