  "description": "'''Pop-punk''' (also '''punk-pop''', alternatively spelled without the hyphen) is a [[rock music]] genre that combines elements of [[punk rock]] with [[power pop]] or [[pop music|pop]]. It is defined by its fast-paced, energetic tempos, and emphasis on classic pop songcraft, as well as [[Adolescence|adolescent]] and anti-[[suburb]]ia themes. It is distinguished from other punk-variant genres by drawing more heavily from 1960s bands such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Kinks]], and [[the Beach Boys]]. The genre has evolved throughout its history, absorbing elements from [[new wave music|new wave]], [[college rock]], [[ska]], [[Hip-hop|hip hop]], [[emo]], [[boy band]] pop and even [[hardcore punk]] and [[metalcore]]. It is sometimes considered interchangeable with power pop and [[skate punk]].\n\nThe genre's roots are found during the late 1970s with groups such as the [[Ramones]], [[the Undertones]], and [[Buzzcocks]] setting its initial groundwork. 1980s punk bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Descendents]] and [[the Misfits (band)|the Misfits]], while not necessarily pop-punk in and of themselves, were influential to pop-punk, and it expanded in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a host of bands signed to [[Lookout Records|Lookout! Records]], including [[Screeching Weasel]], [[the Queers]], and [[the Mr. T Experience]], becoming a foundational stage. In the mid-1990s, the genre saw a widespread popularity increase and entered the mainstream with bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]]. The genre experienced a second wave that cemented the late 1990s and early 2000s led by [[Blink-182]], and in their wake followed contemporary acts such as [[Sum 41]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Good Charlotte]], and [[Avril Lavigne]], while the [[Warped Tour]] played a crucial role in launching up-and-coming pop-punk artists.\n\nPop-punk's mainstream popularity continued in the mid-to-late 2000s, with artists such as [[Fall Out Boy]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and [[Paramore]] achieving high levels of commercial success. By this point, pop-punk acts were largely indistinguishable from artists tagged as \"emo\", to the extent that emo crossover acts such as Fall Out Boy and Paramore popularized a pop-punk-influenced style dubbed [[emo pop]]. By the 2010s, pop-punk's mainstream popularity had waned, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. During this period, however, a wave of underground artists defined a rawer and more emotional take on the genre, namely [[The Story So Far (band)|the Story so Far]], [[the Wonder Years (band)|the Wonder Years]] and [[Neck Deep]]. In the early 2020s, a new crop of pop-punk music began experiencing mainstream resurgence with various new acts such as [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[KennyHoopla]] and [[Yungblud]].",
