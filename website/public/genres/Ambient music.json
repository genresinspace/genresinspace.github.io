  "description": "'''Ambient music''' is a [[genre of music]] that emphasizes [[Musical tone|tone]] and atmosphere over traditional [[Musical form|musical structure]] or [[rhythm]]. Often \"peaceful\" sounding and lacking [[Musical composition|composition]], beat, and/or structured [[melody]], ambient music uses textural layers of sound that can reward both passive and active listening, and encourage a sense of calm or contemplation. The genre evokes an \"atmospheric\", \"visual\", or \"unobtrusive\" quality. [[Nature]] [[soundscape]]s may be included, and some works use [[sustain]]ed or [[repetition (music)|repeated]] notes, as in [[drone music]]. Bearing elements associated with [[new-age music]], [[acoustic music|instruments]] such as the [[piano]], [[string section|strings]] and [[flute]] may be emulated through a [[synthesizer]].\n\nThe genre originated in the 1960s and 1970s, when new musical instruments were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. It was presaged by [[Erik Satie]]'s [[furniture music]] and styles such as [[musique concrète]], [[minimal music]], Jamaican [[dub music]] and German [[electronic music]], but was prominently named and popularized by British musician [[Brian Eno]] in 1978 with his album ''[[Ambient 1: Music for Airports]]''; Eno opined that ambient music \"must be as ignorable as it is interesting\", however, in early years, there were artists that were pioneers in this genre, like [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Kraftwerk]], etc. It saw a revival towards the late 1980s with the prominence of house and [[techno music]], growing a [[cult following]] by the 1990s.\n\nAmbient music has not achieved large commercial success. Nevertheless, it has attained a certain degree of acclaim throughout the years, especially in the [[Information Age|Internet age]]. Due to its relatively open style, ambient music often takes influences from many other genres, ranging from [[classical music|classical]], [[avant-garde music]], [[experimental music]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz music|jazz]], and [[world music]], amongst others.",
