  "description": "'''Groove metal''', sometimes also called '''neo-thrash''' or '''post-thrash''', is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] that began in the early 1990s. The genre is primarily derived from [[thrash metal]], but played in slower tempos, and making use of rhythmic guitar parts. It was pioneered in the late 1980s by groups like [[Exhorder]], [[Prong (band)|Prong]] and [[Bad Brains]], and then popularized by the commercial success of [[Pantera]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] and [[Sepultura]]. The genre went on to be influential in the development of the [[new wave of American heavy metal]], [[nu metal]] and [[metalcore]], and continued to gain traction in the 2000s with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[DevilDriver]] and [[Five Finger Death Punch]], and 2010s with [[Killer Be Killed]] and [[Bad Wolves]].",
