  "description": "'''Post-punk''' is a [[subgenre]] and era of [[rock music]] that emerged in late 1977 in the wake of [[punk rock]]. The concept was originally outlined by [[Jon Savage]] in his \"[[New musick|New Musick]]\" editorial for [[Sounds (magazine)|''Sounds'']] magazine in November 1977. The term has been noted for lacking a universally agreed-upon definition. Post-punk musicians departed from punk's fundamental elements and raw simplicity, adopting instead a broader, more experimental approach that incorporated a variety of [[avant-garde]] sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and [[Do it yourself ethic|DIY]] ethic but determined to move beyond rock clichés, artists drew influence from German [[krautrock]] and experimented with styles such as [[funk]], [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], and [[dance music]]; the production techniques of [[Dub music|dub]] and [[disco]]; and ideas from [[modernist art]], [[Film|cinema]], [[Modernist literature|literature]], and politics. They also established [[independent record labels]], created visual art, staged multimedia performances, and produced [[fanzines]]. Among the early post-punk bands, only [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Public Image Ltd.]] achieved commercial success in 1978, with debut singles reaching the top ten of the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Chart]].\n\nRegional scenes developed across Europe alongside [[new wave music]], the most notable being the Netherlands' [[Ultra (music)|Ultra]] movement, Germany's [[Neue Deutsche Welle]], Spain's [[La Movida Madrileña]], and the [[Cold wave (music)|coldwave]] scenes in France, Poland, and Belgium, as well as the [[Soviet post-punk|Soviet]] and [[Yugoslav New Wave|Yugoslav new wave]]. The original post-punk era emerged in parallel with the [[no wave]] and [[industrial music|industrial]] music scenes, and later provided a foundation for British [[new pop]] and the [[Second British Invasion]] in the United States. Post-punk also influenced the development of numerous [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie rock|independent]] music genres, including [[gothic rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[dark wave]], [[dance-punk]], [[jangle pop]], [[ethereal wave]], [[dream pop]], and [[shoegaze]]. By the mid-to-late 1980s, post-punk had largely dissipated.\n\nDuring the 2000s, several New York bands incorporated post-punk influences into contemporary [[indie rock]], leading to the [[dance-punk]] and [[post-punk revival]]. By the 2010s, Canadian, Irish, Danish and American post-punk acts later inspired London's [[Windmill scene]] and \"crank wave\", while post-punk became briefly associated with the internet [[microgenre]] \"[[doomer wave]]\" in the early 2020s. Around the same time, regional scenes developed in Russia and Latin America.",
