  "description": "'''Post-punk''' (originally known as '''new musick''') is a [[subgenre]] and era of [[rock music]] that emerged in late 1977 in the wake of [[punk rock]]. The term was coined by English journalist [[Jon Savage]] in November 1977. Post-punk musicians departed from punk's fundamental elements and raw simplicity, instead adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a variety of [[avant-garde]] sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and [[do it yourself ethic]] but determined to break from rock [[cliche]]s, artists drew influence from German [[krautrock]] and experimented with styles like [[funk]], [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], and [[dance music]]; the [[music production|production techniques]] of [[dub music|dub]] and [[disco]]; and ideas from art and politics, including [[modernist art]], [[Film|cinema]], and [[modernist literature|literature]]. These communities produced [[independent record labels]], visual art, [[multimedia]] performances and [[fanzines]].  \n\nBy the mid-1980s, post-punk had dissipated; however, regional scenes developed across Europe alongside [[new wave music]], most notable were the Netherlands' [[Ultra (music)|Ultra]], Germany's [[Neue Deutsche Welle]], Spain's [[La Movida Madrileña]], France, Poland and Belgium's [[Cold wave (music)|coldwave]], as well as the [[Soviet post-punk]] scene. The original post-punk era emerged alongside the [[no wave]] and [[industrial music]] scenes and later provided a foundation for the British [[new pop]] movement and the development of several [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Indie rock|independent]] music genres such as [[gothic rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[dark wave]], [[dance-punk]], [[jangle pop]], [[ethereal wave]], [[dream pop]], [[shoegaze]] and more.  \n\nDuring the 2000s, New York bands incorporated post-punk influences with contemporary [[indie rock]], which led to the [[post-punk revival]]. By the 2010s, Canadian, Irish, Danish and American post-punk bands later inspired the “[[crank wave]]” movement and London's [[Windmill scene]], while post-punk also became briefly associated with the internet [[microgenre]] \"[[doomer wave]]\" during the early 2020s. Contemporaneous regional scenes further developed in Russia and Latin America.",
