  "description": "'''Post-punk''' (originally known as '''new musick''') is a broad genre of music that emerged in late 1977 in the wake of [[punk rock]]. The term was coined by [[Jon Savage]] in November 1977. Post-punk musicians departed from punk's fundamental elements and raw simplicity, instead adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a variety of [[avant-garde]] sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and [[do it yourself ethic]] but determined to break from rock [[cliche]]s, artists drew influence from Germany's [[krautrock]] scene and experimented with styles like [[funk]], [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], and [[dance music]]; the [[music production|production techniques]] of [[dub music|dub]] and [[disco]]; and ideas from art and politics, including [[modernist art]], [[Film|cinema]], and [[modernist literature|literature]]. These communities produced [[independent record labels]], visual art, [[multimedia]] performances, and [[fanzines]].\n\nThe early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups including [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Public Image Ltd]], [[the Pop Group]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Joy Division]], [[Talking Heads]], [[the Raincoats]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[the Cure]], and [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]. The movement was closely related to the development of ancillary genres such as [[gothic rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[no wave]], and [[industrial music]]. By the mid-1980s, post-punk had dissipated; however, it provided a foundation for the [[new pop]]  movement and the later [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[indie rock|independent]] genres.",
