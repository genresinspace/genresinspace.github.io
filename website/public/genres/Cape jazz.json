  "description": "'''Cape jazz''' is a genre of jazz that is performed in the very southern part of Africa, the name being a reference to [[Cape Town]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]. Some writers say that Cape jazz began to emerge in 1959 with the formation of [[The Jazz Epistles]], many of whom were from Cape Town, including [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], then known as Dollar Brand. Cape jazz is similar to the popular music style known as [[marabi]], though more improvisational in character. Where marabi is a piano jazz style, Cape jazz in the beginning featured (though not exclusively) instruments that can be carried in a street parade, such as brass instruments, banjos, guitars and percussion instruments.",
