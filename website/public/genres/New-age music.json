  "description": "'''New-age''' is a genre of music intended to create [[artistic inspiration]], [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], and [[optimism]]. It is used by listeners for [[yoga]], [[massage]], [[meditation]], and reading as a method of [[stress management]] to bring about a state of [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] rather than [[trance]],{{sfn|Marini|2003|p=169}}{{sfn|Whittall|2003|p=184}} or to create a peaceful atmosphere in homes or other environments. It is sometimes associated with [[environmentalism]] and [[New Age|New Age spirituality]];{{sfn|Newport|1998|p=475–483}} however, most of its artists have nothing to do with \"New Age spirituality\", and some even reject the term.{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}}\n\nNew-age music includes both [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] forms, featuring instruments such as [[flute]]s, [[piano]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[folk instrument|non-Western acoustic instruments]], while also engaging with [[electronic music|electronic]] forms, frequently relying on sustained [[synth pad]]s or long [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]-based runs. New-age artists often combine these approaches to create [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] music. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved, vocals have become more common, especially those featuring [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]-, [[Sanskrit]]-, or [[Tibetan Music|Tibetan]]-influenced chants, or lyrics based on [[mythology]] such as [[Celtic mythology|Celtic legends]].{{sfn|Newport|1998|p=475–479}}{{sfn|Hale and Payton|2000|p=26}}{{sfn|Shuker|2002|p=212}}\n\nThere is no exact definition of new-age music. However, it is often judged by its intent according to the Grammy screening committee in that category.{{sfn|Hale and Payton|2000|p=26}} An article in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in 1987 commented that \"New Age music may be the most startling successful non-defined music ever to hit the public consciousness\".{{sfn|Newport|1998|p=476}}  Many consider it to be an [[umbrella term]] for marketing rather than a musical category,{{sfn|Shuker|2002|p=212}} and to be part of a complex cultural trend.{{sfn|Newport|1998|p=476, 478}}\n\nNew-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. [[Tony Scott (musician)|Tony Scott]]'s ''[[Music for Zen Meditation]]'' (1964) is considered the first new-age recording. [[Paul Horn (musician)|Paul Horn]] (beginning with 1968's [[Inside (Paul Horn album)|''Inside'']]) was one of the important predecessors. [[Irv Teibel]]'s ''[[Environments (series)|Environments]]'' series (1969–1979) featured natural [[soundscape]]s, [[Tintinnabulum|tintinnabulation]], and \"[[Om]]\" chants and were some of the first publicly available [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustic]] recordings. [[Steven Halpern]]'s 1975 ''Spectrum Suite'' was a key work that began the new-age music movement.",
