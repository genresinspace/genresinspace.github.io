  "description": "'''Christian alternative rock''' is a form of [[alternative rock]] music that is lyrically grounded in a [[Christianity|Christian]] worldview. Some critics have suggested that unlike [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] and older [[Christian rock]], Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic, though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.",
