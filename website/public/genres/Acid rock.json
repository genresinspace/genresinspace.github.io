  "description": "'''Acid rock''' is a loosely defined type of [[rock music]]{{sfn|Browne|Browne|2001|p=8}} that evolved out of the mid-1960s [[garage rock|garage <!----The source in the article says \"garage punk\", which is a valid term for the 1960s genre. If you want to change this to \"rock\", you will have to provide a reliable source.--->punk]]{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=1725}} movement and helped launch the [[psychedelia|psychedelic subculture]]. While the term has sometimes been used interchangeably with \"[[psychedelic rock]]\", acid rock also specifically refers to a more musically intense, rawer, or heavier subgenre or sibling of psychedelic rock. Named after [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD), the style is generally defined by heavy, [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars and often contains lyrics with drug references and long improvised [[Jam session|jams]].  \n\nCompared to other forms of psychedelic rock, acid rock features a harder, louder, heavier, or rawer sound. Much of the style overlaps with [[Garage rock|1960s garage punk]], [[proto-metal]], and early heavy, [[blues]]-based [[hard rock]]. It developed mainly from the [[American West Coast]], where groups did not focus on the novelty recording effects or whimsy of British psychedelia; instead, the subgenre emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the [[psychedelic experience]].\n\nAs the movement progressed into the late 1960s and 1970s, elements of acid rock split into two directions, with hard rock and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] on one side and [[progressive rock]] on the other. In the 1990s, the [[stoner metal]] genre combined acid rock with other hard rock styles such as [[grunge]] and [[doom metal]], updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in acid rock and psychedelic-influenced metal.",
