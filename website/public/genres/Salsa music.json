  "description": "'''Salsa music''' is a style of [[Music of Latin America|Latin American music]], combining elements of [[Music of Cuba|Cuban]] and [[Music of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] influences. Because most of the basic musical components predate the labeling of salsa, there have been many controversies regarding its origin. Most songs considered as salsa are primarily based on [[son montuno]] and [[son cubano]], with elements of [[Cha-cha-chá (music)|cha-cha-chá]], [[bolero]], [[rumba]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], and [[plena]]. All of these elements are adapted to fit the basic Son montuno template when performed within the context of salsa.\n\nOriginally the name salsa was used to label commercially several styles of Hispanic Caribbean music, but nowadays it is considered a musical style on its own and one of the staples of [[Hispanic America]]n culture.\n\nThe first self-identified salsa band is Cheo Marquetti y su Conjunto - Los Salseros which was formed in 1955. The first album to mention Salsa on its cover was titled “Salsa” which was released by La Sonora Habanera in 1957. Later on self-identified salsa bands were predominantly assembled by [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] and [[Cubans|Cuban]] musicians in [[New York City]] in the 1970s. The music style was based on the late [[son montuno]] of [[Arsenio Rodríguez]], [[Conjunto Chappottín]] and [[Roberto Faz]]. These musicians included [[Celia Cruz]], [[Willie Colón]], [[Ruben Blades|Rubén Blades]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Machito]] and [[Hector Lavoe|Héctor Lavoe]]. \nDuring the same period a parallel modernization of [[Cuban son]] was being developed by [[Los Van Van]], [[Irakere]], [[NG La Banda]] under the name of [[Songo music|songo]], which further evolved into [[timba]] in the late 80s with artists like  [[Charanga Habanera]]; both styles are at present also labelled as salsa. Though limited by an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], the continuous cultural exchange between salsa-related musicians inside and outside of Cuba is undeniable.",
