  "description": "'''Roots rock''' is a genre of [[rock music]] that looks back to rock's origins in [[contemporary folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[country music]]. First emerging in the late 1960s, it is seen as a response to the perceived excesses of the then dominant [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and the developing [[progressive rock]]. Because ''roots music'' ([[Americana (music)|Americana]]) is often used to mean folk and [[world music|world]] musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. \n\nThe 2000s saw a new interest in \"roots\" music.
