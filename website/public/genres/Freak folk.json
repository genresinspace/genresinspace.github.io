  "description": "'''Freak folk''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[psychedelic folk]] associated with the 2000s [[New Weird America]] movement and used to describe the work of artists such as [[Joanna Newsom]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Animal Collective]], and [[Adem Ilhan|Adem]]. The term \"freak folk\" had been in informal use for decades before solidifying into a genre in the mid-2000s. The label was rejected by many of the contemporary artists whose music it was applied to.",
