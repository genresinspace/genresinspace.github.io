  "description": "'''Cuarteto''' ({{langx|es|quartet}}), sometimes called '''cuartetazo''', is a musical genre born in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Argentina]].\n\nThe roots of the cuarteto ensemble are in [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] dance ensembles. The name was coined because the early dance-hall numbers were invariably four-piece bands ([[violin]]-[[piano]]-[[accordion]]-[[Double bass|bass]]).\n\nCuarteto is almost always upbeat; its rhythm range is similar to that of modern [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[merengue (music)|merengue]].\n\nIn the 1970s, cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of Córdoba's cultural identity&mdash;together with ''Hortensia'' magazine. Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment, and proposed an alternative to the [[Buenos Aires]]-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country.\n\nCuarteto was one of the genres that gave birth to the Buenos Aires ''tropical'' scene, which was renamed as ''[[bailanta]]'' in the 1990s following the usage of [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes province]].",
