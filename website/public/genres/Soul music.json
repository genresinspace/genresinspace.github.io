  "description": "'''Soul music''' is a [[popular music]] genre that originated in [[African-American culture|African American]] [[African-American neighborhood|communities]] throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body movements, are an important hallmark of soul. Other characteristics are a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] between the lead and [[Backing vocalist|backing vocalists]],  an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music is known for reflecting African American identity and stressing the importance of [[African-American culture|African American culture]].\n  \nSoul has its roots in African-American [[gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]], and primarily combines elements of gospel, [[R&B]] and [[jazz]].  The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential in its  proliferation during the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]]. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]]. It had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre [[neo soul]], which incorporated modern production elements and [[hip-hop]] influences.\n\nSoul music dominated the U.S. [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B charts]] in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Many prominent soul artists, including [[Ray Charles]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Otis Redding]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and various acts under the Motown label, such as [[the Supremes]] and [[the Temptations]], were highly influential in the genre's development and all gained widespread popularity during this time. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists moved to [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more socially conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had begun to absorb influences from [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]], among other genres, leading to the creation of [[psychedelic soul]] and [[progressive soul]]. Prominent soul artists of this era include [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Al Green]], and [[Bill Withers]]. [[Neo soul]], which adopted hip-hop influences, emerged around 1994. \n\nOther subgenres of soul include the \"[[Motown#Motown sound|Motown sound]]\", a more rhythmic and [[pop music|pop]]-friendly style that originated from the eponymous label; [[Southern soul]], a driving, energetic variety combining R&B with southern gospel music influences; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which emerged from the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; and [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] variety with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals.",
