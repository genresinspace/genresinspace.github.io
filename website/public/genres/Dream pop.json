It often overlaps with the related genre of [[shoegaze]], and the two genre terms have at times been used interchangeably.\n\nThe genre came into prominence in the 1980s through groups associated with the UK label [[4AD]], most prominently [[Cocteau Twins]], [[This Mortal Coil]], and [[A.R. Kane]]. Subsequently, UK-based acts such as [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Slowdive]], and [[Lush (band)|Lush]] alongside US-based artists [[Galaxie 500]], [[Julee Cruise]], and [[Mazzy Star]] released significant albums in the style.
