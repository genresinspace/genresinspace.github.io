  "description": "'''Christian rock''' is a genre of [[rock music]] that features [[lyrics]] focusing on matters of [[Christian faith]], often with an emphasis on [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between [[Band (rock and pop)|bands]]. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the [[contemporary Christian music]] labels, media outlets, and [[Music festival|festivals]], while other bands are independent.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, [[Tooth & Nail Records]] became a catalyst in legitimizing Christian rock as a notable subgenre of [[alternative rock]]. Signing acts like [[Starflyer 59]] and [[MxPx]], Tooth & Nail helped make alternative rock immediately accessible within [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] church communities throughout the United States, and subsequently the wider [[Western world]] with the advent of [[Music streaming service|music streaming]].\n\nIn the 2000s and onwards, Christian rock bands [[Skillet (band)|Skillet]], [[Thousand Foot Krutch]], and [[Red (band)|Red]] were influenced by acts like [[Linkin Park]] to develop their own sounds that combined [[hard rock]] and [[nu metal]]. Skillet received [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for two albums, along with having two albums certified platinum and double platinum. Red also received Grammy nominations for two albums.",
