  "description": "'''Hard NRG''', '''nu-NRG''', '''filthy hard house''',{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}} or more recently just '''filth''', is an [[electronic dance music]] genre similar in structure (with regard to sequencing and programming) to [[UK hard house]] form, taking influences from German [[hard trance]]. The main difference is in the musical/thematic content of each style.\n\nWhere UK hard house has uplifting, playfully fun and tough elements, NRG is ominous, dark, aggressive and relentless with its distressed, menacing and gritty sounds on a slightly faster [[Beats per minute|BPM]] (155–165 average) than UK hard house (150–155 average).\n\nIn regard to the mechanics of the scene, many of the labels have made a shift from purely vinyl releases to CD single releases and digital downloads.\n\nRecord labels which produce the genre include Vicious Circle, Flashpoint, [[Tidy Trax]], Kaktai, Tonka Trax, Tinrib Digital, Noir Records and Noir Digital.",
