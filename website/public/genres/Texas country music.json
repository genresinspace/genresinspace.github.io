  "description": "'''Texas country music''' (more popularly known just as '''Texas country''' or '''Texas music''') is a subgenre of [[country music]] from [[Texas]]. Texas country is a style of [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] and is often associated with other distinct neighboring styles, including [[Red Dirt (music)|red dirt]] from [[Oklahoma]], the [[New Mexico music]] of [[New Mexico]], and [[Tejano music|Tejano]] in Texas, all of which have influenced one another over the years, and are popular throughout Texas, the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], and other parts of the [[Western United States]]. Texas country is known for fusing [[neotraditional country]] with the outspoken, care-free views of [[outlaw country]]. Texas country blends these sub-genres with a \"[[commoner|common working man]]\" theme and witty undertones, these often combine with a stripped down music sound.\n\nNeither the location of birth nor the location of upbringing seems to calculate in the definition of a Texas country artist, as long as the origin is not in the corporate Nashville scene as the genre tends to be anti-Nashville. The genre differentiates from Nashville country with its rejection of pop influences that is found in Nashville country recently, but does not necessarily mean the artist/group is Texas-based. For example, [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] is considered by some to be a Texas country musician, despite his [[Kentucky]] ties. [[Adam Hood]], an [[Alabama]] native, also has had success in the genre. Even international musicians, such as [[Alberta, Canada]] native [[Corb Lund]], have been successful in the Texas country scene.",
