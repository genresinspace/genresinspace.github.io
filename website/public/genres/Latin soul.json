  "description": "'''Latin soul''' (occasionally used synonymously with [[boogaloo]]) was a short-lived musical [[genre]] that had developed in the 1960s in [[New York City]]. It consisted of a blend of [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]] such as [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], along with elements of [[Latin jazz]] and [[soul music]]. Although short-lived, the genre had a very great influence on the growing [[salsa music|salsa]] movement which would dominate the New York Latin music scene in the 1970s. Today, the term is typically used for artists of [[Hispanic]] and [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] descent producing [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and/or [[soul music]].\n\nLatin soul heavily emphasized its Afro-Cuban rhythms and featured songs sung mainly in English. The style grew out of an attempt on the part of Latin musicians in New York City to expand the reach of their music beyond the local Latin community and into the broader mainstream American society.",
