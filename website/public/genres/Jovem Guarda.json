  "description": "'''Jovem Guarda''' was primarily a Brazilian musical television show first aired by [[Rede Record]] in 1965, although the term soon expanded to designate the entire movement and style surrounding it. The members of the program were singers who had been influenced by the American rock n' roll of the late 1950s and [[British Invasion]] bands of the 1960s, although the music often became softer, more naïve versions with light, romantic lyrics aimed at teenagers. They were [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Erasmo Carlos]] and [[Wanderléa]], with other bands and musicians appearing on the show as guests.\n\nThe style became popularly known as \"[[iê-iê-iê]]\", a term that, like French [[yé-yé]], is most likely based on the frequent \"yeah\" cries heard in songs of the period (for instance, the [[Beatles]]' \"She loves you/Yeah yeah yeah\"). Iê-iê-iê was often considered a lesser genre, inferior to the more sophisticated [[bossa nova]] and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] music of the period. Jovem Guarda also became a lucrative business thanks to merchandise that explored its theme and even a couple of themed motion pictures were shot during the period, thus reinforcing the idea of its lack of artistic integrity.\n\n[[Jorge Ben]] explored Jovem Guarda-style rock during the 1960s, fusing it with [[samba]] and [[R&B]], before his music's development into [[samba rock]].",
