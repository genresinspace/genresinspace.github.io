  "description": "'''Zouk''' is a musical movement and dance pioneered by the [[French Antilles|French Antillean]] band [[Kassav']] in the early 1980s. It was originally characterized by a fast tempo (120â€“145 [[beats per minute|bpm]]), a percussion-driven rhythm, and a loud horn section. Musicians from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] eventually added [[MIDI]] instrumentation to their [[compas]] style, which developed into a genre called zouk-love. Zouk-love is effectively the French [[Lesser Antilles]]' compas, and it gradually became indistinguishable from compas.",
