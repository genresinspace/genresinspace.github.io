  "description": "'''Indo pop''' ({{langx|id|Pop Indo}}), also known as '''Indonesian pop''' ({{Langx|id|Pop Indonesia}}) or '''I-pop''', is loosely defined as [[Indonesian music|Indonesian]] [[pop music]]; however, in a wider sense, it can also encompass Indonesian [[popular culture|pop culture]], which also includes [[Cinema of Indonesia|Indonesian cinema]] and ''[[sinetron]]s'' (Indonesian TV dramas).\n\n[[Indonesia]]n pop music today is sometimes influenced by trends and recordings from [[American popular music|Western music]]. However, in return, the Indonesian style of pop music has influenced the regional pop culture in Southeast Asia, especially the [[Malaysian pop]] scene that began imitating the Indonesian style of pop music in the late 2000s. Indo pop usually expresses contemporary Indonesian sentiments and lifestyles, generally about love and social life related to relationships. Indonesian pop music with sad and mellow melodies is popular and sells well.",
