  "description": "'''Gangsta rap''' or '''gangster rap''', initially called '''reality rap''', is a subgenre of [[rap music]] that conveys the culture, values, and experiences of urban gangs and [[Illegal drug trade|street hustlers]], frequently discussing unpleasant realities of the world in general through an urban lens. Emerging in the late 1980s, gangsta rap's pioneers include [[Schoolly D]] and [[Ice-T]], later expanding with artists such as [[N.W.A]]. In 1992, via record producer and rapper [[Dr. Dre]], rapper [[Snoop Dogg]], and their [[G-funk]] sound, gangster rap broadened to mainstream popularity.\n\nGangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealing]], as well as [[misogyny]], [[promiscuity]], and materialism. Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or [[police brutality]], and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including [[Spike Lee]], pastor [[Calvin O. Butts|Calvin Butts]] and activist [[C. Delores Tucker]]. Furthermore, in times of [[public security]] crisis, gangsta rap is scapegoated and boycotted as a malignant tumor, due to the general tenor of its lyrics.",
