  "description": "'''Thrashcore''' (also known as '''fastcore''') is a fast-[[tempo]] subgenre of [[hardcore punk]] that emerged in the early 1980s. Thrashcore is essentially sped-up hardcore, adopting a slightly more extreme style by means of its vocals, dissonance, and occasional use of [[blast beat]]s. Songs are usually very brief, and thrashcore is in many ways a less [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]], minimally [[Heavy metal music|metallic]] forerunner of [[grindcore]]. The genre is sometimes associated with the [[skate punk|skateboarder]] [[subculture]]."
