  "description": "'''Old-time music''' is a genre of [[North America]]n [[folk music]]. It developed along with various North American [[folk dance]]s, such as [[square dance|square dancing]], [[contra dance|contra dancing]] and [[buck dance|buck dancing]]. It is played on [[acoustic instrument]]s, generally centering on a combination of [[fiddle]] (see [[Old time fiddle|old time fiddling]]) and plucked [[string instrument]]s, most often the 5-string [[banjo]] without a resonator pan, [[guitar]], and [[mandolin]]. Together, they form an ensemble called the [[string band]], which along with the simple banjo–fiddle duet have historically been the most common configurations to play old-time music. The genre is considered by some to be a precursor to modern [[country music]], but it is also has a contemporary active subculture of musicians in various parts of the United States.  Old-time music can generally be distinguished from the more widely known [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] genre by the use of cross-tunings on the fiddle, by all melody instruments playing in unison, by a lack of individual instruments taking breaks to improvise, by sessions remaining in one tuning or key for an extended period (because fiddles and banjos are tuned especially for that key or even for one tune), and by banjos being [[Clawhammer|frailed]] instead of finger-picked and lacking resonators to make them louder.",
