It is played on [[acoustic instrument]]s, generally centering on a combination of [[fiddle]] (see [[Old time fiddle|old time fiddling]]) and plucked [[string instrument]]s, most often the [[banjo]], [[guitar]], and [[mandolin]]. Together, they form an ensemble called the [[string band]], which along with the simple banjoâ€“fiddle duet have historically been the most common configurations to play old-time music. The genre is considered a precursor to modern [[country music]].",
