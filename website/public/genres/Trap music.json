  "description": "'''Trap music''', also known simply as '''trap''', is a subgenre of [[hip-hop]] music that originated in the [[Southern United States]], with lyrical references to trap starting in 1991 but the modern sound of trap appearing in 1999. The genre gets its name from the [[Atlanta]] slang term \"[[trap house]]\", a house used exclusively to sell drugs. Trap music is known for its simple, rhythmic, minimalistic productions that use synthesized drums, and is characterized by complex [[hi-hat]] [[Drum beat|patterns]], [[snare drum]]s, [[Bass drum|bass drums]], some tuned with a long [[Envelope (music)|decay]] to emit a bass frequency (originally from the [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]]), and lyrical content that often focuses on drug use and urban violence.\n\nPioneers of the genre include producers [[DJ Spanish Fly]], [[DJ Paul]] & [[Juicy J]], [[Kurtis Mantronik]], [[Mannie Fresh]], [[Shawty Redd]], Fatboi, [[Zaytoven]], [[DJ Screw]], and [[DJ Toomp]], along with rappers [[T.I.]], [[Jeezy]], and [[Gucci Mane]]. The style was popularized by [[Record producer|producer]] [[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]], who produced the influential [[Waka Flocka Flame]] album ''[[Flockaveli]]'' in 2010, and cofounded the prolific [[hip-hop production]] team [[808 Mafia]].\n\nSince crossing over into the mainstream in the 2010s, trap has become one of the most popular forms of American music, consistently dominating the [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] throughout the decade, with artists such as [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[21 Savage]], [[Migos]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Post Malone]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[DaBaby]], [[Roddy Ricch]], [[Young Thug]], and [[Travis Scott]] (among many others) all achieving No. 1s on the chart with songs featuring production inspired by the trap subgenre. It has influenced the music of many pop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] artists, such as [[Ariana Grande]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Rihanna]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]] and more. Its influence can also be heard in [[reggaetón]] and [[K-pop]]. In 2018, hip-hop became the most popular form of music for the first time ever (according to [[Nielsen Data]]), coinciding with trap's continued rise in popularity. 2019 saw trap-influenced hits amass high commercial success such as Ariana Grande's \"[[7 Rings]]\" spending eight weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and the country-trap song \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] (featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]), which broke the record for spending the most weeks (19) on top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, as well as becoming the fastest song to reach a [[Music recording certification|Diamond Certification]].",
