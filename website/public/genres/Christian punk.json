  "description": "'''Christian punk''' is a form of [[Christian music]] and a [[music genre|subgenre]] of [[punk rock]] which contain Christian lyrical content. Much disagreement persists about the boundaries of the subgenre, and the extent that their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies among bands. For example, [[the Crucified]] explicitly rejected the classification of \"Christian punk\" while staying within the [[Christian music industry]].\n\nGiven the nature of punk and some of its subgenres, such as [[hardcore punk]], many bands have been rejected by the Christian and [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] industry. Christian punk has been deemed novel in that it \"seeks authenticity in two differently organized and orientated cultures: secular punk on the one hand and Evangelical youth culture and CCM on the other\".\n Some bands generally avoid specific mention of [[God in Christianity|God]] or [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]; likewise some bands may specifically reject the CCM label or express disdain for that niche of the music industry. For example, [[Ninety Pound Wuss]] vocalist [[Jeff Suffering]] said about the breakup of the band in 2000, \"...[N]obody wanted to continue playing in [the] \"Christian\" music industry.\"\n\nIt has been noted that \"measured purely by record sales, Christian punk dwarfs all other religious contributions to the genre\". Certain individual Christian punk bands outsold the entire market for the next-largest religious punk genre, [[Krishnacore]].",
