  "description": "'''Midwestern hip-hop''', also known as '''Midwestern rap''', is a style of hip-hop that originated in the [[Midwest]] region of the [[United States]]. The genre initially gained popularity in the mid-1990s thanks to extremely fast rappers known as \"choppers\", such as [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]] (Cleveland), [[Twista]] and [[Da Brat]] (Chicago), [[Tech N9ne]] (Kansas City), [[Atmosphere (group)|Atmosphere]] (Minneapolis), and [[Eminem]] (Detroit).\n\nHowever, while these artists were the first to introduce Midwest rap which rivaled the popularity of West Coast and East Coast styles, a new wave of groups and artists began to emerge, such as [[Nelly]], [[D12]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]], and [[Kanye West]], although they shared very few similarities with their predecessors. Other notable rappers and producers from the Midwest include [[Brother Ali]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Royce Da 5'9\"]], [[J Dilla]], and [[Elzhi]], [[Kid Cudi]], [[Freddie Gibbs]], and [[Obie Trice]].",
