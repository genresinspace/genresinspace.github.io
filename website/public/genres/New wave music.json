  "description": "'''New wave''' is a [[music genre]] that encompasses [[pop music|<!-- Per AllMusic source on new wave: \"It is a catch-all term, collecting a variety of pop-oriented musics that weren't part of the mainstream, yet were melodic, catchy, idiosyncratic and quirky.\"&nbsp; -->pop]]-oriented styles that emerged in the mid- to late 1970s as a lighter and more melodic \"broadening of [[Punk subculture|punk culture]]\". The term was coined by [[Sire Records]] founder [[Seymour Stein]] as a catch-all for musical styles that emerged after [[punk rock]] and ultimately encompassed many contemporary [[popular music]] styles, including [[synth-pop]], [[alternative dance]] and [[post-punk]].\n\nNew wave commercially peaked during the late 1970s into the early 1980s with an abundance of [[one-hit wonder]]s. In 1981, the [[MTV]] channel was launched, which heavily promoted and popularized new-wave acts in the United States. By the mid- to late 1980s, new wave was overtaken by the [[New Romantic]] movement in the UK, while in the US, it declined in popularity as other music genres gained commercial success. \n\nNew wave-inspired subgenres emerged during the 1980s such as [[Cold wave (music)|coldwave]], [[minimal wave]] and [[Dark wave|darkwave]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, new wave experienced a brief revival, labelled the \"[[new wave of new wave]]\" or \"[[Electroclash|new new wave]]\" by the press. The genre influenced later internet [[Microgenre|microgenres]] such as [[Zolo music|zolo]], [[bloghouse]], [[new rave]], [[chillwave]], [[synthwave]], [[vaporwave]] and [[devocore]].",
