  "description": "'''New wave''' is a [[music genre]] that encompasses [[pop music|<!-- Per AllMusic source on new wave: \"It is a catch-all term, collecting a variety of pop-oriented musics that weren't part of the mainstream, yet were melodic, catchy, idiosyncratic and quirky.\"&nbsp; -->pop]]-oriented styles that emerged in the mid- to late 1970s as a lighter and more melodic \"broadening of [[Punk subculture|punk culture]]\". The term new wave initially held distinct regional differences between the United States and United Kingdom. In the US, \"new wave\" had originally been used by music critics to label [[New York punk]] bands during the early-to mid 1970s. The term was later adopted by [[Sire Records]] founder [[Seymour Stein]], who launched the \"Don't Call It Punk\" campaign in October 1977 to replace \"punk\" with \"new wave\". In the UK, new wave was less rooted in punk and had a more diverse definition. Over time, the genre became a catch-all for several musical styles that emerged after the initial popularity of [[punk rock]], such as [[synth-pop]], [[alternative dance]] and [[post-punk]].\n\nNew wave commercially peaked during the late 1970s into the early 1980s with an abundance of [[one-hit wonder]]s. In 1981, the [[MTV]] channel was launched, which heavily promoted and popularized new-wave acts in the United States. Regional new wave scenes developed across Europe, particularly  the Netherlands' [[Ultra (music)|ultra]], Germany's [[Neue Deutsche Welle]], Spain's [[La Movida Madrileña]], France, Poland and Belgium's [[Cold wave (music)|coldwave]], as well as the [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|Yugoslav new wave]]. Additionally, the movement inspired subgenres such as [[minimal wave]] and [[Dark wave|darkwave]].\n\nBy the mid- to late 1980s, new wave was overtaken in the UK by the [[new pop]] and [[New Romantic]] movement, alongside the [[Second British Invasion]] in the US, where the style later declined in popularity as other music genres gained commercial success. In the 1990s and 2000s, new wave experienced brief revivals, labelled the \"[[new wave of new wave]]\" and \"[[Electroclash|new new wave]]\" by the press. The genre influenced later internet [[microgenre]]s such as [[bloghouse]], [[new rave]], [[chillwave]], [[synthwave]], [[vaporwave]] and [[devocore]].",
