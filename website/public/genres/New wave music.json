  "description": "'''New wave''' is a [[music genre]] that encompasses [[pop music|<!-- Per AllMusic source on new wave: \"It is a catch-all term, collecting a variety of pop-oriented musics that weren't part of the mainstream, yet were melodic, catchy, idiosyncratic and quirky.\"&nbsp; -->pop]]-oriented styles from the 1970s through the 1980s. It is considered a lighter and more melodic \"broadening of [[Punk subculture|punk culture]]\". It was originally used as a catch-all for the various styles of music that emerged after [[punk rock]]. Later, critical consensus favored \"new wave\" as an umbrella term involving many contemporary [[popular music]] styles, including [[synth-pop]], [[alternative dance]] and [[post-punk]]. The main new wave movement coincided with late 1970s punk and continued into the early 1980s.\n\nThe common characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, angular guitar riffs, jerky rhythms, the use of electronics, and a distinctive visual style in fashion. In the early 1980s, virtually every new pop and rock act – and particularly those that employed [[synthesizer]]s – were tagged as \"new wave\" in the United States. Although new wave shares punk's [[do-it-yourself]] philosophy, the musicians were more influenced by the styles of the 1950s along with the lighter strains of 1960s pop and were opposed to the generally abrasive, political bents of punk rock, as well as what was considered to be creatively stagnant \"[[arena rock|corporate rock]]\".\n\nNew wave commercially peaked from the late 1970s into the early 1980s with numerous major musicians and an abundance of [[one-hit wonder]]s. [[MTV]], which was launched in 1981, heavily promoted new-wave acts, boosting the genre's popularity in the United States. In the UK, new wave faded at the beginning of the 1980s with the emergence of the [[New Romantic]] movement. In the US, new wave continued into the mid-1980s but declined with the popularity of the New Romantic, [[new pop]], and new music genres. Since the 1990s, new wave resurged several times with the growing nostalgia for several new-wave-influenced musicians.",
