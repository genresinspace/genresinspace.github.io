  "description": "'''Crunk''' is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] that emerged in the early 1990s and gained mainstream success during the mid 2000s. Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop's more dance and club oriented subgenres. An archetypal crunk track frequently uses a main groove consisting of layered keyboard synths, a [[drum machine]] clapping rhythm, heavy [[bassline]]s, and shouting [[vocals]], often in a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] manner. The term \"crunk\" was also used throughout the 2000s as a [[blanket term]] to denote any style of [[Southern hip hop]], a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream.  The word derives from its [[African-American Vernacular English]] past-[[participle]] form, \"crunk\", of the verb \"to crank\" (as in the phrase \"crank up\"). It refers to being excited or high on drugs.",
