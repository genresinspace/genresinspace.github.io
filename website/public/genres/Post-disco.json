  "description": "'''Post-disco''' is a term and genre to describe an aftermath in popular music history {{Circa}} 1979–1986, imprecisely beginning with the backlash against [[disco music]] in the United States, leading to civil unrest and a riot in [[Chicago]] known as the [[Disco Demolition Night]] on July 12, 1979. During its dying stage, disco displayed an increasingly electronic character that soon served as a stepping stone to new wave, [[old-school hip-hop]], [[Euro disco]], and was succeeded by an underground club music called [[hi-NRG]], which was its direct continuation.\n\nAn underground movement of disco music, which was simultaneously \"stripped-down\" and featured \"radically different sounds,\" took place on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] that \"was neither disco and neither R&B.\"  This scene, known as post-disco,{{refn|group=nb|Various terms to describe the sound of what seemed to be post-disco were introduced, such as, but not limited to, \"dance\", \"club music\", \"R&B\", and \"disco\".

It was developed from the [[rhythm and blues]] sound exemplified by [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], the electronic side of [[disco]], [[dub music]] techniques, and other genres. Post-disco was typified by New York City music groups like [[D Train (music group)|\"D\" Train]] and [[Unlimited Touch]] who followed a more urban approach while others, like [[Material (band)|Material]] and [[ESG (band)|ESG]], followed a more experimental one. Post-disco was, like disco, a [[Gramophone record|singles-driven]] market controlled mostly by independent record companies that generated a [[Crossover (music)|cross-over]] chart success all through the early-to-mid 1980s. Most creative control was in the hands of record producers and club DJs which was a trend that outlived the [[dance-pop]] era.\n\nThe term post-disco is often conflated with individual styles of its era, such as [[Boogie (genre)|boogie]], [[synth-funk]], or [[Electro (music)|electro-funk]]. Other musical styles that emerged in the post-disco era include [[dance-pop]] and [[Italo disco]], and the genre led to the development of the early [[alternative dance]], club-centered [[house music|house]] and [[techno]] music.",
