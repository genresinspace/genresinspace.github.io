Specifically, from [[Alligator Rivers|South Alligator River]] south east towards [[Roper River|Ngukurr]], south to the [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]] and west into the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]]. The [[Yolngu]] peoples of [[Arnhem Land]] created the genre.\n\nIn 1938, Australian [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[A. P. Elkin]] described Wangga, \"[It] starts as a sudden high note, then descends in regular intervals to a low pitch, after which the songman just beats his sticks to the accompaniment of the [[didgeridoo]]. Twenty seconds or more later, the melody is sung as before and so on\" and lyrics tend to be syllables. Typically, the songs and dances express themes related to death and regeneration. The songs are performed publicly. The singers compose from their daily lives or while [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming]] of a ''nyuidj'' (dead spirit).",
