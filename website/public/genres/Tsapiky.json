  "description": "'''Tsapiky''' ({{IPA|mg|t͡sapʲikʲ}}) is a musical genre popular in southwest [[Madagascar]], particularly in the former [[Toliara Province]]. It was created as a fusion between [[Music of South Africa#The_1970s|South African pop]] (originally picked up from [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] radio stations) and native Malagasy tradition in the 1970s. The music is characterized by its jerky rhythms and fast beat. The genre sees popularity in the contexts of sports events, night clubs, balls, celebrations, and funerals. Common instruments in tsapiky include: guitar, [[electric guitars]], bass, drums, [[accordions]], synthesizers, and vocals (usually provided by a choir of women).\n\nAlthough initially consisting of solely acoustic instruments, in the 1980s, tsapiky also integrated electric guitars.",
