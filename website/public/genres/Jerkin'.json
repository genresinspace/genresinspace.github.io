  "description": "'''Jerkin'''' or '''Jerk''' is a [[street dance]] culture and [[hip hop]] subgenre originating in urban California in the late 2000s. It gained mainstream popularity outside of California by [[Inland Empire]]-based groups [[New Boyz]] and [[Audio Push]], and has origins in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. Since breaking into the mainstream in 2009, jerkin' gained fans along the [[West Coast (USA)|West Coast]], [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]], and in Europe, notably France and Germany, although it was heavily derided in the Southern United States.\n\nDuring the early 2020s, the original jerk rap scene inspired a [[microgenre]] simply known as \"[[Jerk (music genre)|jerk]]\", which was spearheaded by New York rapper [[Xaviersobased]] alongside his collective ''1c34'', and Californian producer kashpaint, who reimagined the sound of jerk rap with contemporaneous influences, a style which later saw wider prominence in the [[United Kingdom]].",
