  "description": "'''Jerkin'''' or '''Jerk''' is a [[street dance]] culture and [[hip hop]] subgenre originating in urban California in the late 2000s. It gained mainstream popularity outside of California by [[Inland Empire]]-based groups [[New Boyz]] and [[Audio Push]], and has origins in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]]. Since breaking into the mainstream in 2009, jerkin' gained fans along the [[West Coast (USA)|West Coast]], [[Northeastern United States|East Coast]], and in Europe, notably France and Germany, although it was heavily derided in the Southern United States. \n\nIn the early 2020s, a new style of \"jerk rap\" formed spearheaded by New York rapper [[Xaviersobased]] alongside his collective 1c34, which was later further developed by Californian producer kashpaint as well as artists like [[Yhapojj]], Phreshboyswag and [[Nettspend]]. The scene later developed further in the UK, with rappers YT, Fimiguerrero, [[Lancey Foux]] and [[Fakemink]] drawing influence from the sound.",
