  "description": "'''Philadelphia soul''', sometimes called '''Philly soul''', the '''Philadelphia sound''', '''Phillysound''', or '''The Sound of Philadelphia''' ('''TSOP'''), is a genre of late 1960sâ€“1970s [[soul music]] characterized by [[funk]] influences and lush [[string orchestra|string]] and [[brass instrument|horn]] arrangements. The genre laid the groundwork for the emergence of [[disco]] later in the 1970s by fusing the R&B rhythm sections of the 1960s with the pop vocal tradition, and featuring a more pronounced jazz influence in its melodic structures and arrangements. [[Fred Wesley]], trombonist with [[the J.B.'s]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], described the Philadelphia soul sound as \"putting the bow tie on funk.\""
