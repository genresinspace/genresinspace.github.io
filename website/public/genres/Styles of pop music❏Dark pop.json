  "description": "Dark pop (often typeset with a hyphen) is a subgenre of [[pop music]] that combines elements of [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[Independent music|indie]] with [[pop music]]. It is characterized by its deep melancholic sound and minimalistic electronic production. Often dark pop features heavy synths, distorted guitars, and electronic drums.\n\nThe trend began in the 1980s with [[grunge]], a genre that also dealt with depressing topics about heartbreak, loss and loneliness, similar to topics expressed in dark pop. By the 1990s, dark pop drew from [[Trip hop|trip-hop]], [[gothic rock]], and [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]] traditions, evolving and disengaging into a distinct style that emphasized atmospheric texture and introspective storytelling. However dark pop isn't avant-garde, often having a more mainstream sound. Many artists also started to incorporate dark pop with [[Punk Music|punk]], [[Rap Music|rap]] and [[Electronic music|electronic]] sounds. During the 2010s, these infusions became prominent as it gained mainstream traction by well known artists such as [[Rina Sawayama]] who infused it with electronic [[club music]]. A notable dark pop song, that also incorporated electronic sounds is singer and social media personality [[Bella Poarch]]'s debut single \"[[Build a Bitch]]\".",
