  "description": "'''Nu jazz''' (also spelt '''n√º jazz''' or known as '''jazztronica''', or '''future jazz''') is a genre of [[jazz]] and [[electronic music]]. The music blends [[jazz]] elements with other musical styles, such as [[funk]], [[electronic music]], and [[free improvisation]].\n\nNu jazz typically ventures further into the electronic territory than does its close cousin, [[acid jazz]]. Nu jazz can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. The sound departs further from its blues roots than acid jazz does, and instead explores electronic sounds and ethereal jazz sensualities. \"The star of Nu jazz is the music itself and not the individual dexterity of the musicians,\" writes Sunday People."
