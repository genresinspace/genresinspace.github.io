  "description": "'''Melodic hardcore''' is a broadly defined subgenre of [[hardcore punk]] with a strong emphasis on melody in its guitar work. The style often includes guitar harmonies, riffs using octave chords, as well as [[broken chord]]s. Additionally, lyrics tend towards [[intellectualism]], often being politically conscious or narrative, with [[concept albums]] sometimes being prominent. Bands in the genre also have a tendency to take influence from a range of genres including [[emo]], [[post-punk]], [[screamo]], [[pop-punk]], [[metalcore]], [[post-rock]] and [[gothic rock]].\n\nIn the early and mid–1980s, bands including [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]], [[Descendents]], [[Dag Nasty]], [[Gorilla Biscuits]] and [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]] were amongst the first hardcore bands to put an emphasis on their melodies. In 1988, [[Bad Religion]] incorporated more melodic elements into their music with their third album ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was widely influential, and reshaped the [[skate punk]] genre from its purely hardcore origins into a subgenre of melodic hardcore. During the 1990s, this melodic skate punk style became one of the most prominent styles in punk, with [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and [[Strung Out]] emerging as forefront acts. 1988 also saw the formation of [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]] and [[Turning Point (American band)|Turning Point]] who pioneered an additional style of melodic hardcore, routed in [[youth crew]], [[emo]] and [[tough guy hardcore]]. This style began to gain prominence towards the end of the 1990s with [[In My Eyes (band)|In My Eyes]], [[Bane (band)|Bane]] and [[Reach the Sky]].\n\nDuring the 2000s, the genre became the most prominent style in the hardcore scene, and diversified into a variety of styles including the [[horror punk]] and gothic rock informed style of [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[the Nerve Agents]], the heavy and nihilistic style of [[American Nightmare (band)|American Nightmare]] and [[the Hope Conspiracy]], the more melodic and punk-leaning style of [[Rise Against]] and [[Strike Anywhere]], the [[positive hardcore]] style of [[Have Heart]] and [[Verse (band)|Verse]] and the emotional style of [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]] and [[Touché Amoré]]. Around 2009, the genre became less prominent in the American hardcore scene, but continued in the United Kingdom with [[Dead Swans]] and [[While She Sleeps]], and in the American [[metalcore]] scene with [[Hundredth (band)|Hundredth]], [[The Ghost Inside (band)|the Ghost Inside]] and [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]]. During the 2010s, British and Australian melodic hardcore bands including [[Casey (band)|Casey]] and [[Holding Absence]] pushed the genre closer to post-rock. Since the beginning of the 2020s, the most prominent melodic hardcore bands have been [[One Step Closer (band)|One Step Closer]], [[Anxious (band)|Anxious]] and [[Koyo (band)|Koyo]].",
