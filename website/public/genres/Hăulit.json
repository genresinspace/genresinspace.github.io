  "description": "'''Hăulit''' (Romanian pronunciation [[Help:IPA/Romanian|[hə.uˈlit]]]) is a vocal genre of Romanian folklore, found mainly in [[Oltenia]], in the southern and eastern foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. Various names are found in folk speech, including {{Lang|ro|ăulit}}, {{Lang|ro|aguguit}}, and {{Lang|ro|huhurezat}}.{{Sfn|Georgescu|1966|pp=371–372}}{{Sfn|Firca|2010|pp=260–261}}{{Sfn|Alexandru|1975|p=49|loc=Doina}}\n\nHăulit is characterized by an abrupt switch between the chest voice and [[falsetto]], which relates it to the Alpine [[Yodeling|yodel]] and allows it to be considered its Romanian equivalent. Historically, it served as a means of sound signaling over long distances, primarily in pastoral environments, and was also used to express emotions, such as the joy of the arrival of spring.\n\nAs a rule, hăulit is based on the archaic natural [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] and is performed in a free rhythm (''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]''). In modern tradition, it is found both as a standalone form (especially in children's folklore) and as characteristic vocal insertions in other genres, such as the [[doina]] or folk song.",
