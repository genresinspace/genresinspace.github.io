  "description": "'''Post-punk revival''' (also known as '''indie rock revival''') is a [[Music genre|subgenre]] or movement of [[indie rock]] that emerged in the early 2000s as a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of [[Guitar-rock|guitar rock]] inspired by the original sounds and aesthetics of [[post-punk]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[garage rock]]. It is closely associated with [[new wave revival]] and [[garage rock revival]]. \n\nThe genre has an emphasis on \"rock authenticity\" that was seen as a reaction to the commercialism of [[MTV]]-oriented [[nu metal]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and \"bland\" [[post-Britpop]] groups. The commercial breakthrough of the genre came with the release of [[the Strokes]]' ''[[Is This It]]'' in 2001. The genre reached a zenith in the middle of the decade with the success of [[Bloc Party]], [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[the Killers]]. Over time, later indie and post-punk bands were criticized with the term \"landfill indie\".",
