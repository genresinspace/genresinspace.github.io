  "description": "'''Soca music''', or the \"soul of calypso\", is a genre of music that originated in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in the 1970s. It is considered an offshoot of [[Calypso music|calypso]], with influences from [[Afro–Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Afro-Trinidadian]] and [[Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Indo-Trinidadian]] rhythms. It was created by [[Ras Shorty I]] (or Lord Shorty) in an effort to revive traditional calypso, the popularity of which had been declining amongst younger generations in Trinidad due to the rise in popularity of [[reggae]] from Jamaica and [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] from the United States. From the 1980s onward, soca has developed into a range of new styles.",
