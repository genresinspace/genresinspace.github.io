  "description": "'''Glam metal''' (also known as '''hair metal''' or '''[[pop metal]]''') is a subgenre of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] that features [[pop music|pop]]-influenced [[Hook (music)|hooks]] and guitar [[riff]]s, upbeat [[arena rock|rock anthem]]s, and slow [[Sentimental ballad#Power ballads|power ballads]]. It borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s [[glam rock]].\n\nEarly glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s, as visual elements taken from acts such as [[David Bowie]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], and [[New York Dolls]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[Punk rock#New York City|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements taking place concurrently in New York City) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles [[Sunset Strip]] music scene. Early glam metal bands include [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[Ratt]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Dokken]]. Glam metal achieved significant commercial success from approximately 1982 to 1991, bringing to prominence bands such as [[Poison (band)|Poison]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], and [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]. From a strictly visual perspective, glam metal is defined by flashy and tight-fitting clothing, makeup, and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional \"denim & leather\" aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by [[spandex]], [[lace]], and usually heavy use of bright colours.\n\nGlam metal suffered a decline in popularity in the early-mid 1990s, as the [[grunge]] and [[Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|alternative]] phenomena revolutionized hard rock, and fans' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a rejection of the glam metal visual style. During this period, many of the most successful acts of the genre's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction. Glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the late 1990s, with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, as well as the emergence of new, predominantly European bands, including [[The Darkness (band)|the Darkness]], [[Crashdïet]], [[Reckless Love]], and American bands [[Steel Panther]] and [[Black Veil Brides]]."
