  "description": "'''Nederpop''' ({{IPA|nl|ˈneː.dərˌpɔp|lang|audio=Nl-nederpop.ogg}}) or '''Dutch pop music''' is [[pop music]] made by  [[Netherlands|Dutch]] bands and artists.\n\nThe name is a play on the country's name in Dutch ''(Nederland)''. An English translation could be ''Netherpop''. Nederpop is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] term invented by the mid-1970s to describe the Dutch pop music scene of the 1960s and 1970s that was gaining worldwide attention, exemplified by bands such as [[Shocking Blue]], [[Golden Earring]] and [[Focus (band)|Focus]]. Most of the Nederpop bands of this period had English-language songs or played only instrumentals, but some of the bands performed exclusively in the Dutch language. Many such were popular thanks to airplay over the offshore [[pirate radio]] stations targeting the Netherlands such as Mi Amigo, Veronica, Atlantis and Northsea International.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the Nederpop term was revived to name the sudden growth of Dutch language [[pop music]] from the [[Netherlands]]. The revived meaning came about because of the huge success of [[Doe Maar]]. This success helped other bands to sing in Dutch and/or get the spotlight.",
