It shares the same name as [[Riddim|the Jamaican genre that influenced both it and dubstep]], which originally derived from [[Dub music|dub]], [[reggae]], and [[dancehall]]. Originating in the United Kingdom, specifically [[Croydon]], in the early 2010s as a resurgence of the style used by early dubstep works, riddim started to gain mainstream presence in the electronic music scene around 2015.\n\nDespite receiving criticism for its sometimes repetitive drops, it has grown in popularity due to various well-known electronic music [[Djs|DJs]] playing songs of the subgenre in their live sets as well as various well-known electronic music artists producing the genre.",
