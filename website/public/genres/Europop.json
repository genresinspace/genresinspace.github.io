  "description": "'''Europop''' (also spelled '''Euro pop''') is a style of [[pop music]] that originated in Europe during the mid-to-late 1960s and developed to today's form throughout the late 1970s. Europop topped the charts throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with revivals and moderate degrees of appreciation in the 2000s. It is characterized by catchy beats, slick songs and frothy lyrics. Swedish group [[ABBA]] is often credited for popularizing the genre. Modern Europop overlaps with [[Eurodance]], however the latter is more [[Electronic dance music|club]] and [[hi-NRG]] leaning.",
