  "description": "'''Maloya''' is one of the two major [[music genre]]s of [[Réunion]], usually sung in [[Réunion Creole]], and traditionally accompanied by percussion and a musical bow. Maloya is a new form that has origins in the music of African and Malagasy [[slave]]s and Indian indentured workers on the island, as has the other folk music of Réunion, [[sega (genre)|séga]]. World music journalists and non-specialist scholars sometimes compare maloya to the [[Music of the United States|American music]], the [[blues]], though they have little in common. Maloya was considered such a threat to the French state that it was banned in the 1970s.",
