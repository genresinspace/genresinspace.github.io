  "description": "'''Muziki wa dansi''' (in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]: \"dance music\"), or simply '''dansi''', is a Tanzanian music genre, derivative of [[soukous|Congolese soukous]] and [[Congolese rumba]]. It is sometimes called '''Swahili jazz''' because most dansi lyrics are in Swahili, and \"jazz\" is an umbrella term used in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Eastern Africa]] to refer to soukous, [[highlife]], and other dance music and [[big band]] genres. Muziki wa dansi can also be referred to as '''Tanzanian rumba''', as \"african rumba\" is another name for soukous.\n\nMuziki wa dansi began in the 1930s in the [[Dar es Salaam]] area (where most dansi bands come from), and it is still popular in Tanzania, although new generations are more likely to listen to [[bongo flava]] or other forms of [[pop music]]. Notable dansi bands include [[DDC Mlimani Park]], [[International Orchestra Safari Sound]], [[Juwata Jazz]], [[Maquis Original]], [[Super Matimila]], and [[Vijana Jazz]].",
