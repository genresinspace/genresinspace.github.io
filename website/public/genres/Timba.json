  "description": "'''Timba''' is a [[Music of Cuba|Cuban genre of music]] based on Cuban ''[[Son Cubano|son]]'' with ''[[salsa (music)|salsa]]'', American \nFunk/R&B and the strong influence of Afro-Cuban folkloric music. Timba rhythm sections differ from their salsa counterparts, because timba emphasizes the [[bass drum]], which is not used in salsa bands. Timba and salsa use the same tempo range and they both use the standard conga marcha. Almost all timba bands have a trap drummer. Timbas also often break the basic tenets of arranging the music in-[[clave (rhythm)|clave]]. Timba is considered to be a highly aggressive type of music, with rhythm and \"swing\" taking precedence over melody and lyricism. Associated with timba is a radically sexual and provocative dance style known as despelote (literally meaning chaos or frenzy). It is a dynamic evolution of salsa, full of improvisation and Afro Cuban heritage, based on son, Rumba and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], taking inspiration from Latin jazz, and is highly percussive with complex sections. Timba is more flexible than salsa and includes a more diverse range of styles. Timba incorporates heavy percussion and rhythms which originally came from the [[barrio]]s of Cuba.",
