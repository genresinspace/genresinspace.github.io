  "description": "'''Romantic Modernism''', more commonly known as '''Romo''', was a musical and nightclubbing movement, of [[Glam rock|glam]]/style pop lineage, in the UK circa 1995–1997, centred on the twin homes of [[Camden Town|Camden]]-based clubnight Club Skinny and its [[West End of London|West End]] clone Arcadia, as well as concerts by the chief associated bands.\n\nThe Romo movement was essentially a derivation of late-1970s [[disco]] and early-1980s club music, with an emphasis on the extroverted sartorial style and decadent air of [[New Romantic]]-era bands such as [[Japan (band)|Japan]] and [[Soft Cell]]. Nonetheless, contemporary features in ''Melody Maker'' (where the genre was championed mainly by [[Simon Price]] and [[Taylor Parkes]] – it was dismissed by the rival ''NME'') tended to downplay the nostalgic connection with New Romantic, emphasising Romo's innovation and contemporary relevance.\n\nMuch championed by the said writers at the ''Melody Maker'' as a stylish and poppy backlash against the dressed-down style and raw [[jangly]] sound of the [[Britpop]] movement, while variously fêted and lambasted by others in the media as a [[New Romantic]] revival (a tag rejected by those on the scene), Romo's legacy has been chiefly in club culture as it heralded a new generation of glam/ style-orientated club nights which would continue through the 2000s.",
