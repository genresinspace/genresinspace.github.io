  "description": "'''Gaana''' (or Gānā) is a genre of [[Tamil music]], which is sung in the [[Madras Bashai]] dialect of [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. It is [[Rapping|rap]]-like \"collection of [[rhythm]]s, beats and sensibilities native to the Madras people.\" It evolved over the past two centuries, with influences ranging from the ''siddhars'' (tantric adepts) of ancient [[Tamilakam]] to rural Tamil folk music to Tamil [[Sufism|sufi]] mystics. Its popularity rose when it was brought to the music of the mainstream Tamil film industry. Contemporary gaana bands are bringing the genre to new audiences while using it for social activism, especially against [[Caste system in India|caste discrimination]].",
