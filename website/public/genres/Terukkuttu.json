  "description": "'''Terukkuttu''' is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[street theatre]] form practised in [[Tamil Nadu]] state of [[India]] and Tamil-speaking regions of [[Sri Lanka]]. Terukuttu is a form of [[Koothu]], an entertainment, a ritual, and a medium of social instruction, originated from the early [[Tamilakam]]. The terukkuttu plays various themes.  One theme is from the Tamil language versions of the [[Hindu]] epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', focusing on the character [[Draupadi]]. The terms Terukkuttu and [[Kattaikkuttu]] are often used interchangeably in the modern times; however, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while ''Terukkuttu'' referred to mobile performances in a procession, Kattaikkuttu denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space."
