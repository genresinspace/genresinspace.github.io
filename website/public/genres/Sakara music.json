  "description": "'''Sakara music''' is a form of popular [[Nigeria]]n music based in the traditions of [[Yoruba music]].\nIt mostly in the form of praise songs, that uses only traditional [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] instruments such as the solemn-sounding [[goje]] violin, and the small round [[sakara drum]], which is similar to a tambourine and is beaten with a stick.\nSakara music overlays the nasalized, melismatic vocals of Eastern Africa and Arabic on the traditional percussion instruments.\nThe music is often brooding and philosophical in mood.\n\nOne of the first performers of this type of music in [[Lagos]] was [[Abibu Oluwa]], who started playing in the 1930s. On his death in 1964 his place in the band was taken by Salami Alabi (Lefty) Balogun (October 1913 - 29 December 1981), a [[talking drum]]mer, who released over 35 records.\nOther members of the band included Baba Mukaila, and [[Yusuf Olatunji|Joseph (Yussuf) Olatunju]].\nYusuf Olatunji (alias Baba l’Egba), who died in 1978, did much to popularize the musical genre and released many records on the Phillips Nigeria label. A street in [[Abeokuta]] is named after him.\n\nSakara music had considerable influence on other genres, including [[Jùjú music|Jùjú]] and [[African hip hop#Nigeria|Nigerian Hip Hop]].\n[[Fuji music]] is a mixture of Muslim traditional [[Were music]] with elements drawn from Sakara and [[Apala]] music.",
