  "description": "'''''Candombe''''' is a style of music and dance that originated in [[Uruguay]] among the descendants of liberated [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]]. In 2009, the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) inscribed ''candombe'' in its [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].\n\nTo a lesser extent, ''candombe'' is practiced in [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Brazil]]. In Argentina, it can be found in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]], and [[Corrientes]]. In Paraguay, this tradition continues in Camba Cuá and in [[Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay|Fernando de la Mora]] near [[Asunción]]. In Brazil, ''candombe'' retains its religious character and can be found in the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThis Uruguayan music style is based on three different drums: chico, repique, and piano drums. It is usually played in February during [[Uruguayan Carnival|carnival in Montevideo]] at dance parades called ''llamadas'' and ''desfile inaugural del carnaval''.",
