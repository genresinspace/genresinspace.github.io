  "description": "'''Kwaito''' is a [[music genre]] that emerged in [[Soweto]], [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, between the late 1980s and 1990s. It is a sound that features the use of African sounds and [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. Kwaito songs occur at a slower tempo range than other styles of house music and often contain catchy melodic and percussive loop samples, deep bass lines and vocals. They are also very similar tempos to early 1990s NYC house tracks."
