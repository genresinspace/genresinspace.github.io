  "description": "'''Space age pop''' or '''bachelor pad music''' is a subgenre of [[easy listening]] or [[lounge music|lounge]] music associated with American and Mexican composers, songwriters, and bandleaders in the [[Space Age]] of the 1950s and 1960s. It drew on contemporary fascination with technology, outer space, and \"exotic\" locations, exploiting new audio technology such as [[stereophonic sound]], [[multitrack recording]], and early [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]]. [[Irwin Chusid]] identifies the heyday of the genre as \"roughly 1954 to 1963—from the dawn of [[High fidelity|high-fidelity]] (hi-fi) to the arrival of [[the Beatles]].\" Major artists in the genre include [[Juan García Esquivel]], [[Les Baxter]], [[Enoch Light]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Dick Hyman]], and [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]].\n\nAmong the major influences on space age pop were [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] composers such as [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]], [[big band]] jazz, [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian music]], and contemporary [[Music of Latin America|Latin American styles]] such as [[samba]], [[Mambo (music)|mambo]], and [[Calypso music|calypso]]. There is much overlap between space age pop and contemporary [[exotica]], [[surf music]], [[beautiful music]], and [[easy listening]], and it may be regarded as a precursor to [[space music]] or other forms of [[ambient music]]. Space age pop albums often have titles and covers related to [[science fiction]], featuring rockets, outer space vistas, and [[mid-century modern]] design, or emphasizing its intended audience of affluent, stylish bachelors in [[cocktail]] bars and lounges.\n\nThe genre saw a revival in interest in the 1990s, hand in hand with the contemporary [[swing revival]] and [[Tiki culture#Partial revival|tiki revival]] which drew on related styles and aesthetics. Contemporary bands that took inspiration from the style were mixed in their approach, with some, such as [[Combustible Edison]], seeking to revere and faithfully revive the style, while acts such as [[Mr. Bungle]] and [[Stereolab]] updated it with contemporary influences and offered postmodern commentary on easy listening styles' perceived [[Orientalism]] and celebration of [[conspicuous consumption]].",
