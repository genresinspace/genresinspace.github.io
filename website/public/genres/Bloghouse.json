  "description": "'''Bloghouse''' (also known as '''bloghaus''') is a loosely defined scene and [[microgenre]] of [[house music|house]] and [[electronic dance music]] that rose to prominence during the early 2000s. Initially emerging on the [[Internet]] similarly to other early [[blog]]-related music scenes such as [[blog rock]] and [[blog rap]]. Bloghouse was characterized by its fusion of [[electroclash]], [[house music]], [[New rave|nu rave]], [[electro house]], [[electro dance]], [[electro hop]], [[nu-disco]], [[French touch]], [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[indie rock]] aesthetics. The scene originally emerged from the early online musical [[blogosphere]], with music being distributed through [[MP3 blog]]s, like [[Hype Machine]] and [[Hipster Runoff]], as well as early [[social media]] platforms such as [[Myspace]].\n\nThe bloghouse era went on to become an influence on the [[hyperpop]] movement, as well as an inspiration for the \"[[indie sleaze]]\" aesthetic, which was coined in 2021, to refer to the fashion and visual style of bloghouse-related artists alongside various other 2000s alternative music scenes. Notable acts include [[Justice (band)|Justice]], [[Crystal Castles]], [[Uffie]], [[Mstrkrft]], [[Simian Mobile Disco]], and [[Boys Noize]].",
