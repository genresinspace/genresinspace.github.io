  "description": "'''Drill music''', also known as '''drill rap''' or simply '''drill''', is a subgenre of [[hip-hop]] music with sonic origins in [[trap music]] and lyrical origins in [[gangsta rap]]. It began in [[Chicago]], Illinois in the early 2010s. Drill [[lyricism]] is noted for its ominous, [[confrontation]]al nature, often including references to [[Gang#Violence|gang rivalries]] and various incidents, sometimes [[murder]], although the subgenre is thematically broader. Drill artists often address authentic, real-life conflicts, at times incorporating artistic expressions such as bravado, taunting, or mockery.\n\nEarly drill artists are typically noted for their associations with [[crime in Chicago]], especially with the [[Black Disciples]] and [[Gangster Disciples]]. The genre garnered  mainstream attention in 2012 following the success of pioneering [[Chicago hip-hop|Chicago rappers]] like [[Chief Keef]], [[Lil Durk]], [[Lil Reese]], [[Fredo Santana]], [[G Herbo]], [[Lil Bibby]], [[King Louie (rapper)|King Louie]], [[FBG Duck]], and producer [[Young Chop]].{{efn|Attributed to multiple sources: <ref name=\"v513\">{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Ashley |date=May 31, 2024 |title=How Chief Keef Spearheaded The Drill Movement |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/809538-how-chief-keef-spearheaded-the-drill-movement |access-date=June 25, 2024 |website=HotNewHipHop |archive-date=June 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240625210232/https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/809538-how-chief-keef-spearheaded-the-drill-movement |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Drake-18\">{{cite web |last1=Drake |first1=David |date=February 12, 2018 |title=How Chief Keef became the most influential hip-hop artist of his generation |url=https://theoutline.com/post/3359/chief-keef-influence-essay?zd=1&zi=2sc5oqy7 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510115250/https://theoutline.com/post/3359/chief-keef-influence-essay?zd=1&zi=2sc5oqy7 |archive-date=May 10, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018 |website=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Artist - Chief Keef\">{{cite web |title=Artist – Chief Keef |url=https://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510051121/https://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/ |archive-date=May 10, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018 |website=[[Pitchfork Media]]}}</ref><ref name=\"hypefreshmag.com\">{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Dominique |title=Finally Rich: The Way That Chief Keef Has Influenced A New Generation of Artists |url=https://hypefreshmag.com/music/how-has-chief-keef-been-an-influence-in-rap |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510050729/https://hypefreshmag.com/music/how-has-chief-keef-been-an-influence-in-rap |archive-date=May 10, 2018 |access-date=May 9, 2018 |website=Hypefresh Mag}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{citation |last=Barber |first=Andrew |title=10 years ago, Chief Keef launched drill music into the mainstream |date=June 20, 2022 |magazine=Mic.com |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130123/englewood/chief-keef-record-deal-is-6-million-over-3-years/ |access-date=July 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220818232008/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130123/englewood/chief-keef-record-deal-is-6-million-over-3-years/ |archive-date=August 18, 2022 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-03-02 |title=Lil Bibby and G Herbo, strong and strong together |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-herb-bibby-ott-0303-20170228-story.html |access-date=2023-08-11 |website=Chicago Tribune |archive-date=March 28, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230328172318/https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-herb-bibby-ott-0303-20170228-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>}} Other rappers, such as [[Murder of Joseph J.

The [[UK drill]] scene emerged in the mid-2010s, leading to the prominence of artists such as [[67 (rap group)|67]], [[Harlem Spartans]], [[CGM (rap group)|CGM]], and [[Skengdo x AM]]. UK drill subsequently influenced regional scenes in Europe and America, including [[Brooklyn drill]], which gained mainstream popularity in the early 2020s with artists like [[Pop Smoke]] and [[Fivio Foreign]]. Drill scenes have been noted in such locales as [[Irish rap#Grime/drill|Ireland]], [[Australian hip-hop#Drill music|Australia]], [[Dutch hip-hop|the Netherlands]], [[Gh hip-hop|Ghana]], [[African hip-hop#Uganda|Uganda]], [[European hip-hop#Northern Europe|Denmark]] and [[French hip-hop|France]].\n\nThe subgenre's controversial nature has stimulated discussion. Public debate about the implications drill rap has raged, while some authorities, elected officials, and commentators in the UK and America castigate the genre and its artists, claiming that drill rap catalyzes real world violence. On the other hand, it has been counterargued that drill illuminates harsh societal realities, resonating closely with the disenfranchised youth audience, and that artists are within their [[Freedom of speech|right to self-expression]]. Attempts at curtailing the subgenre, including deleting posted music videos, blockading performances, and legalizing song lyrics as criminal evidence, have been put in practice in the UK and America, generating further controversy.",
