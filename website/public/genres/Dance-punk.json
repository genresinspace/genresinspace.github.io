  "description": "'''Dance-punk''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[post-punk]] that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the [[disco]], [[post-disco]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements. The genre, which began originally as '''disco-punk''' or [[punk funk]], is characterized by the incorporation of the angularity and syncopation of [[funk]] and the upbeat, danceable rhythms of [[disco]] into post-punk, [[art punk]] and more general [[punk rock]]. Its development is closely related to [[avant-funk]], originally known as mutant disco. It was most prominent in punk in [[New York City]], overlapping into the [[no wave]] movement.",
