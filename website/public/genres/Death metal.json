  "description": "'''Death metal''' is an [[extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as [[palm muting]] and [[tremolo picking]]; deep [[death growl|growling]] vocals; aggressive, powerful drumming, featuring [[double kick]] and [[blast beat]] techniques; minor keys or [[atonality]]; abrupt tempo, key, and [[time signature]] changes; and [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may include [[slasher film]]-style violence, [[political conflict]], [[religion]], [[nature]], [[philosophy]], [[true crime]] and [[science fiction]].{{sfn|Purcell|2003|p=39-42}}\n\nBuilding from the musical structure of [[thrash metal]] and [[Black metal#First wave|early black metal]], death metal emerged during the mid-1980s. Bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Slayer]], and [[Kreator]] were important influences on the genre's creation.{{sfn|McIver|2000|p=14}}{{sfn|McIver|2000|p=100}}{{sfn|McIver|2000|p=55}} [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Necrophagia]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]], and [[Morbid Angel]] are often considered pioneers of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as a popular genre. Niche record labels like [[Combat Records|Combat]], [[Earache Records|Earache]], and [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.\n\nSince then, death metal has diversified, spawning several subgenres. [[Melodic death metal]] combines death metal elements with those of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]]. [[Technical death metal]] is a complex style, with uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms, and unusual harmonies and melodies. [[Death-doom]] combines the deep growled vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal with the slow tempos and melancholic atmosphere of [[doom metal]]. [[Deathgrind]], [[goregrind]], and [[pornogrind]] mix the complexity of death metal with the intensity, speed, and brevity of [[grindcore]]. [[Deathcore]] combines death metal with [[metalcore]] traits. [[Death 'n' roll]] combines death metal's [[Death growl|growled vocals]] and highly [[Distortion|distorted]], [[Guitar tunings|detuned]] guitar riffs with elements of 1970s [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].",
