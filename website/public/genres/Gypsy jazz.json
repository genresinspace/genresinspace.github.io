  "description": "'''Gypsy jazz''' (also known as '''sinti jazz''', '''gypsy swing''', '''jazz manouche''' or '''hot club-style jazz''') is a musical idiom inspired by the [[Romani people|Romani]] jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt|Jean \"Django\" Reinhardt]] (1910–1953), in conjunction with the French jazz violinist [[Stéphane Grappelli]] (1908–1997), as expressed by their group the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]]. The style has its origins in France and the [[Manouche]] clan of Romanis, and has remained popular amongst this clan. Gypsy jazz is often called by the French name ''jazz manouche'', or alternatively, ''manouche jazz'' in English-language sources.\n\nReinhardt was foremost among a group of gypsy guitarists working in Paris from the 1930s to the 1950s. The group included the brothers [[Baro Ferret|Baro]], [[Sarane Ferret|Sarane]], and [[Matelo Ferret]] and Reinhardt's brother [[Joseph Reinhardt|Joseph \"Nin-Nin\" Reinhardt]].\n\nThe style was popular in France and, via recordings and appearances by the original ''Quintette'', in other European countries before and immediately after the [[Second World War]]. It fell out of favour as the \"swing era\" came to an end, being replaced in its homeland by [[bebop]], mainstream jazz, and eventually, [[rock and roll]]. However, it had a resurgence from the 1970s onwards, among performers and audiences at festivals, etc., in particular the [[Festival Django Reinhardt]] which commenced in 1968 at [[Samois-sur-Seine]], France (the location of Reinhardt's last residence) and continues to the present time.",
