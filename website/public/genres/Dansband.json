  "description": "'''{{Lang|sv|Dansband}}''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈdânsˌband|x|Sv-dansband.ogg}}; \"dance band\"), or '''{{Lang|no|danseband}}''' in Norwegian and Danish, is a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] term for a band that plays '''{{Lang|sv|dansbandsmusik}}''' ({{IPA|sv|ˈdânsˌbandsmɵˌsiːk|x|Sv-dansbandsmusik.ogg}}; \"dance band music\"). ''{{lang|sv|Dansbandsmusik}}'' is often danced to in [[partner dance|pairs]]. [[Jitterbug]] and [[foxtrot]] music are often included in this category. The music is primarily inspired by [[schlager]], [[country music|country]], [[rock'n'roll]] and some [[swing music|swing]]. The main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe terms ''{{lang|sv|dansband}}'' and ''{{lang|sv|dansbandsmusik}}'' were coined around 1970, when Swedish popular music developed a signature style. The genre developed primarily in Sweden, but has spread to neighbouring countries [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking regions of Finland]]. When the music came to Norway it was first called \"{{lang|no|svensktoppar|italic=no}}\" (from the Swedish radio music chart [[Svensktoppen]], which was a major arena for dansband music before its rules changed in January 2003).\n\nA dansband often [[Tour (music)|travels by bus]], performing several times every week year-round, outdoors in the summertime and indoors in the wintertime. Performances are also often held on cruise ships.\n\nSeveral dansbands are named after their lead singer (whose name is sometimes shortened), followed by \"''{{lang|sv|orkester}}''\" (\"orchestra\"). The tradition originates from the old [[:sv:Dansorkester|dance orchestra]]s, often named after their [[Kapellmeister]]. The possessive suffix \"s\" is often replaced by \"z\" in dansband names. Some dansbands are named after earlier members.\n\nThe main audience for dansband music is middle-aged adults. The music is often performed live by the bands at venues where the main interest of the audience is dancing, rather than watching the performance on stage. However, many dansbands also record albums and singles."
