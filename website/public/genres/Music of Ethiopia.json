  "description": "'''Ethiopian music''' is a term that can mean any music of Ethiopian origin, however, often it is applied to a genre, a distinct [[Musical mode|modal system]] that is [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]], with characteristically long intervals between some notes.\n\nThe music of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] uses a fundamental modal system called ''[[qenet]]'', of which there are four main modes: {{transliteration|am|[[tezeta]]}}, {{transliteration|am|bati}}, {{transliteration|am|[[Ambassel scale|ambassel]]}}, and {{transliteration|am|anchihoy}}. Three additional modes are variations on the above: tezeta minor, bati major, and bati minor. Some songs take the name of their qenet, such as [[tizita]], a song of reminiscence. When played on traditional instruments, these modes are generally not [[Musical temperament|tempered]] (that is, the pitches may deviate slightly from the Western-tempered tuning system), but when played on Western instruments such as pianos and guitars, they are played using the Western-tempered tuning system.\n\nMusic in the Ethiopian highlands is generally [[Monophony|monophonic]] or [[heterophony|heterophonic]]. In certain southern areas, some music is [[Polyphony|polyphonic]]. [[Dorze people|Dorze]] polyphonic singing (''edho'') may employ up to five parts; [[Majangir]], four parts."
