  "description": "'''Neo-bop''' (also called neotraditionalist) refers to a style of [[jazz]] that gained popularity in the 1980s among musicians who found greater aesthetic affinity for acoustically based, swinging, melodic forms of jazz than for [[free jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] that had gained prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-bop is distinct from previous bop music due to the influence of trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]], who popularized the genre as an artistic and academic endeavor opposed to the [[Counterculture|countercultural]] developments of the [[Beat Generation|beat generation]].",
