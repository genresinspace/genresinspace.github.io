  "description": "'''Occult rock''' (also known as '''doom rock''' or '''witch rock''') is a subgenre of [[rock music]] that originated in the late 1960s to early 1970s, pioneered by bands such as [[Coven (band)|Coven]] and [[Black Widow (band)|Black Widow]].\n\nThe genre is influenced by [[hard rock]], [[proto-metal]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]] and [[blues]], as well as commonly incorporating lyrics referencing the [[occult]] with influences from classic [[horror movies]] to books by [[Dennis Wheatley]]. Despite the common perception, it has been noted that occult rock is not inherently gloomy nor dark, although many bands have made music with these qualities.",
