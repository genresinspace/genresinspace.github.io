  "description": "'''Flamenco rock''' or '''Andalusian rock''' is a rock music subgenre that emerged from (but is not limited to) the [[Spain|Spanish]] region of [[Andalusia]] throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. There were some precedents like a couple of albums (''Rock Encounter'' and ''The Soul of Flamenco and the Essence of Rock'') by [[Sabicas]], a handful of singles by [[Smash (Spanish band)|Smash]], Gong, Galaxia, Flamenco or even the American-British band [[Carmen (band)|Carmen]]. However, [[Triana (band)|Triana]] was recognized as a pioneer of the genre since their music focuses on a homogeneous fusion of the progressive rock and flamenco. Many bands that mixed progressive and symphonic rock with flamenco followed them such as Imán Califato independiente, Cai, Guadalquivir, Alameda or [[Mezquita (band)|Mezquita]]; that's why the term ''Andalusian rock'' may be understood simply as ''flamenco prog''.\n\n[[Medina Azahara (band)|Medina Azahara]] turned from progressive to a hard rock outfit in the 1980s and they remain as one of the most popular flamenco rock bands in its home nation. Also other flamenco-influenced styles of rock emerged like the flamenco-folk band Veneno, flamenco-jazz-blues band [[Pata Negra]] among other bands that melted flamenco with African, reggae or Latin rhythms.",
