  "description": "'''Doină cu noduri''' (Romanian for \"doina with knots\", also: {{Langx|ro|hore cu noduri}}, {{Lang|ro|hore în grumaz}}), is an archaic genre of the Romanian vocal tradition, distinguished by an intermittent, \"stuttering\" performance technique. This style creates a tense and expressive effect in which the voice seems to be momentarily caught or paused before re-emerging.\n\nThe genre is a variety of the [[doina]] – an improvisational solo song performed without metrical accompaniment and in a free tempo. Unlike the regular doina, the {{Lang|ro|doina cu noduri}} is characterized by a special technique of vocal ornamentation based on short, sharp sounds that occur at the onset of a note through the accented action of the glottis.\n\nOne of the folk names for this style – {{Lang|ro|hore în grumaz}} (from Romanian for \"throat doina; singing from the [[larynx]]\") – emphasizes that the complex vocal articulation is concentrated directly in the larynx, in contrast to more open, chest-based singing.\n\nSongs of this genre have survived only in northwestern [[Oltenia]], as well as in [[Țara Oașului|Oaș]], [[Maramureș]], and {{Interlanguage link|Țara Lăpușului|lt=Lăpuș|ro|Țara Lăpușului}}, and are considered one of the most archaic forms of the Romanian doina. Today, the genre is on the verge of extinction.\n\nIn 2009, the {{Lang|ro|doina cu noduri}}, along with other types of doina, was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].{{Sfn|unesco.org|2025}}",
