  "description": "'''Pagan rock''' is a genre of rock music created by adherents of [[Modern paganism|neopagan]] traditions. It emerged as a distinct genre from [[gothic rock]] in the 1980s. Bands in this genre will often use pagan and occult imagery and deal with pagan themes. In some cases the definition is stretched to include rock bands embraced by modern Pagans.",
