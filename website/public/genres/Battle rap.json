  "description": "'''Battle rap''' (also known as '''rap battling''') is a type of [[rapping]] performed between two or more performers that incorporates boasts, insults, wordplay and [[Diss (music)|disses]] originating in the [[African Americans|African-American]] community. Battle rap is often performed spontaneously, or [[freestyle rap|freestyled]], in live battles known as rap battles, where participants will compete on the same stage to see who has the better verses.\n\nBattle rap was loosely described by [[40 Cal]], previously a member of American hip hop collective [[the Diplomats]], in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'' (2009) as an \"extracurricular\" display of skill, comparing it to the [[dunk contest]] in the [[NBA]]. Battle rap has been developed into highly organized league events drawing in significant revenue and attention. Mainstream artists such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Eminem]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Joe Budden]] and [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]] have attended or participated in battles to help increase their popularity. Rap battles are often written and performed to impress crowds with technically inventive rapping, and knowing a wide variety of rapping styles and a wide range of [[MCing|MCs]] as personal inspirations is recommended. Various MCs have started out writing mostly battle raps and battling other MCs before releasing commercial records.",
