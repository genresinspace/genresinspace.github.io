It has a slower tempo than standard merengue and its [[Tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]] rhythm is based on the [[cinquillo]].\n\nThis style of merengue was originally known as ''merengue estilo yanqui'' (yankee-style merengue) or \"Palm Beach one step\", from which the term ''pambiche'' stems (corruption of \"Palm Beach\"). It is said to have originated from the americanized versions of merengue that the US military personnel performed during the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24)|occupation of the Dominican Republic]]. It is considered one of the most difficult americanized Latin American dances.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}",
