  "description": "'''Retro soul''', sometimes written as '''retro-soul''', is a contemporary popular music genre that emulates the singing, arrangements and recording techniques of traditional American soul music from the 1950s to the 1970s. This differs from [[neo-soul]] and [[contemporary R&B]] as it intentionally emphasizes a [[Retro style|vintage style]].\n\nThis music was brought to mainstream popularity by singer [[Amy Winehouse]] in 2006. Her [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''[[Back to Black]]'' record production sported a vintage soul style and featured the backing from [[the Dap-Kings]]. Subsequent releases by artists [[Sharon Jones]], [[Meyer Hawthorne|Mayer Hawthorne]], [[Adrian Younge]], [[Raphael Saadiq]], [[Lee Fields]], [[Shoshana Bean]] and [[Charles Bradley (singer)|Charles Bradley]] continued in this tradition.",
