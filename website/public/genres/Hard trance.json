  "description": "'''Hard trance''' is a subgenre of [[trance music]] that originated in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands in the early 1990s as the [[Breakbeat hardcore]] production community began to diversify into new and different styles of electronic music, all influenced by [[hard house]], [[new beat]], [[happy hardcore]] and [[jungle music]]. The popularity of hard trance peaked during the late 1990s and has since faded in favor of newer forms of trance.\n\nHard trance is often characterized by strong, hard (or even downpitch) kicks, fully resonant basses and an increased amount of reverberation applied to the main beat. Melodies vary from 140 to 180 BPM and it can feature plain instrumental sound in early compositions, with the latter ones tending to implement side-chaining techniques from [[progressive trance]] on digital synthesizers.\n\nHard trance was the final form of progressive trance to hit the mainstream. It eventually morphed into [[hardstyle]], [[jumpstyle]] and [[mainstream hardcore|gabber]]. Its mainstream popularity decreased in the mid-2000s.{{Clarify|date=May 2016}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}",
