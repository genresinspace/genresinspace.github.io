  "description": "'''Sertanejo music''' (pronounced seʁtaˈneʒu in [[Brazilian Portuguese|Brazilian portuguese]], or seɹtaˈneʒɵ in [[Caipira dialect]]), is a term used to refer to a musical style of [[Brazil]]. For some, it is the [[folk music]] of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], which emerged during the [[Colonial Brazil|Brazilian colonial period]], and popularized in the [[1920s]], while others argue that it is a variation or urbanization of [[Caipira music]], which is integrated into [[Caipira culture]].\n\nSertanejo is the most popular genre in the country, particularly throughout [[South Region, Brazil|Southern]], [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern]], and [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-western]]. Since the 1990s, is the most played music genre on Brazilian radio, constantly topping the Brazilian music charts. Additionally, from 2000 to 2003 and since 2009, sertaneja music albums have been granted a specific category at the [[Latin Grammy Awards]]. Many sertanejo artists are duos, at times formed by siblings, typically singing vocal harmonies, especially [[major third]]s, and employing frequent [[vibrato]]. Men have traditionally dominated the scene, although some women such as [[Paula Fernandes]], and [[Maria Cecília & Rodolfo|Maria Cecília]], and [[Simone & Simaria]] have achieved mainstream success in the 21st century. A subgenre, called \"[[#Sertanejo universitário|sertanejo universitário]]\" (college sertanejo), has developed from the mid-2000s on, consisting of a more stripped-down, acoustic-oriented use of the guitars influenced by Western pop music. It has grown very popular among Brazilian youth nationwide and has dominated the sertanejo scene.",
