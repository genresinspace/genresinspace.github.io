  "description": "'''Chillstep''' is a subgenre of [[dubstep]] with a softer, melodic, and atmospheric sound to the heavy bass and rhythms of traditional dubstep. It combines elements of [[ambient music]], [[chill-out music|chillout]], and [[Downtempo music|downtempo]] electronic styles, mostly featuring ethereal vocals, warm pads, and relaxed tempos, typically around 120â€“140 beats per minute. Chillstep emerged in the late 2000s, primarily in the United Kingdom, as producers sought to create a more soothing, alternative to the aggressive, heavy sound of mainstream dubstep.",
