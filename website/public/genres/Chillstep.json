  "description": "'''Chillstep''' is a subgenre of [[dubstep]] with a softer, melodic, and atmospheric sound, combined with the heavy bass and rhythms of traditional dubstep. It combines elements of [[ambient music]], [[Chill-out music|chillout]], and [[Downtempo music|downtempo]] electronic styles, mostly featuring ethereal vocals and relaxed tempos, typically around 120–140 beats per minute. Chillstep emerged in the late 2000s, primarily in the United Kingdom, as producers sought to create a more soothing alternative to the aggressive, heavy sound of mainstream dubstep.",
