  "description": "'''Christian hardcore''' or '''Christcore''' is a subcategory of [[hardcore punk]] and [[metalcore]] bands which promote [[Christianity|Christian]] belief. The method and extent of doing so varies between bands. Christian hardcore bands have often openly stated their beliefs and employ Christian imagery in their lyrics, and may be considered a part of the [[Christian music industry]].{{cn|date=February 2024}}\n\nChristian hardcore can serve as an unconventional form of religious community for young people who reject mainstream Christian congregations.\n\nFans of Christian hardcore music are not exclusively believers in the Christian religion. Owing to innovation in the hardcore movement such as [[Extol]], [[Nobody Special]], [[Zao (American band)|Zao]], [[Living Sacrifice]], and the hardcore movement in general, the audience has become less exclusive.",
