However, it gained broader popularity in its neighboring country, the [[Netherlands]] during the 2000s.\n\nJumpstyling is often referred to as \"Jumpen\": a combination of the English word 'Jump' and the Dutch and German suffix '-en' (meaning \"to jump\", or \"jumping\").\n\nThe dance is characterized by high [[Jumping|jumps]] along with fast [[Kick|kicks]] and/or rotations.

A dance that involves two dancers is often referred to as a \"duojump\". \n\nDancers are often referred to as \"jumpers\", or a combination of their name and the word \"jumpen\" or \"jumper\", for example, Patrick Jumpen.",
