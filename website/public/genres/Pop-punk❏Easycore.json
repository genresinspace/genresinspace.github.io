  "description": "'''Easycore''' (less commonly known as '''popcore''', '''dudecore''', '''softcore''', '''happy hardcore''', and '''EZ''') is a genre that merges pop-punk with elements of [[metalcore]].\nIt often makes use of [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdowns]], [[screaming (music)|screamed vocals]], [[major key]] progressions and riffs and [[synthesizers]]. The genre's roots come from early 2000s pop-punk groups [[Sum 41]] and [[New Found Glory]]. New Found Glory's [[New Found Glory (album)|self-titled]] and [[Sticks and Stones (New Found Glory album)|''Stick and Stones'']] albums and Sum 41's song \"[[Fat Lip]]\" were some of the earliest and most influential released in the genre. The style's name originates from the 2008 \"Easycore tour\", which featured [[A Day to Remember]], [[Four Year Strong]] and headliners New Found Glory, which itself was a pun based on the name of \"hardcore punk\".",
