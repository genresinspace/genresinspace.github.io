  "description": "'''Acid''' is an umbrella term for styles of [[electronic music]]—such as [[acid house]], [[acid trance]], [[acid techno]], and [[acid breaks]]—which employ the \"squelching\" sounds of the [[Roland TB-303]] synthesizer. The acid sound became popular in the mid-1980s in connection with the [[Chicago house]] scene, including artists such as [[Phuture]] and labels like [[Trax Records]].\n\nThe term ''acid'' specifically refers to the harsh squelching sound of the Roland 303. The acid sound is achieved by turning up the filter [[resonance]] and turning down the [[cutoff frequency]] parameters of the synthesizer, along with programming the 303's accent, slide, and octave parameters. The term acid has also been suggested to refer to the [[psychedelic]] qualities of the music, which may resemble elements of 1960s [[acid rock]].",
