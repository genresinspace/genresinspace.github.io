The term was featured in writer [[David Keenan]]'s 2009 article ''Childhood's End'' in issue 306 of the British music magazine [[The Wire (magazine)|''The Wire'']] where he coined the term hypnagogic pop, describing it as a \"questing post-Noise network that worships New Age music and uses half-remembered hits as portals to the subconscious\". Music critic [[Simon Reynolds]] referred to \"[[glo-fi]]\"  as a post-noise microscene.   \n\nThe style mostly propagated on the [[Internet]], primarily through [[tape trading]]. Artists such as [[James Ferraro]] and Spencer Clark of [[The Skaters (band)|the Skaters]], [[Oneohtrix Point Never]], [[Pocahaunted]], [[Zola Jesus]], and [[Emeralds (band)|Emeralds]] have been described as post-noise. Ferraro released work through [[CD-R]] and [[cassette tape|cassette]] on self-owned [[Independent record label|independent record labels]] such as New Age Tapes. Several writers have used the terms \"post-noise psychedelia\", \"post-noise underground\" and \"post-noise pop\". Musical styles such as [[neo-kosmische]] and [[vaporwave]] have been associated with the 2000s post-noise trend.   \n\n{{Psychedelic sidebar}}",
