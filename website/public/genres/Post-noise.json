  "description": "'''Post-noise''' (also known as '''post-noise psychedelia''') is a [[microgenre]] and underground music scene that emerged in the early 2000s, and closely associated with the contemporary American [[New-age music|new age]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[hypnagogic pop]] scenes. Artists such as [[James Ferraro]] and Spencer Clark's [[The Skaters (band)|the Skaters]],  [[Oneohtrix Point Never]], [[Pocahaunted]], [[Zola Jesus]] and [[Emeralds (band)|Emeralds]] would pioneer the movement.  \n\nThe American post-noise underground became one of the earliest music scenes to propagate on the [[Internet]], primarily through [[cassette tape]] and [[CD-R]] sharing on the website [[blogspot]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2011a|p=416}} The movement led to the emergence of several online microgenres such as hypnagogic pop, [[eccojams]], [[chillwave]] and [[vaporwave]]. Additionally, the terms \"post-noise\" and \"hypnagogic pop\" would briefly be used interchangeably.",
