  "description": "'''Sovietwave''' (also styled '''Soviet wave''' or '''Soviet-wave''') is a subgenre of [[synthwave]] music and accompanying Internet aesthetic which originates from [[post-Soviet states|the former Soviet Union]], primarily [[Russia]]. It is characterized by an emphasis on the technology and culture of the [[Soviet Union]], such as the [[Soviet space program]] and [[retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] Soviet era architecture and art, and is an expression of [[nostalgia for the Soviet Union]]. Linguist Maria Engstr√∂m described Sovietwave as the post-Soviet counterpart to [[vaporwave]], evoking a similar nostalgic critique of the \"[[Hauntology|contemporary collapse of futurity]]\" and longing for the lost optimism of a bygone era."
