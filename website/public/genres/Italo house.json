  "description": "'''Italo house''' (often simply referred to as \"Italian\" or \"Italian house\" in the UK) is a form of [[house music]] originating in [[Italy]]. Typically popular in Italy, [[UK|Britain]], and [[United States]] since the late 1980s, it fuses [[house music]] and [[Italo disco]]. The genre's main musical characteristic is its use of predominantly [[electronic piano]] chords in a more lyrical form than classic [[Chicago house]] records. The best known example is [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]]'s \"[[Ride on Time]]\", but the genre became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the uplifting and anthemic tunes against the background of indie-dance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}",
