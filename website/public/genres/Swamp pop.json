  "description": "'''Swamp pop''' is a music genre indigenous to the [[Acadiana]] region of south [[Louisiana]] and an adjoining section of [[southeast Texas]]. Created in the 1950s by young [[Cajun]]s and Creoles, it combines [[New Orleans]]â€“style [[rhythm and blues]], [[Country music|country and western]], and traditional [[French Louisiana]] musical influences. Although a fairly obscure genre, swamp pop maintains a large audience in its south Louisiana and southeast Texas homeland, and it has acquired a small but passionate cult following in the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Northern Europe]].",
