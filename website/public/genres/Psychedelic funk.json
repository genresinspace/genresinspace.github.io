  "description": "'''Psychedelic funk''' (also called '''P-funk''' or '''funkadelia''', and sometimes conflated with [[psychedelic soul]]) is a music genre that combines [[funk music]] with elements of [[psychedelic rock]]. It was pioneered in the late 1960s and early 1970s by American acts like [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and the [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective. It would influence subsequent styles including 1970s [[jazz fusion]] and the 1990s [[West Coast hip hop]] style [[G-funk]]."
