  "description": "'''Thai pop''' or '''T-pop''', is a genre of [[Music of Thailand|Thai music]] roughly equivalent to [[pop music]]. It emerged in the 1970s–1980s, during which it was known as '''string music''', before gaining mainstream popularity during the 1990s and has since dominated the Thai music industry. The term is extremely broad, covering [[Thai rock]], [[dance music]], [[hip hop music]] and western-influenced popular music in general, though normally excluding the folk and rock-influenced [[phleng phuea chiwit]] (songs for life).\n\nThe origins of string lie in American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[surf music|surf-rock]] artists like [[The Ventures]] and [[Dick Dale]], [[Exotica]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music|country and western]] brought to Thailand by American and Australian soldiers serving in [[Vietnam]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It also drew heavily on genres from the [[British Invasion]], including [[rock and roll]], [[garage rock]] and Hollywood film soundtracks. Since the 1990s, it has mixed with other genres, such as [[disco]], [[funk]] and [[dance music|dance]].",
