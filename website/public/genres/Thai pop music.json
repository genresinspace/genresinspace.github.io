  "description": "'''Thai pop''' or '''T-pop''', is a genre of [[Music of Thailand|Thai music]] roughly equivalent to [[pop music]]. It emerged in the 1970sâ€“1980s, during which it was known as '''string music''', before gaining mainstream popularity during the 1990s and has since dominated the Thai music industry. The term is extremely broad, covering [[Thai rock]], [[dance music]], [[hip hop music]] and western-influenced popular music in general, though normally excluding the folk and rock-influenced [[phleng phuea chiwit]].\n\nThe origins of string lie in American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[surf music|surf-rock]] artists like [[The Ventures]] and [[Dick Dale]], [[Exotica]], [[rockabilly]] and [[country music|country and western]] brought to Thailand by American and Australian soldiers serving in [[Vietnam]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It also drew heavily on genres from the [[British Invasion]], including [[rock and roll]], [[garage rock]] and Hollywood film soundtracks. Since the 1980s, it has mixed with other genres, such as [[disco]], [[funk]] and [[dance music|dance]].",
