  "description": "{{nihongo|'''''Kayōkyoku'''''|[[:wikt:歌|歌]][[:wikt:謡|謡]][[:wikt:曲|曲]]|4={{Lit.|Pop Tune}}}} is a Japanese [[pop music]] genre, which became a base of modern [[J-pop]]. ''[[The Japan Times]]'' described ''kayōkyoku'' as \"standard Japanese pop\" or \"[[Shōwa period|Shōwa-era]] pop\".\n\n''Kayōkyoku'' represents a blend of Western and [[Japanese musical scales]]. Music in this genre is extremely varied as a result. ''Kayōkyoku'' in the narrower and more practical sense, however, excludes [[J-pop]] and ''[[enka]]''.\n\nUnlike \"J-pop\" singers such as [[Southern All Stars]]' [[Keisuke Kuwata]], the singers of the ''kayōkyoku'' genre do not use stylized pronunciations based on the English language, but prefer traditional Japanese. There are exceptions, such as in singer [[Momoe Yamaguchi]]'s song \"Rock 'n' Roll Widow\".\n\nUnlike ''[[enka]]'', ''kayōkyoku'' is also not based on emotional displays of effort while singing.\n\nFamous ''kayōkyoku'' artists include [[Hiroko Yakushimaru]], [[Kyu Sakamoto]], [[the Peanuts]], [[The Tigers (Japanese band)|the Tigers]], [[Candies (group)|Candies]], [[Pink Lady (duo)|Pink Lady]], [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Junko Sakurada]], [[The Checkers (Japanese band)|the Checkers]] and [[Onyanko Club]]."
