  "description": "'''Doo-wop''' (also spelled '''doowop''' and '''doo wop''') is a [[Music genre#definitions|subgenre]] of [[rhythm and blues]] music that originated in [[African-American]] communities during the 1940s, mainly in the large cities of the United States, including New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. It features vocal group [[harmony]] that carries an engaging melodic line to a simple beat with little or [[a cappella|no instrumentation]]. Lyrics are simple, usually about love, sung by a lead vocal over background vocals, and often featuring, in the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], a melodramatically heartfelt [[recitative]] addressed to the beloved. Harmonic singing of nonsense syllables (such as \"doo-wop\") is a common characteristic of these songs. Gaining popularity in the 1950s, doo-wop was commercially viable until the early 1960s and continued to influence performers in other genres."
