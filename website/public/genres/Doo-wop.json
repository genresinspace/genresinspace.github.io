  "description": "'''Doo-wop''' (also spelled '''doowop''' and '''doo wop''') is a [[Music genre#definitions|subgenre]] of [[Rhythm and blues]] music that originated in [[African-American]] communities during the 1940s, mainly in the large cities of the [[United States]], including New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Detroit, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. It features vocal group [[harmony]] that carries an engaging melodic line to a simple beat with little or [[a cappella|no instrumentation]]. Lyrics are simple, usually about love, sung by a lead vocal over background vocals, and often featuring, in the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], a melodramatically heartfelt [[recitative]] addressed to the beloved. Harmonic singing of nonsense syllables (such as \"doo-wop\") is a common characteristic of these songs. Gaining popularity in the 1950s, doo-wop was commercially viable until the early 1960s and continued to influence performers in other genres.",
