  "description": "'''Psychedelic pop''' (or '''acid pop''') is a genre of [[pop music]] that contains musical characteristics associated with [[psychedelic music]]. Developing in the mid-to-late 1960s, elements included \"[[acid trip|trippy]]\" features such as [[fuzz guitar]]s, tape manipulation, backwards recording, [[sitar]]s, and [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]-style harmonies, wedded to melodic songs with tight song structures. The style lasted into the early 1970s. It has seen revivals in subsequent decades by [[neo-psychedelic]] artists.",
