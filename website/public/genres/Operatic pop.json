  "description": "'''Operatic pop''', '''pop-opera''' or '''popera''' is a subgenre of [[pop music]] that is performed in an [[opera]]tic singing style or a song, theme or motif from [[classical music]] stylized as pop. The subgenre is often performed by [[Crossover music#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singers and acts, although that field is much broader in the types of music it encompasses. \"Popera\" performances, such as those by the [[Three Tenors]], have reached larger audiences and brought in greater profits than typical for operatic music."
