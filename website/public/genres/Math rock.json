  "description": "'''Math rock''' is a style of [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[indie rock]] with roots in bands such as [[King Crimson]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. It is characterized by complex, atypical [[rhythm]]ic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), [[counterpoint]], odd [[time signatures]], and [[extended chord]]s. Bearing similarities to [[post-rock]], math rock has been described as the \"opposite side of the same coin\". Opting for a \"[[rock music|rockier]]\" approach to songwriting and [[timbres]], the style is often performed by [[music ensemble|smaller ensembles]] which emphasize the role of the [[guitar]].\n\n[[Polvo]], [[Don Caballero]], [[Slint]], [[Bitch Magnet]], [[Bastro]] and [[Ruins (Japanese band)|Ruins]] are considered by some to be the genre's pioneers."
