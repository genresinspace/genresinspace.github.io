  "description": "'''Harsh noise wall''', also known as '''wall noise, noise wall,''' or '''HNW''', is an extreme subgenre of [[noise music]], described by music journalist Russell Williams as \"a literal consistent, unflinching and enveloping wall of monolithic noise\".\n\nHarsh noise wall features noises layered together to form a static sound. Harsh noise wall musician Sam McKinlay, also known as The Rita, considered the genre as \"the purification of the [[Japanoise|Japanese harsh noise]] scene into a more refined crunch, which crystallizes the tonal qualities of [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] in a slow moving minimalistic texture.\"\n\nDespite largely staying underground, harsh noise wall has enjoyed a cult following among the noise music scene.",
