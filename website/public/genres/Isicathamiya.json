  "description": "'''Isicathamiya''' ({{IPA|zu|isikǀatʰamija}}, where the ''c'' represents a [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] [[tenuis dental click|dental click]]) is a singing style that originated from the [[Zulu people]], a South African ethnic group. In European understanding, [[a cappella]] is also used to describe this form of singing.\n\nThe word itself does not have a literal translation; it is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] verb {{lang|zu|-cathama}}, which means 'walking softly', or 'tread carefully'. Isicathamiya contrasts with an earlier name for Zulu a cappella singing, [[Mbube (genre)|mbube]], meaning 'lion'. The change in name marks a transition in the style of the music: traditionally, music described as mbube is sung loudly and powerfully, while isicathamiya focuses more on achieving a harmonious blend between the voices. The name also refers to the style's tightly choreographed dance moves that keep the singers on their toes.\n\nSouth African singing groups such as [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] demonstrate this style. Isicathamiya choirs are traditionally all male. Its roots reach back before the turn of the 20th century, when numerous men left the homelands to search for work in the cities. As many of the tribesmen became urbanized, the style was forgotten through much of the 20th century.\n\nToday, isicathamiya competitions in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]] take place on Saturday nights, with up to 30 choirs performing from 8 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock the following morning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}",
