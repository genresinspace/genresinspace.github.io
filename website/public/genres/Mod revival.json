It gained momentum as an underground movement which was highlighted on London Weekend Show 20 May 1979, prior to the impending release of the film ''Quadrophenia''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}\n\nThe late 1970s mod revival was led by the band [[The Jam]], who adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk with the sound of early 1960s mod influenced bands. It was heavily influenced by the 1979 film ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]''. The mod revival was a conscious effort to hark back to the earlier generation in terms of style and presentation. In the early 1980s in the UK, a mod revival scene influenced by the original mod subculture of the 1960s developed.",
