  "description": "The '''mod revival''' is a [[subculture]] that started emulating the aesthetic of the sixties [[Mod (subculture)|Mod culture]] in the late 1970s. Beginning in the United Kingdom, it later spread to other countries. The movement started as a reaction to the disillusionment within the punk scene at the commercialism that had started to set in. First gaining momentum as an underground movement, it took off following the release of [[The Who]] film ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.\n\nThe late 1970s mod revival was led by bands such as [[The Jam]], which adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk with the sound of early 1960s. The mod revival was seen as a conscious effort to hark back to an earlier generation in terms of Mod style and presentation such as wearing 1950s-style [[US Army]] field-[[Parka#Fishtail parka|parka]]s and riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|Italian scooter]]s.",
