  "description": "'''Township music''' (also '''township jazz''') is any of various [[music genre]]s created by black people living in poor, [[racially segregated]] urban areas of [[South Africa]] (\"[[Township (South Africa)|townships]]\") during the 20th century.\n\nThe principal genres of township music are [[mbaqanga]], [[kwela]], and [[marabi]]. Marabi evolved from [[jazz]] influence in the 1920s. Immigrants from [[Malawi]] developed the [[kwela]] sound by fusing Malawian music with marabi. [[Mbaqanga]] music is marabi's successor. It, too, is jazz-like; its roots are in marabi, American jazz, and traditional [[Zulu music]].",
