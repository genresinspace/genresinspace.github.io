  "description": "'''Deathrock''' (or '''death rock''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]]  that merges [[punk rock]] with [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and [[glam rock]] visuals, alongside elements of [[horror film score]]s. Often overlapping with, and sometimes considered a subgenre of, [[gothic rock]], the genre was pioneered by bands from the early 1980s [[Los Angeles]] punk scene, including [[Christian Death]], [[Kommunity FK]], [[45 Grave]] and the [[Super Heroines]]. \n\nBy the middle of the decade, the genre had begun to interact with the United Kingdom's gothic rock scene, leading to the formation of English deathrock bands like [[Sex Gang Children]] and [[Alien Sex Fiend]] though the scene quickly declined and its name largely fell out of use. By the late 1990s, a revival of the genre began with groups like [[Bloody Dead and Sexy]], [[the Phantom Limbs]] and [[Tragic Black]] expanding the scope of the genre to include elements of [[psychobilly]], [[electronic body music]] and [[futurepop]].",
