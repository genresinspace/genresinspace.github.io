  "description": "'''Deathrock''' (or '''death rock''') is a [[rock music]] subgenre that merges [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]] with [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] and [[glam rock]] visuals and elements of [[horror film score]]s. Often overlapping with, and sometimes considered a subgenre of, [[gothic rock]], the genre was pioneered by bands from the early 1980s [[Los Angeles]] punk scene, including [[Christian Death]], [[Kommunity FK]], [[45 Grave]] and the [[Super Heroines]]. By the middle of the decade, the genre had begun to interact with the United Kingdom's gothic rock scene, leading to the formation of English deathrock bands like [[Sex Gang Children]] and [[Alien Sex Fiend]]. However, soon after the genre declined in popularity, and its name largely fell out of use. In the late 1990s, a revival of the genre began, in which groups like [[Bloody Dead and Sexy]], [[the Phantom Limbs]] and [[Tragic Black]] expanded the scope of the genre to include elements of [[psychobilly]], [[electronic body music]] and [[futurepop]].",
