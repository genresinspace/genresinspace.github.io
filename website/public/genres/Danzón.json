  "description": "'''Danzón''' is the official genre and dance of [[Cuba]]. It is also an active musical form in [[USA]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. \nWritten in [[Duple time|{{music|time|2|4}} time]], the danzón is a slow, formal [[partner dance]], requiring [[Sequence dance|set footwork]] around [[syncopated]] beats, and incorporating elegant pauses while the couples stand listening to virtuoso instrumental passages, as characteristically played by a [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] or [[Orquesta típica|típica]] ensemble.\n\nThe danzón evolved from the Cuban [[Habanera (music)|contradanza]], or habanera ({{literal translation|lk=yes}} '[[Havana]]-dance'). The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the [[country dance]] and [[Quadrille|contredanse]], was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants. It may also have been partially seeded during the short-lived [[History of Havana#British occupation|British occupation]] of Havana in 1762. [[Haitian people|Haitian]] refugees fleeing the island's [[Haitian Revolution|revolution of 1791–1804]] brought the French-Haitian [[kontradans]], contributing [[Charanga (Cuba)#Origins|their own]] Creole syncopation. In Cuba, the dances of European origin acquired new stylistic features derived from [[African rhythm]] and [[African dance|dance]] to produce a genuine fusion of European and African influences. [[African music]]al traits in the danzón include complex instrumental [[cross-rhythm]]s, expressed in staggered [[cinquillo]] and [[Tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]] patterns.\n\nBy 1879, the year [[Miguel Failde]]'s ''Las alturas de Simpson'' was first performed (in [[Matanzas]]), danzón had emerged as a distinct genre. Danzón went on to interact with 20th century Cuban genres such as [[Son (music)|son]], and through the [[danzón-mambo]] it was instrumental in the development of [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]].",
