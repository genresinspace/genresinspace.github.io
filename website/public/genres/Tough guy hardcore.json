  "description": "'''Tough guy hardcore''' (also known as '''New York-style hardcore''' or '''new school hardcore''') is a subgenre of [[hardcore punk]] with prominent influences from [[thrash metal]]. It makes use of groove-driven, [[palm mute]]d guitar riffs, [[breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdowns]], lyrics discussing hatred, personal struggles, unity, and a vocal style influenced by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[oi!]].\n\nIn the early to midâ€“1980s [[New York hardcore]] scene, bands including [[Agnostic Front]] and the [[Cro-Mags]] began cultivating a tough, street-wise and groove-driven take on hardcore punk which embraced elements of [[heavy metal music]], particularly its palm muted guitar riffs. By the late 1980s, this developed into the first wave of tough guy hardcore bands: [[Breakdown (band)|Breakdown]], [[Killing Time (American band)|Killing Time]], [[Judge (band)|Judge]] and [[Sick of It All]]. During the 1990s, the genre continued with [[Madball]] and [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] being forefront bands in New York, while [[Blood for Blood]], [[Strife (band)|Strife]], [[Hoods (band)|Hoods]] and [[NJ Bloodline]] expanded the sound across the United States. The genre received a revived interest in the 2000s through acts including [[No Warning (band)|No Warning]], [[Death Before Dishonor (band)|Death Before Dishonor]] and [[Terror (band)|Terror]], and into the 2010s and 2020s with [[Trapped Under Ice]], [[Backtrack (band)|Backtrack]], [[Speed (Australian band)|Speed]] and [[Pain of Truth]].",
