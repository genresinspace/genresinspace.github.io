  "description": "'''Nu skool breaks''' or '''nu breaks''' is a subgenre of [[breakbeat]] originating during the period between 1998 and 2002. The style is usually characterized by more abstract, more technical sounds, sometimes incorporated from other genres of [[electronic dance music]], including [[UK garage]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[drum and bass]]. Typically, tracks ranged between 125 and 140 [[beats per minute]] (bpm), often featuring a dominant bass line. In contrast with [[big beat]], another subgenre of [[breakbeat]], the sound set consisted less of [[hip hop]] [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[Acid house|acid]]-type sounds, instead emphasizing dance-friendliness and \"new\" sounds produced by modern production techniques using [[synthesizer]]s, [[Effects unit|effect processors]], and [[Digital audio workstation|computers]].",
