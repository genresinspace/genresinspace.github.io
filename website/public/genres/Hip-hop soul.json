  "description": "'''Hip-hop soul''' is a [[musical genre|subgenre]] of [[contemporary R&B]] music, most popular during the early and mid 1990s, which fuses R&B or [[soul music|soul]] singing with [[hip-hop]] musical production.  The subgenre had evolved from a previous R&B subgenre, [[new jack swing]], which had incorporated hip-hop influences into R&B music. By contrast, hip-hop soul is, as described in ''The Encyclopedia of African American Music'', \"quite literally soul singing over hip-hop grooves\".\n\nThe genre was most popular during the mid and late 1990s with artists such as [[Mary J. Blige]] (known as the \"Queen of Hip-Hop Soul\"), [[Jodeci]], [[Faith Evans]], [[TLC (group)|TLC]], and [[R. Kelly]]. By the late 1990s, hip-hop soul would lead to the creation of [[neo soul]], which retained the hip-hop and R&B influences while also adding elements of classic 1970s [[soul music]].",
