  "description": "'''Nortec''' (from the combination of \"[[Norteño (music)|norteño]]\" and \"[[techno]]\") is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] developed in [[Tijuana]] (a border city in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]) that first gained popularity in 2001. Nortec music is characterized by hard dance beats and samples from traditional forms of Mexican music such as ''[[Banda music|Banda sinaloense]]'' and ''[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]]'' - unmistakably Mexican horns are often used.\n\nDifferent individual projects create Nortec music. There is also a \"Colectivo Visual\": a group of designers and VJs who take care of the visual side of Nortec live shows. The term Nortec is a conjunction of norteño (\"of\" or \"from the North\") and techno, but mainly describes the collision between the music, style and culture of electronic music with those of norteño and tambora, two music genres indigenous to the North of Mexico. These styles are characterized by their use of accordions and double bass (norteño); tubas, clarinets, horns and pumping bass drums (tambora) and quirky use of percussion and polyrhythmic snare drum rolls (both). All of these elements are used to create a sound that is very Tijuana-like.",
