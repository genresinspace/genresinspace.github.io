  "description": "'''Nortec''' or '''nor-tec''' (from the combination of \"[[Norteño (music)|norteño]]\" and \"[[techno]]\") is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] developed in [[Tijuana]] (a border city in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]) that first gained popularity in 2001. Nortec music is characterized by hard dance beats and samples from traditional forms of Mexican music such as ''[[Banda music|Banda sinaloense]]'' and ''[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]]'' - unmistakably Mexican horns are often used.\n\nDifferent individual projects create nortec music. There is also a \"Colectivo Visual\": a group of designers and VJs who take care of the visual side of nortec live shows. The term nortec is a conjunction of norteño (\"of\" or \"from the North\") and techno, but mainly describes the collision between the music, style and culture of electronic music with those of [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] and tambora, two music genres indigenous to the North of Mexico. These styles are characterized by their use of accordions and double bass (norteño); tubas, clarinets, horns and pumping bass drums (tambora) and quirky use of percussion and polyrhythmic snare drum rolls (both). All of these elements are used to create a sound that is very Tijuana-like.",
