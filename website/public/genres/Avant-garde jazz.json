  "description": "'''Avant-garde jazz''' (also known as '''avant-jazz''', '''experimental jazz''', or '''\"new thing\"''') is a style of music and [[improvisation]] that combines [[avant-garde]] [[art music]] and composition with [[jazz]]. It originated in the early 1950s and developed through the late 1960s. One of the earliest developments within avant-garde jazz was that of [[free jazz]], and the two terms were originally synonymous. Much avant-garde jazz is stylistically distinct, however, in that it lacks free jazz's thoroughly improvised nature and is either fully or partially composed."
