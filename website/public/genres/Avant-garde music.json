  "description": "'''Avant-garde music''' is music that is considered to be at the forefront of innovation in its field, with the term \"[[avant-garde]]\" implying a critique of existing aesthetic conventions, rejection of the [[status quo]] in favor of unique or original elements, and the idea of deliberately challenging or alienating audiences. Avant-garde music may be distinguished from [[experimental music]] by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition, whereas experimental music lies outside tradition.",
