  "description": "'''Pub rock''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that emerged in the early to mid-1970s in the United Kingdom. A back-to-basics movement, which incorporated [[roots rock]], pub rock was a reaction against the expensively-recorded and produced [[progressive rock]] and flashy [[glam rock]] scenes at the time. Although short-lived, pub rock was played live in small traditional venues like [[pub]]s and clubs. Since major labels showed no interest in pub rock groups, pub bands sought out [[independent record label]]s such as [[Stiff Records]]. Indie labels used relatively inexpensive recording processes, so they had a much lower break-even point for a record than a major label.\n\nWith pub rock's emphasis on small venues, simple, fairly inexpensive recordings and indie record labels, it was the catalyst for the development of the British [[punk rock]] scene. Despite these shared elements, though, there was a difference between the genres: while pub rock harked back to early [[rock and roll]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], punk was [[iconoclast]]ic, and sought to break with the past musical traditions.",
