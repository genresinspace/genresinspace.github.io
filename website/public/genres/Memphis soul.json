  "description": "'''Memphis soul''', also known as the '''Memphis sound''', is the most prominent strain of [[Southern soul]]. It is a shimmering, sultry style produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], featuring melodic unison horn lines, organ, guitar, bass, and a driving beat on the drums.\n\nMany of the songs in this style were performed by vocalists backed by the house bands of [[Stax Records|Stax]], [[Hi Records|Hi]] and [[Goldwax Records]]. Memphis soul sound is different from the [[Motown Records|Motown sound]] from [[Detroit]] or the lighter sound of [[Chicago soul]]. After the rise of [[disco]] in the late 1970s, Memphis soul declined in popularity. The [[Stax Museum]] of American Soul Music is dedicated to preserving the Memphis sound.",
