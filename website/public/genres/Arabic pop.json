  "description": "'''Arabic pop music''' or '''Arab pop music''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[pop music]] and [[Arabic music]].\n\nArabic pop is mainly produced and originated in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]; with [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], as a secondary center. It is an outgrowth of the Arabic film industry (mainly [[Egypt]]ian movies), also predominantly located in Cairo. Since 2000, various locations in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf countries]] have been producing [[Khaliji (music)|Khaleeji]] pop music.\n\nThe primary style is a genre that synthetically combines pop melodies with elements of different Arabic regional styles, called ''ughniyah'' ({{langx|ar|أغنية}}) or in English \"Arabic song\". It uses mainly Western instruments, including electric [[guitar]]s or electronic [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], as well as traditional [[Middle Eastern]] instruments like the [[oud]] or [[Goblet drum|darbukka]].\n\nAnother characteristic aspect of Arabic pop is the overall tone and mood of the songs. The majority of the songs are in a minor key, and the lyrics tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife, and generally love issues.\n\nThe popularization of Arabic pop was largely due to the emergence of music videos, and the broadcast channels they were broadcast on, in the late 1970s. This multimedia technology allowed the easier spread of new perspectives within Arabic music. This visualization of Arab pop was a result of wanting to attract larger audiences and broaden singers' reputations with their younger audiences which further spread Arabic pop music.",
