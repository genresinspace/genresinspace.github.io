  "description": "'''Arabic pop music''' or '''Arab pop music''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[pop music]] and [[Arabic music]].\n\nArabic pop is mainly produced and originated in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]; with [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], as a secondary center. It is an outgrowth of the Arabic film industry (mainly [[Egypt]]ian movies), also predominantly located in Cairo. Since 2000, various locations in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf countries]] have been producing [[Khaliji (music)|Khaleeji]] pop music.\n\nThe primary style is a genre that synthetically combines pop melodies with elements of different Arabic regional styles, called ''ughniyah'' ({{langx|ar|أغنية}}) or in English \"Arabic song\". It uses mainly Western instruments, including electric [[guitar]]s or electronic [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], as well as traditional [[Middle Eastern]] instruments like the [[oud]] or [[Goblet drum|darbukka]].\n\nAnother characteristic aspect of Arabic pop is the overall tone and mood of the songs. The majority of the songs are in a minor key, and the lyrics tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife, and generally love issues.",
