  "description": "'''Samba rock''' (also known as '''samba soul''' or confused with '''[[samba funk]]''' and '''[[sambalanço]]''') is a Brazilian dance culture and [[music genre]] that fuses [[samba]] with [[rock music|rock]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[funk]]. It emerged from the dance parties of [[São Paulo]]'s lower-class [[Afro-Brazilians|black]] communities after they had been exposed to [[rock and roll]] and [[African-American music]] in the late 1950s.\n\nAs a development of 1960s [[música popular brasileira]], the genre was pioneered by recording acts such as [[Jorge Ben]], [[Tim Maia]], and [[Trio Mocotó]]. It gained a wider popularity in the following decades after breaking through into [[discotheque]]s. By the 2000s, samba rock had grown into a broader cultural movement involving dancers, disc jockeys, scholars, and musicians, who reinvented the genre in a modernized form."
