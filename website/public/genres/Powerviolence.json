  "description": "'''Powerviolence''' (sometimes written as '''power violence''') is a chaotic and fast subgenre of [[hardcore punk]] which is closely related to [[thrashcore]] and [[grindcore]]. In contrast with grindcore, which is a \"crossover\" idiom containing musical aspects of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], powerviolence is just an augmentation of the most challenging qualities of hardcore punk. Like its predecessors, it is usually socio-politically charged and [[iconoclastic]].",
