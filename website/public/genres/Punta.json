  "description": "'''Punta''' is an Afro-Indigenous dance and music genre of the [[Garífuna]] people in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]], originating from the [[Caribbean|Antillean]] island of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (known to the Garífuna as Yurumein). It incorporates [[Africa]]n and [[Kalinago]] elements, reflecting the hybrid nature of [[Garífuna culture]] and the [[Garífuna language]], though the language itself is primarily Arawakan with Kalinago and African lexical influences but not grammatically African. Punta is also known as banguity or bungiu in some Garífuna communities.\n\nThe diaspora of Garífuna people, commonly called the \"Garifuna Nation\", traces its ancestry to [[West Africa|West Africans]] who were shipwrecked captives who landed near [[Saint Vincent (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)|Saint Vincent]] in 1675 and to the Indigenous [[Arawak]] and [[Kalinago]] peoples. The survivors of the shipwreck integrated with the local populations, giving rise to the Garífuna people.\nPunta is used to reaffirm and express the struggles of the Garífuna people, highlighting their common heritage through cultural art forms such as dance and music, their strong sense of endurance, and their connection to their ancestors.Besides [[Honduras]], punta also has a following in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[United States]].\n\nLyrics may be in Garifuna, [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]], [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Most songs are performed in the indigenous Arawakan languages of the Garinagu and are often simply contemporary adaptations of traditional Garífuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Garífuna culture, Punta is danced specifically at Garífuna funerals, on beaches, and in parks. Punta is iconic of Garífuna ethnicity and modernity and can be seen as poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sounds. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta.",
