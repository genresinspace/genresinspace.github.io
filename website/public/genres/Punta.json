  "description": "'''Punta''' is an Afro-indigenous dance and cultural music of the Belizean, Guatemalan, Honduran and Nicaraguan [[Garífuna]] people, originating from the Caribbean island of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (also known as Yurumein). It has [[Africa|African]] and [[Arawak]] elements which are also the characteristics of the [[Garífuna language]]. It is also known as '''banguity''' or '''bangidi'''. \n\nThe diaspora of Garífuna people, commonly called the \"Garifuna Nation\", traces its ancestry back to those Shipwrecked West African Captives from the Bight of Biafra and the Indigenous Arawak and [[Kalinago]] peoples. Punta is used to reaffirm and express the struggle felt by the indigenous population's common heritage through cultural artforms such as dance and music; to highlight their strong sense of endurance; and reconnect to their ancestors. Besides [[Honduras]], punta also has a following in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]], and the [[United States]].\n\nLyrics may be in Garifuna, [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]], [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Most songs are performed in the indigenous Arawakan languages of the Garinagu and are often simply contemporary adaptations of traditional Garífuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Garífuna culture, Punta is danced specifically at Garífuna funerals, on beaches, and in parks. Punta is iconic of Garífuna ethnicity and modernity and can be seen as poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sounds. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta.",
