  "description": "'''{{lang|de|Kosmische Musik}}''' (\"cosmic music\") is a term which came into regular use before \"krautrock\" and was preferred by some German artists who disliked the English label; today, it is often used synonymously with krautrock. More specifically, it may describe 1970s German [[electronic music]] which uses [[synthesizers]] and incorporates [[Space-themed music|themes related to space]] or otherworldliness;{{sfn|Adelt|2016}} it is also used as a German analogue to the English term \"[[space rock]]\". The style was often instrumental and characterized by \"spacy\", [[ambient music|ambient]] soundscapes.{{sfn|Adelt|2016}} Artists used synthesizers such as the [[EMS VCS 3]] and [[Moog modular synthesizer|Moog Modular]], as well as sound processing effects and tape-based approaches. They often rejected [[rock music]] conventions, and instead drew on \"serious\" electronic compositions.{{sfn|Adelt|2016}}\n\nThe term \"kosmische Musik\" was coined by [[Edgar Froese]] and later used by record producer [[Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser]] as a marketing name for bands such as [[Ash Ra Tempel]], Tangerine Dream, and [[Klaus Schulze]].{{sfn|Adelt|2016|p=12}} The following year, [[Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser]]'s [[Ohr Records]] used the term when he released the compilation ''Kosmische Musik'' (1972) featuring tracks by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, Ash Ra Tempel, and [[Popol Vuh (band)|Popol Vuh]]. Kaiser eventually began referring to the style as \"cosmic rock\" to signify that the music belonged in a rock idiom. German producer [[Conny Plank]] was a central figure in the kosmische sound, emphasizing texture, [[sound effects|effects processing]], and tape-based editing techniques. Plank oversaw kosmische recordings such as [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'', [[Neu!]]'s ''[[Neu! 75]]'', and [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]'s ''[[Zuckerzeit]]''.\n\nSeveral of these artists would later distance themselves from the term. Other names for the style, and for sub-genres were \"[[Berlin School of electronic music|Berlin School]]\" and \"Dusseldorf School\", both of which are recognised and actively contributed to by artists such as Node, Martin Sturtzer, Propaganda, Kraftwerk, Tannheuser and Fritz Mayr, from the 1980s through to the present day. The style would later lead to the development of [[new-age music]], with which it shared several characteristics.{{sfn|Adelt|2016}} It would also exert lasting influence on subsequent electronic music and [[avant-garde rock]].",
