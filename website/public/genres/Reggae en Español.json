  "description": "In Panama, dancehall reggae sung in [[Spanish language]] by artists of Latin American origin is known as '''''Reggae en Español''''' (in English, '''Spanish reggae'''). It originated in the late 1980s in Panama. ''Reggae en Español'' goes by several names; in Panama, it is called \"''La Plena panameña''\".\n\nCurrently, reggae en Español contains three main subgenres: '''reggae 110''', '''''reggae bultrón''''', and '''romantic flow'''. In addition, and although technically they would not fall into the category of ''reggae en Español'' even though it derived from Jamaican dancehall rhythms, ''reggae en Español'' also includes two music fusions: Spanish dancehall and [[reggae soca]].",
