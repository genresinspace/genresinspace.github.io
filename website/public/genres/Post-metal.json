  "description": "'''Post-metal''' is a music genre rooted in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] but exploring approaches beyond metal conventions. It emerged in the 1990s with bands such as [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Godflesh]], who transformed metal [[texture (music)|texture]] through [[experimental music|experimental]] composition. In a way similar to the predecessor genres [[post-rock]] and [[post-hardcore]], post-metal offsets the darkness and intensity of [[extreme metal]] with an emphasis on atmosphere, emotion, and even \"[[revelation]]\", developing an expansive but introspective sound variously imbued with elements of [[ambient music|ambient]], [[noise music|noise]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[progressive music|progressive]], and [[classical music]], and often [[shoegaze]] and [[art rock]]. Songs are typically long, with loose and layered structures that discard the [[verseâ€“chorus form]] in favor of [[crescendo]]s and repeating [[Theme (music)|theme]]s. The sound centres on guitars (subjected to various [[Effects unit|effects]]) and drums, while any vocals are often but not always [[screaming (music)|screamed]] or [[death growl|growled]] and resemble an additional instrument.\n\nPost-metal is related to other experimental styles of metal: [[avant-garde metal]], [[drone metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[industrial metal]]. It has also been called '''metalgaze''' and '''art metal''', highlighting its connection to [[shoegaze]] (an [[indie music]] style related to post-rock) and [[art music]], respectively. Contemporary post-metal, pioneered by diverse groups such as [[Isis (band)|Isis]], [[Agalloch]], [[Boris (band)|Boris]], [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]], [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]], [[Wolves in the Throne Room]], and [[Russian Circles]], typically employs the deep heaviness of [[doom metal]] and [[sludge metal]] and/or the dark ferocity of [[black metal]]. The widespread acclaim of [[Deafheaven]], who succeeded [[Alcest]] in combining black metal and shoegaze (a fusion nicknamed [[blackgaze]]), made this global post-metal underground more visible.",
