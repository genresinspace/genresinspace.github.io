''The Ashgate Research Companion to Popular Musicology'' describes folktronica as \"a catch-all [term] for all manner of artists who have combined mechanical dance beats with elements of acoustic rock or folk\".\n\nThe 1991 album ''[[Every Man and Woman is a Star]]'' by [[Ultramarine (band)|Ultramarine]] was described in a 2014 [[PopMatters]] article as a progenitor of the genre; it featured a [[pastoral]] sound and incorporated traditional instruments such as violin and harmonica with [[techno]] and [[house music|house]] elements. In the early 2000s, indie electronic acts such as [[Múm]], [[Four Tet]], [[Isan (band)|Isan]], [[Bibio]] and [[the Books]] began releasing formative music in the genre. According to ''The Sunday Times Culture's Encyclopedia of Modern Music'', essential albums of the genre are Four Tet's [[Pause (Four Tet album)|''Pause'']] and [[Rounds (album)|''Rounds'']] (2001), [[Tunng]]'s ''[[Mother's Daughter and Other Songs]]'' (2005), and [[Caribou (musician)|Caribou]]'s ''[[The Milk of Human Kindness]]'' (2005).",
