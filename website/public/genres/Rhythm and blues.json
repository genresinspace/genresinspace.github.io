  "description": "'''Rhythm and blues''', frequently abbreviated as '''R&B''' or '''R'n'B''', is a genre of [[popular music]] that originated within [[African American]] communities in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when \"rocking, [[jazz]] based music&nbsp;... [with a] heavy, insistent beat\" was starting to become more popular.\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for [[freedom]] and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations.\n\nThe term \"rhythm and blues\" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to [[blues]] records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of [[rock and roll]], the term \"R&B\" became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated [[electric blues]], as well as [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]]. By the 1970s, the term \"rhythm and blues\" had changed once again and was used as a blanket term for soul and [[funk]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as \"[[contemporary R&B]]\". This contemporary form combines rhythm and blues with various elements of [[pop music|pop]], soul, funk, [[disco]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic music]].",
