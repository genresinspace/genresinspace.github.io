  "description": "'''Zolo''' is a music [[microgenre]] coined by radio DJ Terry Sharkie in the 1990s for his live radio show known as the \"Zany Zolo Musik Hour\". The genre is characterized by \"quirky\" and whimsical lyrics over adventurous, often complex arrangements, as well as jerky, rapid, vocal styles. The term was originally  used by Sharkie to refer to a subset of songs from [[avant-garde]], [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[art rock]] artists like [[Frank Zappa]], [[Gentle Giant]], [[the Residents]] and [[Renaldo and the Loaf]], as well as the more absurd side of new wave with artists such as [[Devo]], [[XTC]], [[Cardiacs]] and [[Oingo Boingo]], who incorporated influences from [[art punk]] and [[post-punk]]. During the 2000s, new wave revival bands such as the Oblong Boys and Zom Zoms appeared describing their music as \"zolo\", while drawing influences from [[synth-punk]].",
