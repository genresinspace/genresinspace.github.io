  "description": "'''Zolo''' is a [[microgenre]] of music coined by radio DJ Terry Sharkie in the 1990s for his live radio show known as the \"Zany Zolo Musik Hour\". The genre is characterized by \"quirky\" and whimsical lyrics over adventurous, often complex arrangements, and was used to refer to a subset of songs from [[avant-garde]] artists like [[Renaldo and the Loaf]], [[the Residents]] and [[Frank Zappa]], electronic musicians such as [[Dick Hyman]] or [[Perrey and Kingsley]], [[progressive rock]]/[[art rock]] outfits like [[Gentle Giant]] and [[Cardiacs]], and the more absurd side of [[new wave]] with artists such as [[Devo|DEVO]], [[Oingo Boingo]] and [[Spizzenergi]]. During the 2000s, new wave revival bands such as the Oblong Boys and Zom Zoms appeared describing their music as \"zolo\", while drawing influences from [[post-punk]] and [[synth-punk]].",
