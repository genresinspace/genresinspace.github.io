  "description": "'''Mandopop''' or '''mandapop''' refers to [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] [[popular music]]. The genre originated from the jazz-influenced popular music of 1930s [[Shanghai]] known as [[Shidaiqu]]; later influences included Japanese [[enka]], Hong Kong's [[Cantopop]], Taiwan's [[Hokkien pop]], and particularly the [[campus folk song]] folk movement of the 1970s. \"Mandopop\" may be used as a general term to describe popular songs performed in Mandarin. Though mandopop predates [[cantopop]], the English term \"mandopop\" was coined around 1980 after \"cantopop\" became a popular term for describing popular songs in [[Cantonese]]. \"Mandopop\" was used to describe Mandarin-language popular songs of that time, some of which were versions of cantopop songs sung by the same singers with different lyrics to suit the different rhyme and tonal patterns of Mandarin.\n\nMandopop is categorized as a [[genre|subgenre]] of commercial [[Chinese language]] music within [[C-pop]]. Popular music sung in Mandarin was the first variety of popular music in Chinese to establish itself as a viable [[music industry|industry]]. It originated in [[Shanghai]]; later, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taipei]] and [[Beijing]] also emerged as important centers of the mandopop music industry. Among the regions and countries where mandopop is most popular are [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Singapore]].",
