  "description": "'''Progressive pop''' is [[pop music]] that attempts to break with the genre's standard formula, or an offshoot of the [[progressive rock]] genre that was commonly heard on [[AM radio]] in the 1970s and 1980s. It was originally termed for the [[Proto-prog|early progressive rock of the 1960s]]. Some stylistic features of progressive pop include [[hook (music)|hooks]] and [[earworms]], unorthodox or colorful instrumentation, changes in [[key (music)|key]] and [[rhythm]], experiments with larger [[musical form|forms]], and unexpected, disruptive, or ironic treatments of past conventions.\n\nThe movement started as a byproduct of the mid-1960s economic boom, when record labels began investing in artists and allowing performers limited control over their own content and marketing. Groups who combined [[rock and roll]] with various other music styles such as Indian [[raga]]s and [[Music of Asia|Asian-influenced]] melodies ultimately influenced the creation of progressive rock (or \"prog\"). When prog records began declining in sales, some artists returned to a more accessible sound that remained commercially appealing until the 1990s.\n\n{{toclimit|4}}",
