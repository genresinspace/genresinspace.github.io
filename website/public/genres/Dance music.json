  "description": "'''Dance music''' is [[music]] composed specifically to facilitate or accompany [[dance|dancing]]. It can be either a whole piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are [[Concert|live]] dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in [[ancient history]] (for example [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek vases]] sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are old-fashioned dances. In the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period, the major dance styles were [[noble court]] dances (see [[Baroque dance]]). In the [[classical music era]], the [[minuet]] was frequently used as a third [[movement (music)|movement]], although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The [[waltz]] also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the [[romantic music]] period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the [[barcarolle]], [[mazurka]], [[ecossaise]], [[Ballade (classical music)|ballade]] and [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]].\n\nModern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[social dance]] music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the [[working class]] who attended public [[dance hall]]s. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, known as the Swing era, [[Swing music]] was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, [[rock and roll]] became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] music. Dominican and Cuban New Yorkers created the popular [[Salsa (dance)|salsa dance]] in the late 1960s which stemmed from the Latin music genre of [[Salsa music|salsa]]. The rise of [[disco]] in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, [[electronic dance music]] was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of [[popular music]] commonly played in [[nightclub]]s, [[radio station]]s, [[concert|shows]] and [[rave]]s. Many [[List of electronic music genres|subgenres of electronic dance music]]  have evolved.",
