  "description": "'''Bassline''' (sometimes referred to as '''bassline house''' or '''4x4''' or '''niche''') is a music genre closely related to [[UK garage]] that originated in [[South Yorkshire]] and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in the early 2000s. Stylistically it comprises a [[four-to-the-floor]] rhythm normally at around 135â€“142 [[beats per minute]] and a strong emphasis on [[bass (sound)|bass]], similar to that of its precursor [[speed garage]], with chopped up vocal samples and a [[pop music]] aesthetic. The genre is often confused with [[grime music]] however deviates from grime's aggressive electronic sound and rapid syncopated breakbeats instead it has a more mainstream friendly sound.\n\nParticularly in the scene's early days, the most prominent bassline club was [[Sheffield]]'s Niche Nightclub, which became the centre of controversy due to a [[police raid]] which resulted in the club's closure in 2005."
