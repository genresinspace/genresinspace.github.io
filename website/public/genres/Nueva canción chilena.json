  "description": "'''{{Lang|es|Nueva canción chilena|italic=no}}''' ({{langx|en|new Chilean song}}) was a movement and genre of Chilean music incorporating strong political and social themes, taking influences from traditional or [[folk music]] of Chile. The movement was to spread throughout [[Latin America]] during the 1960s and 1970s, in what is called \"[[Nueva canción]]\" sparking the renewal in traditional folk music and playing a key role in political movements in the region.\n\nThe foundations of the Chilean New Song were laid through the efforts of [[Violeta Parra]] to revive over 3,000 Chilean songs, [[Chilean cuisine|recipes]], [[Culture of Chile|traditions]], and proverbs, and it eventually aligned with the 1970 presidential campaign of Salvador Allende, incorporating the songs of [[Víctor Jara]], [[Inti-Illimani]] and [[Quilapayún]] among others.\n\nOther key proponents of the movement include [[Patricio Manns]], [[Rolando Alarcón]], [[Payo Grondona]], [[Patricio Castillo (folk musician)|Patricio Castillo]], [[Homero Caro]], and [[Kiko Álvarez]], as well as non-Chilean musicians, such as [[César Isella]] and [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]] from Argentina and [[Paco Ibáñez]] from Spain.",
