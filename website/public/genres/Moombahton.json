  "description": "'''Moombahton''' ({{IPAc-en|'|m|uː|m|b|ə|t|ɒ|n}}, {{respell|MOOM|bə-ton}}) is an [[electronic dance music]] genre, derived from [[house music]] and [[reggaeton]], that was created by American [[Disc jockey|DJ]] and [[music producer|producer]] [[Dave Nada]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 2009. Nada coined the name as a [[portmanteau]] of \"Moombah\" (a track by Surinamese house DJ [[Chuckie (DJ)|Chuckie]] and Dutch producer/DJ Silvio Ecomo) and reggaeton (itself a neologism combining [[reggae]] with the Spanish suffix ''-ton'', signifying big)."
