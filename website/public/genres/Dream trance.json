  "description": "'''Dream trance''' is an early subgenre of [[trance music]] that peaked prominently on the international dance scene between 1995 and 1998 (colliding with the first time for trance to reach mainstream). The \"dream\" term has been known to largely influence [[house music]] in general, and therefore the subgenre is also known as '''dream house''' or '''dream dance''' on some occasions.\n\nToday, dream trance is considered to be the first and the most primitive derivative of the [[progressive house]] movement that started around 1992. Many [[psytrance]] producers emergent at the time (notably [[Infected Mushroom]]) were also influenced by it.",
