  "description": "'''Cumbia villera''' ({{IPA|es|ˈkumbja βiˈʎeɾa|}}) (roughly translated as \"[[slum]] cumbia\", \"[[ghetto]] cumbia\", or \"[[shantytown]] cumbia\", from ''[[villa miseria]]'', \"slum\") is a subgenre of [[cumbia]] music originating in [[Argentina]] in the late 1990s and popularized all over [[Latin America]] and Latin communities abroad.\n\nLyrically, cumbia villera uses the vocabulary of the marginal and lower classes, like the Argentine ''[[lunfardo]]'' and ''lenguaje tumbero'' (\"gangster language\" or \"thug language\"), and deals with themes such as the everyday life in the ''villas miseria'' (slums), poverty and misery, the use of hard drugs, promiscuity and/or prostitution, nights out at ''boliches'' (discos and clubs) that play cumbia and other tropical music genres (such as the emblematic ''Tropitango'' venue in [[General Pacheco|Pacheco]]), the [[Association football|football]] culture of the [[Barra brava|barras bravas]], delinquency and clashes with the police and other forms of authority, antipathy towards politicians, and authenticity in being true ''villeros'' (inhabitants of the ''villas'').\n\nMusically, cumbia villera bases its sound in a heavy use of [[synthesizer]]s, sound effects, keyboard voices, [[keytar]]s, [[electronic drum]]s, and other elements from [[electric instrument]]s. Cumbia villera's characteristic sound was created using influences from [[Colombia]]n and [[Peruvian cumbia]], ''cumbia sonidera'' and ''cumbia [[Santa Fe Province|santafesina]]'' in the realm of cumbia, and from [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Argentine folklore]], and [[electronic music]] in other music genres. Lastly, the creator of cumbia villera, [[Pablo Lescano]], admitted that his lyrics were influenced by bands from Argentine [[punk rock]], like [[2 Minutos]] and Argentine rock [[rolinga]], like [[Viejas Locas]]. Over time, the genre has evolved, bands and artists have explored different sounds, and new fusions have arisen, such as [[cumbia rapera]], with [[Bajo Palabra]] mixing cumbia villera with [[hip hop]], and [[tropipunk]], with [[Kumbia Queers]] mixing cumbia villera with [[punk rock|punk]].\n\nFor its characteristics, cumbia villera has been compared to [[gangsta rap]], [[reggaeton]], rock rolinga, [[ragga]]muffin, [[baile funk]], and [[narcocorrido]], among other music genres.",
