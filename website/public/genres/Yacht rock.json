  "description": "'''Yacht rock''' (originally known as the '''West Coast sound''' or '''adult-oriented rock''') is a broad music style and aesthetic commonly associated with [[soft rock]], one of the most commercially successful genres from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. Drawing on sources such as [[smooth soul]], [[smooth jazz]], [[R&B]], and [[disco]], common stylistic traits include high-quality production, clean vocals, and a focus on light, catchy melodies. The term {{em|yacht rock}} was coined in 2005 by the makers of the online comedy video series ''[[Yacht Rock (web series)|Yacht Rock]]'', who connected the music with the popular [[Southern California]]n leisure activity of [[boating]]. It was considered a pejorative term by some music critics.",
