  "description": "A '''nightcore''' (also known as ''sped-up song'', ''sped-up version'', ''sped-up remix'', or, simply, ''sped-up'') edit is a version of a [[music track]] that speeds up its source material by approximately 35%, which also raises the pitch. This gives an effect almost identical to playing a [[LP record|33⅓-rpm vinyl record]] at [[Single (music)#7-inch format|45 rpm]]. The 35% increase in speed causes the note [[Middle C|C<sub>4</sub>]] to be slightly lower in pitch than the note [[F♯ (musical note)|F#<sub>4</sub>]] (from 261.63&nbsp;Hz to 353.19&nbsp;Hz), which is an increase of approximately 5 and a half [[semitone]]s. Playing 33⅓-rpm vinyl records at 45 rpm was common in the Happy Hardcore scene of the 90s and 2000s, which most likely inspired this genre.\n\nThe name is derived from the Norwegian musical duo \"Nightcore\", who released pitch-shifted versions of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[Eurodance]] songs. Nightcore is also almost always associated with and accompanied by [[anime]] and [[otaku]] culture; many [[YouTube]] [[thumbnail]]s (and similar features) of nightcore remixes contain anime characters and art.\n\nNightcore saw a general resurgence in popularity in the early 2020s due to [[TikTok]], causing major recording labels to officially release sped-up versions of their songs.",
