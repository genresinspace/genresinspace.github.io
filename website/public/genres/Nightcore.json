  "description": "A '''nightcore''' (also known as sped-up song, sped-up version, sped-up remix, or sped-up edit) is a version of a music track that increases the pitch and speeds up its source material by approximately 35%. This gives an effect identical to playing a 33⅓-RPM vinyl record at 45 RPM.\n\nThe name is derived from the Norwegian musical duo \"Nightcore\" ({{IPA|no|ˈnɑɪ̯tkɔːɾ}}), who released pitch-shifted versions of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[Eurodance]] songs. Nightcore is also almost always associated and accompanied with [[anime]] and [[otaku]] culture, with many [[YouTube]] [[thumbnail]]s, and similar formats, of nightcore remixes containing anime characters and art.\n\nNightcore saw a general resurgence in popularity in the early 2020s due to [[TikTok]], causing [[Major record label|major recording labels]] to officially release \"sped-up\" versions of their songs.",
