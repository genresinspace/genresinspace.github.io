The music originally had a clean and minimal [[musical production|production style]] that was associated with techno from [[Detroit techno|Detroit]] and the UK.\n\nIn the mid to late 1990s, a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by the former [[The Shamen|Shamen]] rapper [[Mr C]] (Richard West) & Paul \"Rip\" Stone (co-founder with West of Plink Plonk), Heart & Soul and Wiggle run by [[Terry Francis]] and [[Nathan Coles]].
