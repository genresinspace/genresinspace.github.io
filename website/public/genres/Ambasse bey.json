The music is based on commonly available instruments, especially [[guitar]], with [[percussion]] provided by sticks and bottles. The music is faster-paced than [[assiko]].\n\nJohn Hall described its rhythm as the one of a moving broom. Where dancers swing their shoulders like the wings of birds, the dance is composed of sequences of fluid steps and jerky body movements performed in accordance with the music, which is generally the [[makossa]]. In order to perform this dance, the dancers must wear traditional [[sawa people|sawa]] outfits.\n\nAmbasse bey originated among the [[Yabassi (people)|Yabassi]] ethnic group and grew popular in [[Douala]] after [[World War II]]. Through the 1950s and 1960s, the style evolved in the Cameroonian [[Littoral Province (Cameroon)|Littoral]]. In the mid-1960s, [[Eboa Lotin]] performed a style of ambasse bey on harmonica and guitar that was the earliest form of [[makossa]], a style that quickly came to overshadow its predecessor and become Cameroon's most popular form of indigenous music. Ambasse bey was revived to an extent by Cameroonian singer [[Sall√© John]]."
