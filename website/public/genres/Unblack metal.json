  "description": "'''Unblack metal''' (also known as '''Christian black metal''' or '''White metal''') is a religious philosophy and subgenre within [[black metal]], inheriting several characteristics of it, such as the [[Black metal#Instrumentation and song structure|melody]], the [[Black metal#Vocals and lyrics|lyrics]] and the [[Black metal#Imagery and performances|aesthetics]] ([[corpse paint]]), whose artists either directly oppose the [[Satanism]] prevalent in most black metal, or promote [[Christianity]] in their lyrics and imagery. Unblack metal artists are controversial within the black metal subculture, because black metal's pioneers, especially those of the Second Wave, were [[anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]]. It is also suggested that Christianity contradicts black metal's dark nature and the [[individualism|individualistic]] and [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] ideals of many bands.\n\nThe exact beginning of the unblack metal movement is disputed. The Australian band [[Horde (band)|Horde]]'s 1994 album ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'' brought the concept and the term \"holy unblack metal\" (a word play on [[Darkthrone]]'s slogan \"unholy black metal\" used on the albums ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]'' and ''[[Under a Funeral Moon]]'') to media attention, while the Norwegian band [[Antestor]] was already formed in 1990 as a [[death/doom]] act and released its demo ''[[The Defeat of Satan]]'' in 1991, before they began shifting towards unblack metal on their 1994 album ''[[Martyrium (album)|Martyrium]]''.",
