  "description": "'''Makossa''' is a [[music genre]] originating in [[Douala]], [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region, Cameroon]] in the late 20th century. Like much other [[music of Sub-Saharan Africa]], it uses strong [[Electric bass amplifier|electric bass]] rhythms and prominent [[brass instrument|brass]]. Makossa uses [[guitar]] [[accompaniment]]s, in the forms of [[Solo guitar|solo]] and [[rhythm guitar]], with a main singer ([[lead vocalist]]) and a [[choir]] of [[backup singers]], with the focus being on the [[Timbre|texture]] of the guitar, the role it plays in the [[song]], the relationship between it and other [[Musical instrument|instruments]] (including the [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Drum kit|drum set]], [[Brass instrument|horns]], [[synthesizers]], etc.), the [[Lyrics|lyrical content]] and [[languages]] sung as well as their relationship (as far as timbre goes) with the music, the uses of various [[percussion instrument]]s, including the [[bottle]], the [[Groove (music)|groove]] of the bass as well as the drums, and the use of [[Music technology|technical knowledge]] and [[microprocessor]]s to make the music. It is in common time (4/4) for the vast majority of cases. Language-wise, it is typically sung in [[French language|French]], [[Duala language|Duala]] or [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin English]]. Tempo-wise, it is typically in between 130 and 170 [[Tempo|BPM]]. It traditionally consisted of [[Guitar picking|guitar-picking techniques]] that borrows from [[bikutsi]]; with a guitar-structure of a guitar switching from solo to rhythm from [[assiko]]; supplanted with complex bass grooves, and gradually picked up on brass section, from [[funk]] and later in the 70s, string section, from disco. It along with this acquired the [[sebene]] from Congolese rumba. In the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent abroad. It is considered to be one of the greatest Cameroonian and even African \"adventures\" as a music.\n\nMakossa, which in some accounts is said to mean \"the contortions\" and others to mean \"(I) dance\" in the [[Douala language|Duala language]], originated from a [[Duala people|Duala]] [[dance]] called the ''kossa''. Emmanuel Nelle Eyoum started using the refrain ''kossa kossa'' in his songs with his group \"Los Calvinos\". The style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later. There were artists such as [[Eboa Lotin]], François Missé Ngoh and especially [[Manu Dibango]], who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" in 1972. It is the most [[Sampled (music)|sampled]] [[Africa]]n song, in history to date. The chant from the song, ''mamako, mamasa, maka makossa'', was later used by [[Michael Jackson]] in \"[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]\" in 1983. In 2007, [[Rihanna]] similarly sampled it too for [[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|\"Don't Stop The Music]]\". Many other performers followed suit. The 2010 World cup also brought makossa to the international stage as [[Shakira]] sampled the [[Golden Sounds]] popular song \"[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)]]\".",
