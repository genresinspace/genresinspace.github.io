  "description": "A '''big band''' (historically referred to as '''jazz orchestra''') is a type of [[musical ensemble]] of [[jazz music]] that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: [[saxophone]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, and a [[rhythm section]]. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated [[jazz]] in the early 1940s when [[swing music|swing]] was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.\n\nBig bands started as accompaniment for dancing the [[Lindy Hop]]. In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.",
