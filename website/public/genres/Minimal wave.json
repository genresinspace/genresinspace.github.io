  "description": "'''Minimal wave''' is a broad classification of music that comprises obscure, atypical examples of genres such as [[New wave music|new wave]], stripped-down electronic or synthesizer music, [[synth-pop]], [[post-punk]], and [[cold wave (music)|coldwave]]. Most of the music tends to focus on electronic, pre-[[MIDI]] instrumentation and themes of sincere, rather than ironic, detachment.\n\nThe term \"minimal wave\" draws some contention. Although much minimal wave is classified in the late 1970s and early 1980s and subsequently appeared on bootleg and one-off compilations, the genre did not have a name until a [[Minimal Wave Records|record label of the same name]] began releasing compilations and reissues in the mid-2000s.",
