  "description": "'''Sludge metal''' (also known as '''sludge doom''' or simply '''sludge''') is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]] that combines elements of [[doom metal]] and [[hardcore punk]]. The genre generally includes slow tempos, down-tuned guitars and nihilistic lyrics discussing poverty, drug addiction and pollution.\n\nThe sound of sludge metal has its origins in California hardcore punk bands in the early-to-mid-1980s like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Fang (band)|Fang]], who began slowing their tempos and embracing the influence of [[Black Sabbath]]. This sound was expanded upon by the [[Melvins]] towards the end of the decade and the bands they influenced in both the Seattle [[grunge]] scene, and in Louisiana with [[Eyehategod]], [[Crowbar (American band)|Crowbar]] and [[Acid Bath]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, the sound of sludge diversified: bands including [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], [[Isis (band)|Isis]] and [[Cult of Luna]] helped to pioneer [[post-metal]], while [[Baroness (band)|Baroness]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] fused the genre with [[progressive metal]], while [[Dystopia (band)|Dystopia]] did so with [[crust punk]] and [[Grief (band)|Grief]] with [[anarcho-punk]].",
