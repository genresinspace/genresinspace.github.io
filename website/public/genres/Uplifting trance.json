  "description": "'''Uplifting trance''' (often synonymous with '''epic trance''', '''energetic trance''', '''anthem trance''', '''emotional trance''', or '''euphoric trance''') is a broad subgenre of [[trance music]]. The name, which emerged in the wake of [[progressive trance]] in 1996, is derived from the feeling which listeners claim to get (often described as a \"rush\"). The genre is popular in the trance scene. Classical music strongly influenced the development of uplifting trance both in the 1990s and in the 2000s, with film music also considered influential.",
