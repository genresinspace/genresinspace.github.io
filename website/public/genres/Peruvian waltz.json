  "description": "The '''vals criollo''' ({{langx|en|Creole waltz}}), or '''Peruvian waltz''' ({{langx|es|vals peruano}}), is an adaptation of the European [[waltz]] brought to the [[Americas]] during colonial times by [[Spain]]. In the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], the waltz was gradually adapted to the likings of the [[Criollo (people)|Criollo]] people.  In the 20th century, the genre became symbolic of the nation's culture as it gained widespread popularity in the country. It also became popular outside of Peru, particularly in [[Argentina]], where local artists composed many notable Peruvian waltz compositions such as [[Amarraditos]] and [[Que nadie sepa mi sufrir]]."
