It has occasionally seen mainstream [[pop music|pop]] success but is typically explored within [[alternative music]], [[Independent music|indie music]] and [[underground music|underground]] scenes.\n\nNeo-psychedelia first developed in the late-1970s as an outgrowth of the British [[post-punk]] scene.
