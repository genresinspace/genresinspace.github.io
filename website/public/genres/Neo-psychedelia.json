  "description": "'''Neo-psychedelia''' is a genre of [[psychedelic music]] that draws inspiration from the music production approaches and songwriting of [[Psychedelic music#1960s: Original psychedelic era|1960s psychedelia]], either exploring emulations of the sounds of the era or applying its ethos to new styles of music. It has occasionally seen mainstream [[pop music|pop]] success but is typically explored within [[alternative music]], [[Independent music|indie music]] and [[underground music|underground]] scenes.\n\nNeo-psychedelia first developed in the late-1970s as an outgrowth of the British [[post-punk]] scene, where it was also known as '''acid punk'''. A neo-psychedelic wave of British alternative rock in the 1980s spawned the subgenres of [[dream pop]] and [[shoegaze]]. Neo-psychedelia may also include forays into [[psychedelic pop]], [[jangle pop|jangly guitar rock]], heavily distorted free-form jams, or [[Recording studio as an instrument|recording experiments]].",
