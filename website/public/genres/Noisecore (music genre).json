  "description": "'''Noisecore''' is an extreme subgenre of [[hardcore punk]] characterized by chaotic structures, extreme distortion, blast beats, and noise-laden soundscapes. It often rejects conventional song formats, musical theory, and intelligible lyrics in favor of short, intense bursts of raw, aggressive sound. Noisecore is a genre totally different from [[Mathcore]] even people confuses the two genre.",
