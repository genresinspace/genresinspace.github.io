  "description": "'''Zamrock''' is a [[music genre]] and scene that emerged in [[Zambia]] during the early 1970s. It has been described as a fusion of traditional [[African music|African]] music and [[psychedelic rock]], [[garage rock]], [[hard rock]], [[Blues music|blues]] and [[funk]], taking influence from popular bands like [[Black Sabbath]], [[Blue Cheer]], the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Deep Purple]], and [[Cream (band)|Cream]].\n\nRock musician Rikki Ililonga and his band Musi-O-Tunya are widely regarded as the inventors of this style of music. Other notable artists include [[Witch (Zamrock band)|WITCH]], [[The Peace]], [[Amanaz]], Chrissy \"Zebby\" Tembo, and [[Paul Ngozi]] and his Ngozi Family.\n\nThough it is no longer as popular in the country as it once was due to Zambia's economic difficulties in the late 1970s, Zamrock has seen a recent resurgence, led by former WITCH member Emmanuel Chanda, better known as Jagari.",
