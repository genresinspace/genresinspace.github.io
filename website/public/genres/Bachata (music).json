  "description": "'''Bachata''' is a genre of music that originated in the  [[Dominican Republic]] in the 20th century. It contains elements of European (mainly [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]]), indigenous [[Taino]] and African musical elements, representing the [[Culture of the Dominican Republic|cultural diversity]] of the Dominican population. A form of dance, [[Bachata (dance)|bachata]], also developed with the music.\n\nIn the 1990s bachata's instrumentation changed from nylon string Spanish guitar and maracas of [[traditional bachata]] to the [[electric guitar|electric steel string]] and guira of modern bachata. Bachata further transformed in the 21st century with the creation of urban bachata styles by bands such as [[Monchy y Alexandra]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]]. These new modern styles of bachata became an international phenomenon, and today bachata is one of the most popular styles of Latin music.\n\nThe original term used to name the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness\", \"bitter music\"), until the mood-neutral term ''bachata'' became popular. The genre mixed these and the troubadour singing tradition common in Latin America (and later, from the mid-1980s, [[Merengue music|merengue]]). The first recognised bachata recorded was a [[Musical composition|composed]] by [[José Manuel Calderón (musician)|José Manuel Calderón]] in 1962 (\"Borracho de amor\").\n\n:\"It has been compared to the blues in the past in terms of, structurally, the kind of folks who were making it, people on the margins of society. It's a little more cheerful, though, than the blues. Even songs where they're singing about the treachery of a woman ... if you just listen to them musically, they still sound kind of sweet.\"<ref>{{Cite web |website=National Public Radio |date=July 31, 2008 |title=The Humble Roots Of Old-School Bachata |url=https://www.npr.org/2008/07/31/93140350/the-humble-roots-of-old-school-bachata}}</ref>",
