  "description": "'''Chicago blues''' is a form of [[blues]] music that developed in [[Chicago]], Illinois. It is based on earlier blues idioms, such as [[Delta blues]], but is performed in an [[Blues#Urban blues|urban style]].  It developed alongside the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration of African Americans]] of the first half of the twentieth century.  Key features that distinguish Chicago blues from the earlier traditions, such as Delta blues, are the prominent use of electrified instruments (especially the [[electric guitar]]), and the use of electronic effects, such as [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] and overdrive.\n\n[[Muddy Waters]], often acknowledged as the “father” of Chicago blues, was a colleague of Delta blues musicians [[Son House]] and [[Robert Johnson]]. He migrated to Chicago in 1943, joining the established [[Big Bill Broonzy]], where they developed a distinct style of the Chicago blues, which hit its peak around the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Joined by artists such as [[Willie Dixon]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], and [[John Lee Hooker]], Chicago blues reached an international audience by the late 1950s and early 1960s, directly influencing not only the development of early [[rock and roll]] musicians such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Bo Diddley]], but also reaching across the Atlantic to influence both [[British blues]] and early [[hard rock]] acts such as [[Eric Clapton]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Led Zeppelin]].  Prominent record labels such as [[Vee-Jay Records]] and [[Chess Records]] helped promote and spread the style.  The [[Chicago Blues Festival]] has been held annually since 1984, on the anniversary of Muddy Waters' death, as a means of preserving and promoting Chicago blues.",
