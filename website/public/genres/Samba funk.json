  "description": "'''Samba funk''' is a musical subgenre that fuses Brazilian [[samba]] and American [[funk]], created in the late 1960s by pianist [[Dom Salvador]] and the Brazilian band Grupo Abolição (which later gave rise to [[Banda Black Rio]]) and based on a blend of the binary measures of samba and the quaternary measures of funk, which had recently arrived on the Brazilian music market.{{Sfn|Kassel|2018}} \n\nBrazilian singers and bands such as [[Tim Maia]], [[Jorge Ben]] and [[Banda Black Rio]] have also pioneered into the genre.{{sfn|Medeiros|2006|p=36}}",
