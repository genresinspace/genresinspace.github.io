  "description": "'''{{lang|ht|Rasin}}''', also known as '''Haitian roots music''', is a musical style that began in [[Haiti]] in the 1970s, when musicians began combining elements of traditional [[Haitian Vodou]] ceremonial and folkloric music with various musical styles. The late 20th century style of this music links to the roots of Vodou tradition, where it came to be known as {{lang|ht|mizik rasin}} later in [[Haitian Creole]]. Modern-day, the movement is often referred to simply as \"{{lang|ht|rasin}}\" or \"{{lang|fr|racine}}\" (in French).",
