  "description": "'''Tribal guarachero''', also known as '''trival''', is a music genre that fuses [[electronic dance music]] with [[cumbia]] or certain rhythms from [[regional Mexican]] music genres.\n\nTribal guarachero is sometimes referred to as \"3ball\". Despite the similarity between the letter \"b\" and \"v\" in Spanish, it should not be confused with [[tribal house]] or [[tecnocumbia]] music."
