  "description": "'''Éntekhno''' ({{langx|el|έντεχνο}}, {{IPA|el|'endexno|pron}}, [[plural|pl]]: ''éntekhna'' [''tragoudia'']) is [[orchestral music]] with elements from Greek folk [[rhythm]] and [[melody]]. Its lyrical themes are often based on the work of famous Greek poets. Éntekhno arose in the late 1950s, drawing on [[rebetiko]]'s Westernization by [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]] and [[Manolis Chiotis]]. [[Mikis Theodorakis]] and [[Manos Hatzidakis]] were the most popular early composers of éntekhno [[song cycles]].",
