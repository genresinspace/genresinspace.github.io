  "description": "{{nihongo|'''Japanoise'''|ジャパノイズ|Japanoizu}}, a [[portmanteau]] of \"Japanese\" and \"noise\", is the [[noise music]] scene of Japan.\n\nNick Cain of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' identifies the \"primacy of Japanese Noise artists like [[Merzbow]], [[Hijokaidan]] and [[Incapacitants]] as one of the major developments in noise music since 1990.\n\nCertain Japanese noise artists themselves feel uncomfortable being categorized under the umbrella of \"Japanese noise\", arguing that use of the term is a way of ignoring the differences between musicians who don't necessarily follow the same approach or even know each other at all.",
