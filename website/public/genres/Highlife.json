  "description": "'''Highlife''' is a Ghanaian [[music genre]] that originated along the coastal cities of present-day [[Ghana]] in the 19th century, during its [[Gold Coast (region)|history as a colony]] of the British and through its trade routes in coastal areas. It encompasses multiple local fusions of African metre and western [[jazz]] melodies. It uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional African music, but is typically played with Western instruments. Highlife is characterized by [[jazz]]y [[Horn section|horns]] and [[guitar]]s which lead the band and its use of the two-finger plucking [[Guitar picking|guitar style]] that is typical of African music. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound.\n\nHighlife gained popularity and the genre spread throughout West African regions. Pioneers like [[Rex Lawson|Cardinal Rex Lawson]], [[E. T. Mensah|E.T. Mensah]], [[Victor Uwaifo]], all perfected this sound by infusing traditional Africa drums and western \"Native Blues\". After the Second World War, its popularity came within the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]], as they got influenced to form [[Igbo highlife]] which became their country's most popular music genre in the 1960s.\n\nHighlife has remained a part of popular music for Ghanaians and [[Ghanaian diaspora|their diaspora]] globally through its integration with religious institutions and the positive effect it had on immigrating Ghanaians leaving their homeland.",
