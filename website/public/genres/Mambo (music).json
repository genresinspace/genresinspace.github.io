  "description": "'''Mambo''' is a genre of Cuban dance music pioneered by the [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] [[Arcaño y sus Maravillas]] in the late 1930s and later popularized in the [[big band]] style by [[Pérez Prado]]. It originated as a syncopated form of the [[danzón]], known as [[danzón-mambo]], with a final, improvised section, which incorporated the ''[[guajeo]]s'' typical of [[son cubano]] (also known as ''[[montuno]]s''). These ''guajeos'' became the essence of the genre when it was played by big bands, which did not perform the traditional sections of the danzón and instead leaned towards [[swing music|swing]] and [[jazz]]. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, mambo had become a \"dance craze\" in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] as its [[mambo (dance)|associated dance]] took over the East Coast thanks to [[Pérez Prado]], [[Tito Puente]], [[Tito Rodríguez]] and others. In the mid-1950s, a slower ballroom style, also derived from the danzón, [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]], replaced mambo as the most popular dance genre in North America. Nonetheless, mambo continued to enjoy some degree of popularity into the 1960s and new derivative styles appeared, such as dengue; by the 1970s it had been largely incorporated into [[salsa music|salsa]].",
