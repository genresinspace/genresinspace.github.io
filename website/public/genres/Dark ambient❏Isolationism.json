  "description": "'''Isolationism''' (also known as '''isolationist ambient''') is a [[subgenre]] of dark ambient that was prominent in the 1990s. The term was coined by British musician [[Kevin Martin (British musician)|Kevin Martin]] and first appeared in print in a September 1993 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' magazine. He described it as a form of fractured, subdued music that \"pushed away\" listeners rather than comforting them. In 1994 Martin curated a compilation album, ''[[Isolationism (album)|Isolationism]]'', collecting various examples of the genre. Journalist David Segal referred to it as \"ambient's sinister, antisocial cousin\".\n\nJohn Everall, owner of the Sentrax label, placed the origins of \"Isolationist\" music in early [[Industrial music|industrial]] groups, [[krautrock]], ambient music and experimental composers such [[John Cage]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], and others. [[James Plotkin]] identified [[Brian Eno]]'s ambient works as an influence on the isolationist scene, along with American experimental bands such as Illusion of Safety. As Plotkin says, {{blockquote|I really didn't know what was meant by Isolationism [...], because it encompassed this broad spectrum of music that ranged from Ambient to avant garde music to even something more aggressive â€“ like the [[Japanoise|Japanese Noise]] scene. [...] ''[[Isolationism (album)|Isolationism]]'' was a Virgin compilation and it needed a marketing angle. And [compiler] Kevin Martin was definitely responsible for exposing a really large amount of people to music that would otherwise have gone unnoticed, so I guess it's not all bad.<ref name=Plotkin/>}}",
