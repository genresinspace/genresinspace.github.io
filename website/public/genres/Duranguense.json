  "description": "'''Duranguense''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[regional Mexican]] music. It is a hybrid of [[Banda music#Technobanda|Technobanda]] and [[Banda music#Tamborazo|Tamborazo]]. The instruments used from Tamborazo are the [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], and [[Bombo criollo#Tamboras|tambora]], while the instruments used from Technobanda are the [[electronic keyboard]] (specifically the [[Korg X3]], [[Korg N364/264|Korg N364]], which are used for the main melody and the [[Yamaha DX7]], which is used by many bands for the bass section), [[Drum kit|drum set]], and [[Singing|vocals]]. The electronic keyboard is emphasized in Duranguense, giving the genre its own signature riff.  In the mid to late 2000s, Duranguense was one of the most prevalent regional Mexican genres. Duranguense was further evolved with its own \"[[Music of Chicago|Chicago sound]]\" as Mexican American artists from the area incorporated different rhythms and styles into the genre.",
