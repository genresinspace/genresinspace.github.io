  "description": "'''Horror punk''' is a music genre that mixes [[punk rock]] and 1950s-influenced [[doo-wop]] and [[rockabilly]] sounds with morbid and violent imagery and lyrics which are often influenced by [[horror films]] and [[science fiction]] [[B-movies]]. The genre was pioneered by the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Subsequent bands formed in the Misfits' wake like [[Mourning Noise]], [[the Undead]] and [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]], solidifying horror punk's first wave. In the late 1990s and early 2000s the genre gained attention through the reunion of the Misfits and success of groups like [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Son of Sam (band)|Son of Sam]] and the [[Murderdolls]]. This popularity continued to the modern day with [[Blitzkid]], [[Calabrese (band)|Calabrese]] and [[Creeper (band)|Creeper]].",
