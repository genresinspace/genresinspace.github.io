  "description": "'''Horror punk''' is a music genre that mixes [[punk rock]] and 1950s-influenced [[doo-wop]] and [[rockabilly]] sounds with morbid and violent imagery and lyrics which are often influenced by [[horror films]] and [[science fiction]] [[B-movies]]. The genre was pioneered by the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] during the late 1970s to early 1980s, followed by bands such as [[Mourning Noise]], [[the Undead]] and [[Samhain (band)|Samhain]].  \n\nBy the late 1990s to early 2000s, the genre gained wider prominence through the Misfits' reunion tour, as well as the success of groups like [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Son of Sam (band)|Son of Sam]] and the [[Murderdolls]], which was then later proliferated by the formation of [[Blitzkid]], [[Calabrese (band)|Calabrese]] and [[Creeper (band)|Creeper]].",
