  "description": "'''British soul''', '''Brit soul''', or (in a US context) the '''British soul invasion''', is [[soul music]] performed by [[United Kingdom|British]] artists. Soul has been a major influence on [[British popular music]] since the 1960s, and [[United States|American]] soul was extremely popular among some youth subcultures, such as [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[skinhead]]s, and the [[Northern soul]] movement. In the 1970s, soul gained more mainstream popularity in the [[Music of the United Kingdom|UK]] during the [[disco]] era.\n\nHowever, a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s, when a number of [[Black British|black]] and [[White British|white]] artists who made soul their major focus, influenced by [[contemporary R&B]], began to enjoy some commercial success. British soul artists began gaining popularity in the United States in the late 2000s, resulting in another [[British Invasion]], this time a ''soul invasion'' (in contrast to the 1960s [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]], and 1980s [[Second British Invasion|new wave and synthpop invasions]]).",
