  "description": "'''Iso-Polyphony''' ({{Langx|sq|Iso-polifonia}}) is a traditional part of [[music of Albania|Albanian folk music]] and, as such, is included in [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list]]. Albanian Iso-Polyphony is considered to have its roots in the many-voiced ''[[vajtim]]'', the southern Albanian traditional lamentation of the dead. The instrumental expression of the Albanian Iso-Polyphony evolved into the Albanian ''[[Kaba (Albanian music)|kaba]]''.{{sfn|Tole|2022|pp=43–45}}\n\nAll four regions of southern Albania—Lalëria ([[Myzeqe]]), [[Toskeria|Toskëria]], [[Chameria|Çamëria]], and [[Labëria]]—have [[Polyphony#Balkan region|polyphonic song]] as part of their culture. A related form of polyphonic singing is found in northern [[Albania]], in the area of [[Peshkopi]]; [[Polog]], [[Tetovo]], [[Kičevo]] and [[Gostivar]] in [[North Macedonia]]; and [[Malësia]] in northern Albania and southern [[Montenegro]].\n\nLabëria is particular well known for multipart singing; songs can have two, three, or four parts. Two-part songs are sung only by women. Three-part songs can be sung by men and women. Four part songs are a Labërian specialty. Research has shown that four-part songs developed after three-part ones, and that they are the most complex form of polyphonic singing.\n\nThe [[Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival]], [[Albania]], ({{langx|sq|Festivali Folklorik Kombëtar}}), has been held every five years in the month of October since 1968, and it typically includes many polyphonic songs.",
