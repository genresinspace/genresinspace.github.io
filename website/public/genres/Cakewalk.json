  "description": "The '''cakewalk''' was a dance developed from the \"prize walks\" (dance contests with a cake awarded as the prize) held in the mid-19th century, generally at get-togethers of Black people on plantations before and after [[End of slavery in the United States of America|emancipation]] in the [[Southern United States]]. Alternative names for the original form of the dance were \"chalkline-walk\", and the \"walk-around\". It was originally a processional partner dance performed with comical formality.\n\nFollowing an exhibition of the cakewalk at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia, the cakewalk was adopted by performers in [[minstrel show]]s, where it was danced exclusively by men until the 1890s. At that point, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows featuring women began to include cakewalks, and [[grotesque dance]]s became very popular across the country. The fluid and graceful steps of the dance may have given rise to the colloquialism that something accomplished with ease is a \"cakewalk\".\n\nThe [[National Museum of American History]] points to the Grand March, a European style couples dance as the inspiration, noting that movements were creatively personalized with the inclusion of twists, shuffles and high kicks from African dances. Plantation owners would often welcome the contest and present the prize cake to the winner as a way to still exhibit authority.",
