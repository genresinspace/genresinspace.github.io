  "description": "The '''cakewalk''' was a dance developed from the \"prize walks\" (dance contests with a cake awarded as the prize) held in the mid-19th century, generally at get-togethers of Black people on plantations before and after [[End of slavery in the United States of America|emancipation]] in the [[Southern United States]]. Alternative names for the original form of the dance were \"chalkline-walk\", and the \"walk-around\". It was originally a processional partner dance performed with comical formality, and may have developed as a subtle mockery of the mannered dances of white slaveholders.\n\nFollowing an exhibition of the cakewalk at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia, the cakewalk was adopted by performers in [[minstrel show]]s, where it was danced exclusively by men until the 1890s. At that point, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows featuring women began to include cakewalks, and [[grotesque dance]]s became very popular across the country.\n\nThe fluid and graceful steps of the dance may have given rise to the colloquialism that something accomplished with ease is a \"cakewalk\".",
