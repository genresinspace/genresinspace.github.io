  "description": "The '''New Chilean Cumbia''' also known as '''New Chilean Cumbia Rock''' (Spanish: ''Nueva cumbia chilena'', ''Nueva cumbia rock chilena'') is a [[subgenre]] of [[cumbia music]] that originated in Chile in the early 2000s and that largely surfaced in mainstream media in 2009 and 2010. In contrast to older cumbias the lyrics of New Chilean Cumbia deals more with urban life and combines aspects of rock, [[hip hop]] and a wide variety of [[Latin American music|Latin American genres]] like [[Andean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], the son, [[reggae]], [[bolero]]s,  [[ska]], Latin-African music, [[diablada]] and even folklore from the Balkans, like the [[Klezmer]], and [[Gypsy style|Gipsy music]].\n\nWhile the movement has various influences its roots lie in the Chilean cumbia tradition established by [[Orquesta Huambaly]], [[Giolito y su Combo]], [[Orquesta Cubanacán]], [[Sonora Palacios|La Sonora Palacios]] and [[Sonora de Tommy Rey]], but in contrast to these bands the New Chilean Cumbia is aimed towards a younger public. The New Chilean Cumbia public comes often from the middle classes.\n\nThe movement has been contrasted to the heavily aired and commercialized ''Chilean Romantic Cumbia'' whose commercially most successful acts are [[La Noche]] and [[Américo]]. The New Chilean Cumbia is also distinct from the Argentine [[Cumbia Villera]] a genre that enjoys certain popularity in Chile and relies on synthesizers and focuses on marginal [[shanty town]] life.\n\nThe most popular New Chilean Cumbia acts include: [[Chico Trujillo]], [[Juana Fe]], [[La Mano Ajena]], [[Banda Conmoción]], Villa Cariño, [[Combo Ginebra]], La María Goyo (psychedelic cumbia), [[Sonora Barón]] and [[Santa Feria]].",
