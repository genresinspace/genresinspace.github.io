  "description": "'''Korean court music''' ({{Korean|hangul=궁중음악|hanja=宮中音樂}}) comprises three main musical genres: ''[[aak]]'', an imported form of Chinese ritual music; a pure Korean form called ''[[hyangak]]''; and a combination of Chinese and Korean styles called ''[[dangak]]''.\n\nKorean court music and its historical origins can be traced back to the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms Period]] (57 BCE–668), the [[Unified Silla]] (668–935), [[Goryeo]] (918–1392) and [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] dynasties (1392–1910). It was partly modelled on the court music of [[China]], known as ''[[yayue]]''. Korean court music also shows similarities with the court music of [[Japan]], known as ''[[gagaku]]'' and of [[Vietnam]], known as ''[[nhã nhạc]]'', which also are also derivative of yayue.\n\nPerformances in the form of banquet dances typically accompany the court music, in which musical institutions play a role in teaching and training musicians and performers on the forms of traditional Korean dance. The instruments used in Korean court music vary depending on the specific genre but do show various overlaps between the three different types. Traditional court music also continues to show significant cultural influence on contemporary society in [[South Korea]], through government, national music associations, and forms of popular culture such as [[Music of South Korea|South Korean music.]]",
