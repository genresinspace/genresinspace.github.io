  "description": "'''Garage punk''' is a [[rock music]] fusion genre combining the influences of [[garage rock]], [[punk rock]], and often other genres; the genre took shape in the [[indie rock]] underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bands drew heavily from 1960s garage rock, stripped-down 1970s punk rock,{{sfn|Markesich|2012|p=43}} and Detroit [[proto-punk]]; it also often incorporated numerous other styles into their approach, such as [[power pop]], 1960s [[girl group]]s, [[hardcore punk]], [[blues]], early [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[surf rock]].{{verification needed |date=February 2017}}\n\nThe term \"garage punk\" often also refers to the original 1960s [[garage rock]] movement rather than the 1980s-90s fusion style. The 1980s-90s style itself is sometimes referred to interchangeably as \"garage rock\" or \"[[garage revival]]\". The term \"garage punk\" dates back as early as 1972 in reference to the original 1960s garage rock style,{{sfn|Nobles|2012|p=32}} although \"punk\" as it is known today was not solidified as its own distinct genre until 1976.{{sfn|Austen|2005|p=168}} After the 1980s, groups who were labelled as \"garage punk\" stood in contrast to the nascent retro garage revival scene, moving past a strictly mid 1960s influence.{{sfn|Markesich|2012|p=43}} Associated bands from that period contributed to the development of [[stoner rock]], a more psychedelic variation of the genre."
