  "description": "'''Chutney music''' ([[Caribbean Hindustani]]:  चटनी संगीत, 𑂒𑂗𑂢𑂲 𑂮𑂑𑂹𑂏𑂲𑂞, چٹنی موسیقی) is a genre that blends [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] [[Indian folk music|folk music]], including [[Bhojpuri music|Bhojpuri]] folk traditions, with [[Caribbean]] [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[Soca music|soca]] rhythms and later [[filmi]] music. Originating in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] by [[Indo–Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Indo-Trinidadians]] in the mid-20th century, chutney music has reflected the history and experiences of [[Indian indenture system|indentured laborers]] hailing from the [[Indian subcontinent]], particularly from present-day states like [[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bengal]], and their descendants. It is similar to [[Baithak Gana]] that originated in the [[South America|South American]] nation of [[Suriname]].\n\nThe term ''chutney'' is derived from the [[Hindi]] word ''[[Chutney|chatni]],'' referring to [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] condiments made of spices. Before the emergence of Caribbean Hindustani, early chutney music often featured lyrics sung in Hindi, [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]],  [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] or other [[Indian languages (Indic)|Indian languages]], blended in with [[Languages of the Caribbean#Creole languages|West Indian Creole]] and [[Caribbean English]].\n\nThis genre is characterized by fast-paced rhythms and percussive beats, often accompanied by instruments such as the [[dholak]] (hand drum), [[harmonium]], and [[dhantal]] (metal rod percussion). Over time, chutney music has incorporated influences from [[Hindi film music|Bollywood music]], [[reggae]], [[hip-hop]], and [[Electronic Beats|<u>electronic beats</u>]].",
