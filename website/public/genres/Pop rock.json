  "description": "'''Pop rock''' (also typeset as '''pop/rock''') is a [[fusion genre]] and form of rock music characterized by a strong commercial appeal, with more emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude than standard [[rock music]]. Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal [[rock and roll]], early pop rock was influenced by the [[Beat (music)|beat]], arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and sometimes [[doo-wop]]).  It may be viewed as a distinct genre field rather than music that overlaps with [[Pop music|pop]] and rock.  The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less [[Authenticity in art#Authenticity of performance|authentic]] than rock music.",
