  "description": "'''Pop rock''' (also typeset as '''pop/rock''') is a [[music genre]] and form of [[rock music]] characterized by a strong commercial appeal, with more emphasis on professional [[songwriting]] and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude than standard rock music. Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal [[rock and roll]], early pop rock was influenced by the [[Beat (music)|beat]], arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and sometimes [[doo-wop]]). Pop rock may be viewed as a continuous genre field rather than separate categories. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less [[Authenticity in art#Authenticity of performance|authentic]] than rock music.",
