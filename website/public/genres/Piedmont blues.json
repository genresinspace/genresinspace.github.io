  "description": "'''Piedmont blues''' (also known as '''East Coast''', or '''Southeastern blues''') refers primarily to a guitar style, which is characterized by a fingerpicking approach in which a regular, alternating thumb [[bassline|bass]] string rhythmic pattern supports a syncopated [[melody]] using the [[Treble clef|treble]] strings generally picked with the fore-finger, occasionally others. The result is comparable in sound to [[ragtime]] or [[stride piano]] styles. Blues researcher [[Peter B. Lowry]] coined the term, giving co-credit to fellow [[folklorist]] [[Bruce Bastin]]. The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles, particularly the Mississippi [[Delta blues]], by its ragtime-based rhythms.",
