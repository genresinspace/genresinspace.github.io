  "description": "'''Folk jazz''' is a musical style that combines traditional [[folk music]] with elements of [[jazz]], usually featuring richly texturized songs. Its origins can be traced back to the 1950s, when artists like [[Jimmy Giuffre]] and [[Tony Scott (musician)|Tony Scott]] pursued distinct approaches to folk music production, initially, as a vehicle for soloist expression. Many already popular musical styles diversified as counter-culture bands embraced experimentation and inclusiveness in their works.\n\n\"[[Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]\" from [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1966 double album ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' blends various [[Americana (music)|Americana]] traditions with a jazzy rhythm. In 1968, [[Van Morrison]] released the influential ''[[Astral Weeks]]'', a mixture of folk, jazz, blues, soul and classical music. In 1969, [[Tim Buckley]] released ''[[Happy Sad (album)|Happy Sad]]'', an album in which he hinted at his early jazz influences{{snd}}most notably [[Miles Davis]]{{snd}}by infusing his folk-based songs with a non-traditional jazz timbre. [[Joni Mitchell]] released three albums in a folk-jazz hybrid style between 1975 and 1977, beginning with ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]''.",
