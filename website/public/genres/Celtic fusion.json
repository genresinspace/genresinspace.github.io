  "description": "'''Celtic fusion''' is an umbrella term for any modern music style which incorporates influences from [[Celtic music]] or from [[Modern Celts|Celtic people]]. \n\nIt is a syncretic musical tradition which borrows freely from the musical traditions of all the [[Celtic nations]] and the Celtic [[diaspora]], as well as from all styles of popular music, it is thus sometimes associated with the [[Pan-Celticism|Pan-Celtic]] movement. While Celtic fusion may include authentic music from any Celtic nation, it may also feature non traditional or non-Celtic music which has been influenced by the common characteristic of Celtic identity.",
