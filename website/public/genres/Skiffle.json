  "description": "'''Skiffle''' is a [[music genre|genre of folk music]] with influences from [[American folk music]], [[blues]], [[Country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[jazz]], generally performed with a mixture of manufactured and homemade or improvised instruments. \n\nOriginating as a form in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became extremely popular in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, where it was played by such artists as [[Lonnie Donegan]], [[the Vipers Skiffle Group]], [[Ken Colyer]], and [[Chas McDevitt]]. \n\nSkiffle was a major part of the early careers of some musicians who later became prominent in other genres, including [[the Quarrymen]] (who were later renamed [[the Beatles]]), [[Tony Sheridan]], and [[Rory Gallagher]]. The skiffle style has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the [[British folk revival#Second revival 1945–69|second British folk revival]], the [[British blues boom]], and the [[British Invasion]] of American popular music.",
