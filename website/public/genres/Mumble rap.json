  "description": "'''Mumble rap''' (sometimes referred to as '''SoundCloud rap''' or '''non-lyrical rap''') is a loosely defined [[microgenre]] of [[Hip-hop|hip hop]] that largely spread via the online audio distribution platform [[SoundCloud]] in the 2010s. The term implies \"mumbling\", or unclear or incoherent vocal delivery used by artists, and it has been used to describe rappers who do not share the rap genre's traditional emphasis on meaningful [[lyricism]], choosing instead to emphasize other aspects of delivery like melody, mood, and tone.\n\nWhile \"mumble rap\" originated as derogatory term, some have [[Reappropriation|reappropriated]] the label, with various critics and artists defending the style as a new phase in the evolution of hip hop."
