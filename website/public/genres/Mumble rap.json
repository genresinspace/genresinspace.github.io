  "description": "'''Mumble rap''' (also known as '''non-lyrical rap''') is a loosely defined style and era of [[hip-hop]] that emerged and proliferated via the online audio distribution platform [[SoundCloud]] during the mid-to-late 2010s. The term originated as a pejorative used to describe a vocal style characterized by unclear or incoherent enunciation, often described as \"mumbling\", which represented a shift away from traditional hip-hop conventions centered around complex or meaningful [[lyricism]], and instead emphasizing other aspects of delivery like melody, mood, and tone. \n\nWhile \"mumble rap\" originated as a pejorative, some have [[Reappropriation|reappropriated]] the label, with various critics and artists defending the style as a new phase in the evolution of hip-hop.",
