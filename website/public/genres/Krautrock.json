  "description": "'''Krautrock''' (also called '''{{not a typo|kosmische Musik}}''', German for {{noitalic|\"cosmic music\"}}{{sfn|Unterberger|1998|p= 174}}) is a broad [[music genre|genre]] of [[experimental rock]] that developed in [[West Germany]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It originated in the [[Berlin School of electronic music]] and among artists who blended elements of [[psychedelic rock]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] composition, and [[electronic music]], among other eclectic sources. Common elements included hypnotic rhythms, extended [[musical improvisation|improvisation]], [[musique concrète]] techniques, and early [[synthesizer]]s, while the music generally moved away from the [[rhythm & blues]] roots and [[song structure]] found in traditional Anglo-American [[rock music]]. Prominent groups associated with the krautrock label included [[Neu!]], [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Faust (band)|Faust]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], [[Ash Ra Tempel]], [[Popol Vuh (band)|Popol Vuh]], [[Amon Düül II]] and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]].\n\nThe term \"krautrock\" was popularised by British music journalists as a humorous umbrella-label for the diverse German scene, and although many such artists disliked the term, it is no longer considered controversial by German artists in the 21st century. Despite this, English-language authors remain critical of it. The movement was partly born out of the radical [[German student movement|student protests of 1968]], as German youth rebelled against their country's legacy in [[World War II]] and sought a [[popular music]] distinct from traditional German music and American pop. The period contributed to the development of [[ambient music]] and [[techno]], and influenced subsequent genres such as [[post-punk]], [[new-age music]], and [[post-rock]].",
