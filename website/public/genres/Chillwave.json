  "description": "'''Chillwave''' (originally considered synonymous with '''[[glo-fi]]''' and '''[[hypnagogic pop]]''') is a music [[microgenre]] that emerged in the late 2000s. It is characterized by evoking the popular music of the late 1970s and early 1980s while engaging with notions of [[memory]] and [[nostalgia]]. Common features include a faded or dreamy [[retro]] [[pop music|pop]] sound, [[Escapism|escapist]] lyrics (frequent topics include the beach or summer), [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] or [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetics, mellow vocals, slow-to-moderate tempos, [[Effects unit|effects processing]] (especially [[reverb]]), and vintage [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nChillwave was one of the first music genres to develop primarily through the [[Internet]]. The term was coined in 2009 by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff to lampoon microgenres and indie acts whose sounds resembled [[incidental music]] from 1980s [[VHS]] tapes. Prior to this, the music would have been labelled as [[shoegaze]], [[dream pop]], [[ambient music|ambient]], or [[indietronica]]. Leading acts included [[Neon Indian]], [[Washed Out]], and [[Toro y Moi]], who gained attention during 2009's \"Summer of Chillwave\". Washed Out's 2009 track \"[[Feel It All Around]]\" remains the best-known chillwave song.\n\nMany artists exploited the style's low-budget simplicity, which led to an oversaturation of acts that contributed to the original scene's demise. The phrase \"chillwave\" came to be used as a [[pejorative]] due to the music's perceived shallowness and reliance on nostalgia. Detractors also criticized the term for having been contrived by media publications. It heralded the early 2010s proliferation of Internet music microgenres, including [[vaporwave]], which originated as an ironic variant of chillwave. By the mid-2010s, chillwave had faded in popularity, with most of the original artists and listeners of the genre shifting focus to other music styles.",
