  "description": "'''Psychobilly''' (also known as '''punkabilly''') is a [[rock music]] fusion genre that fuses elements of [[rockabilly]] and [[punk rock]]. It has been defined as \"loud frantic rockabilly music\", it has also been said that it \"takes the traditional [[country rock|countrified rock]] style known as rockabilly, ramp[ing] up its speed to a sweaty pace, and combin[ing] it with punk rock and imagery lifted from [[horror film]]s and late-night [[sci-fi]] schlock,... [creating a] gritty [[honky tonk]] punk rock.\"\n\nPsychobilly is often characterized by lyrical references to science fiction, horror (leading to lyrical similarities to [[horror punk]]) and [[exploitation films]], [[violence]], lurid [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and other topics generally considered [[taboo]], though often presented in a comedic or [[tongue-in-cheek]] fashion. Psychobilly bands and lyrics usually take an [[politics|apolitical]] stance, a reaction to the right- and [[left wing]] political attitudes which divided other British [[youth culture]]s. It is often played with an upright [[double bass]], instead of the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] which is more common in modern rock music, and the [[hollowbody electric guitar]], rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock. Many psychobilly bands are [[power trio|trios]] of electric guitar, [[double bass | upright bass]] and drums, with one of the instrumentalists doubling as vocalist.\n\nPsychobilly has its origins in [[New York City|New York City's]] 1970s punk underground, in which [[the Cramps]] are widely given credit for being progenitors of the genre and the first psychobilly band to gain a following. The music gained popularity in [[Europe]] in the early 1980s, with the UK band [[The Meteors]], but remained underground in the United States until the late 1990s. The second wave of psychobilly began with the 1986 release of British band [[Demented Are Go]]'s debut album ''[[In Sickness & In Health]]''. The genre soon spread throughout [[Europe]], inspiring a number of new acts such as [[Mad Sin]] (formed in Germany in 1987) and the [[Nekromantix]] (formed in [[Denmark]] in 1989), who released the album ''[[Curse of the Coffin]]'' in 1991. Since then the advent of several notable psychobilly bands, such as the U.S. band [[Tiger Army]] and the Australian band [[The Living End]], has led to its mainstream popularity and attracted international attention to the genre.",
