  "description": "'''Chicago soul''' is a style of [[soul music]] that arose during the 1960s in [[Chicago]].  Along with [[Detroit]], the home of [[Motown]], and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], with its hard-edged, gritty performers (see [[Memphis soul]]), Chicago and the Chicago soul style helped spur the album-oriented soul revolution of the early 1970s.\n\nThe sound of Chicago soul, like [[southern soul]] with its rich influence of black [[gospel music]], also exhibited an unmistakable gospel sound, but was somewhat lighter and more delicate in its approach. Chicago [[vocal group]]s tended to feature laid-back sweet harmonies, while solo artists exhibited a highly melodic and somewhat [[pop music|pop]] approach to their songs.\n\nAccompaniment usually featured highly [[orchestra]]ted arrangements, with horns and strings, by such notable arrangers as [[Johnny Pate]] (who largely worked with horns) and Riley Hampton (who specialized in strings). This kind of soul music is sometimes called \"soft soul\", to distinguish it from the more harsh and gospel-like \"hard soul\" style."
