  "description": "'''Acid house''' (also simply known as just \"'''[[acid (electronic music)|acid]]'''\") is a subgenre of [[house music]] developed around the mid-1980s by [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s from [[Chicago]]. The style is defined primarily by the squelching sounds and [[bassline]]s of the [[Roland TB-303]] electronic bass synthesizer-sequencer, an innovation attributed to Chicago artists [[Phuture]] and [[Derrick Harris (musician)|Sleezy D]] circa 1986.\n \nAcid house soon became popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[continental Europe]], where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later [[rave]] scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[dance music|dance]] styles.\n\nAcid house brought house music to a worldwide audience. The influence of acid house can be heard in later styles of dance music including [[Trance music|trance]], [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[jungle music|jungle]], [[big beat]], [[techno]] and [[trip hop]].",
