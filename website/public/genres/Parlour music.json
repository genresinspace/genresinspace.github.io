  "description": "'''Parlour music''' (or '''parlor music''') is a type of [[popular music]] which, as the name suggests, is intended to be performed in the [[parlour]]s of houses, usually by amateur singers and [[piano|pianists]]. Disseminated as [[sheet music]], its heyday came in the 19th century, as a result of a steady increase in the number of households with enough resources to purchase musical instruments and instruction in music, and with the leisure time and cultural motivation to engage in recreational music-making. Its popularity faded in the 20th century as the [[phonograph]] record and radio replaced sheet music as the most common means for the spread of popular music.",
