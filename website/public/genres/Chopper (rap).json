  "description": "'''Chopper''' is a [[hip hop music]] subgenre that originated in the [[Midwestern United States]] and features fast-paced rhyming or rapping. Those that rap in the style are known as '''choppers''', and rapping in the style is sometimes referred to as '''chopping'''. The style is one of the major forms of Midwest hip hop, though by the early 2000s, it had spread to other parts of the United States including California and New York City, and it has spread around the world since.\n\nChopper style places an emphasis on speed of pronunciation, and as such is commonly attributed to some of the fastest professional rappers, such as [[Bone Thugs-N-Harmony]], [[Mac Lethal]], [[Twista]], [[Big L]], [[Tech N9ne]], [[Twisted Insane]], [[Busta Rhymes]], Rebel XD, [[Krizz Kaliko]], [[George Watsky]], [[Jaz-O]], Crucified830 and [[Eminem]]. Vocalist Oli Peters of the [[tech-death]] band [[Archspire]] is also heavily influenced by this style.",
