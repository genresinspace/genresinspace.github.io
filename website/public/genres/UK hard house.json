  "description": "'''UK hard house''' or simply '''hard house''' is a style of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in the early 1990s and is synonymous with its association to the [[Trade (nightclub)|Trade]] club and the associated DJs there that created the style. It often features a speedy [[tempo]] (around 150 BPM but hard house ranges from around 135 BPM to around 165 BPM), offbeat bass stabs, [[Hoover sound|hoovers]] and horns. It usually contains a break in the middle of the track where no drums are present. UK hard house often uses a long and sharp string note to create suspense. Most of the time, the drops are introduced by a [[drum roll]].",
