The genre is generally characterized by a standard 128 bpm, although in some cases up to 150 bpm. The term has been used to describe the 2012 to 2016 music of some DJ/producers, including [[Deorro]], [[Joel Fletcher]], [[Will Sparks]], [[Vinai]], and [[TJR (DJ)|TJR]].

It often features a repetitive beat structure with some amount of build-ups and mild drops throughout.

In 2014, productions of [[Joel Fletcher]], [[Will Sparks]], and Uberjak'd were playing both domestically and internationally, and influencing the EDM style of [[Steve Aoki]], [[TJR (DJ)|TJR]], and more.",
