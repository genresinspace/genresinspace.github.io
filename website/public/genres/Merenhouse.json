  "description": "'''Merenhouse''', '''Merenrap''' or '''Electronic merengue''', '''Mambo/Mambo de Calle''' is a style of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Merengue music]] derived by blending it with [[dancehall]], [[hip hop]] and [[house music|house]], particularly [[latin house]]. The mix of Latin, house and dancehall music started in New York City in the late 1980s.\n\nMerenhouse usually combines rap singing (talk-singing) with actual singing. It has instruments that are typically in Merengue music, such as saxophones, trumpets, [[accordion]]s, bass, guitar, [[g√ºira]], and [[Tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]], a kind of drum. However, it can be combined with electronic sounds or even electronic sounds sampled from the actual instruments (much like house music). [[Sampling (music)|Sampling]] music consists of reusing a sample or portion of a sound recording in a song. Merenhouse is very upbeat and intended for dancing, similar to house music; it is hard to identify merenhouse basing only on its [[time signature]] and its [[rhythm]] alone: some of them are in a fast 2/4 beat and has typical Merengue rhythms, while some other are in a slower 4/4 beat, identifying more with the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] style. Merenhouse can be characterized mostly by the using of instruments/electronics and the combination of vocal styles."
