It is a blend of [[Music of Colombia#Caribbean Region of Colombia|traditional musical forms]] of the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]], mainly [[vallenato]], with foreign Latin genres such as [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[Merengue music|merengue]], and pop and [[pop rock]]. The term \"tropipop\" comes from the [[portmanteau]] of the words \"[[Tropical music|tropical]]\" and \"pop music\" describing the genre's mix of Latin tropical roots with [[American popular music]].\n\nSome popular tropipop acts are [[Fanny Lu]], [[Fonseca (singer)|Fonseca]], [[Bonka (band)|Bonka]], [[Mauricio & Palodeagua]], [[Lucas Arnau]] and the internationally successful [[Carlos Vives]].",
