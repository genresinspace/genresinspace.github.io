  "description": "'''Old-school hip hop''' (also spelled '''old skool''') (originally '''disco-rap''') is the earliest commercially recorded [[Hip-hop|hip hop music]] and the original style of the genre. It typically refers to the music created around 1979 to 1983, as well as any hip hop that does not adhere to contemporary styles.\n\nThe image, styles and sounds of old-school hip hop were exemplified by figures like [[Disco King Mario]], [[DJ Hollywood]], [[Grandmaster Flowers]], [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]], [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Treacherous Three]], [[Funky 4 + 1|Funky Four Plus One]], [[Kurtis Blow]], [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Melle Mel]], Super-Wolf, [[West Street Mob]], [[Spoonie Gee]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[Busy Bee Starski]], [[Lovebug Starski]], [[The Cold Crush Brothers]], [[Warp 9]], [[T-Ski Valley]], [[Grandmaster Caz]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[The Sequence]], [[Jazzy Jay]], [[Crash Crew]], [[Rock Steady Crew]], and [[Fab Five Freddy]].\n\nIt is characterized by the more straightforward [[rapping]] techniques of the time and the general focus on party-related subject matter. The lyrics were usually not a very important part of old-school rap songs, but always included shoutouts to the artist's native New York City borough. Rap also emphasized the fashion of the time, whether it be Adidas, Kangol, Lee jeans, or the popular \"Sheep dog\" coats. However, there were some songs, such as Brother D's \"[[How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?]]\" and Kurtis Blow's \"Hard Times\" (both released in 1980), that explored socially relevant ideas. The release of \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" in 1982, written by [[Duke Bootee]] and [[Melle Mel]] and credited to [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five]], marked the arrival of [[Political hip-hop|hip hop as social commentary]], making it possible for future artists like [[Public Enemy]] and [[N.W.A]] to create an identity based on socially conscious themes in later years. Fun rhymes, like the \"Birthday Song\" and \"Thatâ€™s the Joint\" rocked the airwaves. Old-school rappers are widely respected by current hip hop artists and fans, with many claiming they have contributed to the evolution of hip hop.",
