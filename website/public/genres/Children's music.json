  "description": "'''Children's music''' or '''kids' music''' is music composed and performed for children. In European-influenced contexts this means music, usually songs, written specifically for a juvenile audience. The composers are usually adults. Children's music has historically held both entertainment and educational functions. Children's music is often designed to provide an entertaining means of teaching children about their [[culture]], other cultures, good behavior, facts and skills. Many are [[folk song]]s, but there is a whole genre of [[educational music]] that has become increasingly popular.",
