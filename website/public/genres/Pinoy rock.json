  "description": "'''Pinoy rock''', or '''Filipino rock''', is the brand of [[rock music]] produced in the [[Philippines]] or by [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. It has become as diverse as the rock music genre itself, and bands adopting this style are now further classified under more specific genres or combinations of genres like [[alternative rock]], [[post-grunge]], [[Ethnic music|ethnic]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[pop rock]], [[punk rock]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[ska]], and recently, [[Indie music|indie]]. Because these genres are generally considered to fall under the broad rock music category, Pinoy rock may be more specifically defined as rock music with Filipino cultural sensibilities."
