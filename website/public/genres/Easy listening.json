  "description": "'''Easy listening''' (including '''mood music''') is a [[popular music]] genre and radio format that was most popular during the 1950s to the 1970s. It is related to [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (MOR) music and encompasses [[instrumental]] recordings of [[Standard (music)|standards]], [[hit song]]s, non-[[Rock music|rock]] vocals and instrumental covers of selected popular rock songs. It mostly concentrates on music that pre-dates the [[rock and roll]] era, characteristically on music from the 1940s and 1950s. It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental [[beautiful music]] format by its variety of styles, including a percentage of vocals, [[arrangement]]s and [[tempo]]s to fit various parts of the broadcast day.\n\nEasy listening music is often confused with [[lounge music]], but while it was popular in some of the same venues it was meant to be listened to for enjoyment rather than as background sound.",
