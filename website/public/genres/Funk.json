  "description": "'''Funk''' is a [[music genre]] that originated in [[African-American]] communities in the mid-1960s when musicians created a [[rhythm]]ic, [[dance]]able new form of music through a mixture of various music genres that were popular among African-Americans in the mid-20th century. It deemphasizes [[melody]] and [[chord progressions]] and focuses on a strong rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]] of a [[bassline]] played by an [[electric bass]]ist and a drum part played by a [[drum kit|percussionist]], often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with [[Rhythm section|rhythm instruments]] playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel. It uses the same richly colored [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as [[minor chord]]s with added sevenths and elevenths, and [[dominant seventh]] chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.\n\nFunk originated in the mid-1960s, with [[James Brown]]'s development of a signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]â€”with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every [[Bar (music)|measure]] (\"The One\"), and the application of swung [[16th note]]s  and [[syncopation]] on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs. Rock- and [[psychedelia]]-influenced musicians [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s. Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Ohio Players]], [[Fatback Band]], [[Jimmy Castor]] Bunch, [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[B.T. Express]], [[Shalamar]], One Way, [[Lakeside (band)|Lakeside]], [[Dazz Band]], [[The Gap Band]], [[Slave (band)|Slave]], [[Aurra]], [[Roger Troutman]] & [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], [[Con Funk Shun]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], [[Bar-Kays]], [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. \n\nFunk derivatives include [[avant-funk]], an [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] strain of funk; [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], a hybrid of electronic music and funk; [[funk metal]]; [[G-funk]], a mix of [[gangsta rap]] and [[psychedelic funk]]; [[Timba]], a form of funky Cuban dance music; and funk jam. It is also the main influence of Washington [[go-go]], a funk subgenre. Funk [[sampling (music)|samples]] and [[breakbeat]]s have been used extensively in [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music]].",
