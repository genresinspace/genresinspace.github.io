It has been heavily influenced by styles such as [[house music|house]], [[drum and bass]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[techno]], [[acid jazz]], and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The eclectic style generally avoided rigid [[four-on-the-floor]] rhythms and could make use of samplers, analogue synths, and live instrumentation."
