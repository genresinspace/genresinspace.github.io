  "description": "'''Hardvapour''' is an Internet-based [[microgenre]] of music that emerged in late 2015 as a tongue-in-cheek response to [[vaporwave]], departing from the calm, [[muzak]]-sampling capitalist utopia concept of the latter in favor of a [[gabber]]- and [[Punk rock|punk]]-influenced sound. Canadian [[Record producer|music producer]] Wolfenstein OS X album ''End of World Rave'' (2015) and the Antifur [[record label]] are credited with having first defined the hardvapour sound.",
