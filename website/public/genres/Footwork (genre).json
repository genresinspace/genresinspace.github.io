  "description": "'''Footwork''', also called '''juke''', or '''Chicago juke''', is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] derived from [[ghetto house]] with elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], first appearing in [[Chicago]] in the late 1990s. The music style evolved from the earlier, rapid rhythms of [[ghetto house]], a change pioneered by [[RP Boo]], [[DJ Rashad]] and DJ Clent. It may draw from the rapid rhythms and sub-bass frequencies of [[drum & bass]]. Tracks also frequently feature heavily syncopated [[sample (music)|samples]] from [[rap music|rap]], [[pop music|pop]] and other sources, and are often around 160 bpm. The term '''juke music''' may be used as a synonym for '''footwork music''', or may be used to differentiate between footwork the closely related ''proper juke'' music born in the 1990s from ghetto house together with footwork music, and somewhat predating it.\n\n'''Footwork''' is also a style of [[house dance]], closely associated with juke and footwork music{{citesource|date=August 2024}}, and typified by very fast and chaotic feet moves.",
