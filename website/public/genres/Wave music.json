It is characterized by [[ambient music|atmospheric]] [[Melody|melodies]] and [[harmonies]], melodic and heavy bass such as [[reese bass|reese]], modern [[Trap music|trap]] drums, [[chopped and screwed|chopped]] vocal [[sample (music)|samples]] processed with [[reverb]] and [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], and [[arpeggiator]]s. Visually, it incorporates [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[computer animation|animation]], and imagery from [[video game]]s and [[cartoon]]s.\n\nWave music originated on online music platforms from a small group of [[DIY]] artists. Since then, wave music uploaded to streaming platforms such as [[YouTube]] has gathered millions of plays, which is partially attributable to the genre's broad influences. Since 2016, the wave scene has experienced an increase in physical events. From 2017 onward, the genre further incorporated elements of [[trance music|trance]] and [[hardstyle]], leading to the emergence of the [[#History|hardwave]] subgenre.",
