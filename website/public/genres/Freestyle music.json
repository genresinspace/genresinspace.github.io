  "description": "'''Freestyle music''', also known as '''Freestyle''', '''Latin freestyle''' or '''Latin hip-hop''', and sometimes '''Latin Rap''' is a form of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in the [[New York metropolitan area]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Miami]], primarily among [[Black Americans]], [[Hispanic Americans]] and [[Italian Americans]]. \n\nAn important precursor to freestyle is 1982's \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" by [[Afrika Bambaataa]] & [[Soul Sonic Force]]. [[Shannon (American singer)|Shannon]]'s 1983 hit \"[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]\" is often considered the first freestyle song and the first major song recorded by a [[Latin American]] artist is \"[[Please Don't Go (Nayobe song)|Please Don't Go]]\" by [[Nayobe]] from 1984.  From there, freestyle gained a large presence in American clubs, especially in New York and Miami.  Radio airplay followed in the mid-1980s.\n\nPerformers such as [[Exposé (group)|Exposé]], [[Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam]], [[Stevie B]] and [[Sweet Sensation (trio)|Sweet Sensation]] gained mainstream chart success with the genre in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but its popularity largely faded by the end of the decade.  Both classic and newer freestyle output remain popular as a niche genre in Brazil (where it is an influence on ''[[funk carioca]]''), Germany and Canada.",
