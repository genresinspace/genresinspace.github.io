  "description": "'''Mahragan''' or '''Mahraganat''' ({{langx|arz|مهرجانات}},&nbsp;{{IPA|arz|mɑhɾɑɡɑˈnɑːt|pron}}; {{translation|\"festivals, carnivals\"}}), also '''Egyptian electro''', '''Egyptian street music''' or '''shaabi-electro''',  is a popular genre of [[Egypt]]ian [[folk music]]. Mahraganat is a combination of working class popular Egyptian music ([[shaabi]]) played at weddings, [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], with heavy [[autotune]] use. DJ Figo made the genre more well known with his team \"set dyaba\"  released during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|2011 Egyptian Revolution]]. Although this may be the first ever track to go mainstream, Mahraganat was conceived early by several Egyptian underground artists as DJ Ahmed Figo, El Sadat, Feelo and Alaa Fifty in 2004. They shared their music via [[MP3]] files and phones, and it could be heard playing everywhere in [[taxi]]s, [[tuktuk]]s and on the street, since Egyptian Shaabi music has always been considered as the true soul of Egypt, given how powerful it is. Another Mahragan mix was released by the same group of friends in 2006 and it was called \"Mahragan Elsalam\", named after their neighbourhood 'Elsalam' in northeastern Cairo, it talked about friendship and how to be mature.",
