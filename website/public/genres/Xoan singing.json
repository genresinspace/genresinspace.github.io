  "description": "'''''Xoan'' singing''' or {{Language with name/for|vi|'''hát xoan'''|spring singing|paren=left}}, [[Chữ Nôm]]: {{lang|vi|咭春}}) is a genre of [[Music of Vietnam|Vietnamese]] [[folk music]] performed in [[Spring (season)#Vietnam|spring]] during the first two months of the [[Tết Nguyên Đán]] in [[Phú Thọ Province]]. The genre includes acting, ceremony, chant, dancing, drumming, and singing; with themes involve romance, riddles, and work. Traditionally occurring in [[temple]]s, [[shrine]]s, and communal homes, the songs are performed by a [[guild]], led by a {{lang|vi|trùm}}, consisting of male instrumentalists, or {{lang|vi|kép}}, and female singers, or {{lang|vi|đào}}. A guild consists of ten to fifteen performers, but there are few remaining, increasingly aging, guilds and teachers of this primarily [[oral tradition]].\n\nThere are three types of xoan singing: honoring [[Hùng king]]s and [[Thành hoàng]] (village guardian gods); wishing for good crops, health, and luck; and festive courtship songs alternating male and female voices. The [[texture (music)|texture]] is \"spare\"; [[perfect fourth]]s are prominent; and instruments include [[drum]]s and [[clapper (musical instrument)|clappers]].\n\n{{lang|vi|Hát}} is singing or acting and {{lang|vi|xoan}} derives from {{lang|vi|xuân}} ('spring'). In 2011, [[UNESCO]] inscribed {{lang|vi|Hát xoan}} in the [[List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding]]. In 2017, UNESCO removed {{lang|vi|xoan}} from that list and included it in the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].",
