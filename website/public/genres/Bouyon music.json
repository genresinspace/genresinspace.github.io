  "description": "'''Bouyon''' (pronunciation: ''boo-your'') is a genre of [[Music of Dominica|Dominican music]] that originated in [[Dominica]] in the late 1980s. Prominent bouyon groups include [[Windward Caribbean Kulture]] (WCK); Roots, Stems and Branches (RSB); and First Serenade.\n\n\"Hardcore bouyon\", also called \"Gwada-Bouyon,\" is another type of bouyon, different to the Dominican genre which began through musical collaborations between citizens of Dominica and Guadeloupe, who both speak [[Antillean Creole]]. The term ''bouyon'' means something akin to \"[[gumbo]] soup\" or \"coubouyon poisson\" (a typical Caribbean dish) in [[Antillean Creole]]. Bouyon music is a mix of traditional and modern music, and is popular across much of the Caribbean.",
