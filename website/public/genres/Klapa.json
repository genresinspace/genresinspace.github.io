  "description": "'''Klapa''' music is a form of traditional [[a cappella]] singing with origins in [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]]. The word ''klapa'' translates as \"a group of friends\" and traces its roots to littoral church singing. The motifs in general celebrate love, [[wine]] (grapes), country (homeland) and sea. Main elements of the music are harmony and melody, with rhythm very rarely being very important. In 2008, [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]] proclaimed it Croatian Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2012 klapa was inscribed in [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].",
