  "description": "'''Noise music''' is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of [[noise]]. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of [[music genre|musical styles]] and [[sound art|sound-based]] creative practices that feature noise as a primary [[aspect of music|aspect]].\n\nNoise music can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical [[Vocals#Vocal technique|vocal techniques]], physically manipulated audio media, [[Sound effect|processed sound]] recordings, [[field recording]], [[Computer music|computer-generated]] noise, [[stochastic process]], and other randomly produced electronic signals such as [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as [[improvisation]], [[extended technique]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]] and [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]]. In many instances, conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm or pulse is dispensed with.\n\nThe [[Futurism|Futurist]] art movement (with most notably [[Luigi Russolo]]'s [[Intonarumori]] and [[The Art of Noises|''L'Arte dei Rumori'' (''The Art of Noises'')]] manifesto) was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the [[Dada]] art movement (a prime example being the ''Antisymphony'' concert performed on April 30, 1919, in Berlin). In the 1920s, the French composer [[Edgard Varèse]], when [[New York Dada]] associated via [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]]'s magazine [[391 (magazine)|''391'']], conceived of the elements of his music in terms of [[Sound mass|sound-masses]]; writing in the first half of the 1920s, ''Offrandes'', ''Hyperprism'', ''[[Octandre]]'', and ''[[Intégrales]]''.{{sfn|Ouellette|1973|p=50}} Varèse thought that \"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]\", and he posed the question: \"What is music but organized noises?\"{{sfn|Varèse|1966|p=11–19}}\n\n[[Pierre Schaeffer]]'s ''[[musique concrète]]'' 1948 compositions ''[[Cinq études de bruits]]'' (''Five Noise Studies''), that began with {{Lang|fr|Etude aux Chemins de Fer}} (''Railway Study'') are key to this history. {{Lang|fr|Etude aux Chemins de Fer}} consisted of a set of recordings made at the train station Gare des Batignolles in Paris that included six steam locomotives whistling and trains accelerating and moving over the tracks. The piece was derived entirely from recorded noise sounds that were not musical, thus a realization of Russolo's conviction that noise could be an acceptable source of music. ''[[Cinq études de bruits]]'' premiered via a radio broadcast on October 5, 1948, called {{Lang|fr|Concert de bruits}} (''Noise Concert'').\n\nLater in the 1960s, the [[Fluxus]] art movement played an important role, specifically the Fluxus artists [[Joe Jones (Fluxus artist)|Joe Jones]], [[Yasunao Tone]], [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Dieter Roth]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Ocean Music'', [[Milan Knížák]]'s ''Broken Music Composition'', early [[La Monte Young]], [[Takehisa Kosugi]], and the ''Analog #1 (Noise Study)'' (1961) by Fluxus-related composer [[James Tenney]].{{sfn|Kahn|2012|pp=131–146}}\n\nContemporary noise music is often associated with extreme volume and distortion. Notable genres that exploit such techniques include [[noise rock]] and [[no wave]], [[industrial music]], [[Japanoise]], and [[postdigital]] music such as [[glitch (music)|glitch]]. In the domain of [[experimental rock]], examples include [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' and [[Sonic Youth]]. Other notable examples of composers and bands that feature noise based materials include works by [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Helmut Lachenmann]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Glenn Branca]], [[Rhys Chatham]], [[Ryoji Ikeda]], [[Survival Research Laboratories]], [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]], [[Coil (band)|Coil]], [[Merzbow]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Psychic TV]], [[Jean Tinguely]]'s recordings of his [[sound sculpture]] (specifically ''Bascule VII''), the music of [[Hermann Nitsch]]'s ''Orgien Mysterien Theater'', and [[La Monte Young]]'s bowed gong works from the late 1960s."
