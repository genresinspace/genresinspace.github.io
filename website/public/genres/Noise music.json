  "description": "'''Noise music''' (also known as '''noise''') is a [[subgenre]] of [[experimental music]] that is characterised by its use of [[noise|unwanted noise]] as a primary [[aspect of music|musical element]]. The genre has roots in early 20th century [[avant-garde music]], but later drew influence from [[industrial music]]. It is characterized by a rejection of conventional [[music theory]] and traditional [[song structure|song structures]], often featuring little or no [[melody]], [[rhythm]], or [[harmony]]. This type of music tends to challenge the conventional distinction between musical and non-musical sound.\n\n\"Noise as music\" originated as an avant-garde music style in the 1910s through the work of [[Luigi Russolo]] an [[Italian Futurist]], who published the manifesto ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' in 1913''.'' Elements of noise music were later explored by artists in the [[Dada]] and [[Fluxus]] movements, as well as through [[electroacoustic music]], [[modern classical]] and [[musique concr√®te]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, the genre began to be practiced more by amateur musicians than academics. [[Lou Reed]]'s [[Metal Machine Music|''Metal Machine Music'']] became an influential work for later noise artists. However, compositions such as [[Robert Ashley]]'s \"The Wolfman\" (1964) and [[Pauline Oliveros]] \"A Little Noise In The System\" (1967) are among the earliest examples of contemporary noise music. \n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, the emergence of industrial music and commercial [[Synthesizer|synthesizers]], encouraged non-musicians to experiment with strictly noise-oriented styles, leading to genres such as [[Power electronics (music genre)|power electronics]], coined by English noise act [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]], as well as [[Post-Industrial (music genre)|post-industrial]] styles like [[dark ambient]], [[death industrial]] and [[power noise]]. In Japan, the [[Japanoise]] scene which stemmed out of the [[Kansai no wave]] movement, produced several influential noise acts such as [[Merzbow]], [[Hijokaidan]], [[Hanatarash]], [[C.C.C.C. (band)|C.C.C.C.]] and [[Incapacitants]], who, together with American and European noise artists [[the Haters]], [[Daniel Menche]], [[Vomir]] and [[Richard Ramirez (musician)|Richard Ramirez]], contributed to the emergence of [[harsh noise]] and [[harsh noise wall]] into the 1990s and 2000s.",
