  "description": "'''Bebop''' or '''bop''' is a style of [[jazz]] developed in the early to mid-1940s in the United States. The style features compositions characterized by a fast tempo (usually exceeding 200 bpm), complex [[chord progression]]s with rapid chord changes and numerous [[Modulation (music)|changes of key]], instrumental virtuosity, and [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]] based on a combination of [[harmonic structure]], the use of scales, and occasional references to the [[melody]].\n\nBebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented [[swing music]]-style to a new \"musician's music\" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening.  As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex [[syncopation]], [[altered chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used [[rhythm section]]s in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing music era was the [[big band]] of 16â€“18 musicians playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of [[saxophone]] (alto or tenor), [[trumpet]], [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[double bass]], and [[Drum kit|drums]] playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the \"head\") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.\n\nSome of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are [[alto sax]] player [[Charlie Parker]]; [[tenor sax]] players [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]; [[clarinet]] player [[Buddy DeFranco]]; trumpeters [[Fats Navarro]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]; pianists [[Bud Powell]], [[Barry Harris]] and [[Thelonious Monk]]; [[electric guitar|electric guitarist]] [[Charlie Christian]]; and drummers [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Art Blakey]].",
