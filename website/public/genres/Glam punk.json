  "description": "'''Glam punk''' is a music genre that began in the early to mid-1970s and incorporates elements of [[proto-punk]] and [[glam rock]]. The genre was pioneered by the [[New York Dolls]], who influenced the formation of other New York City groups [[the Stilettos]], [[the Brats (band)|the Brats]] and [[Ruby and the Rednecks]] and bands in the United Kingdom including [[Hollywood Brats]] and [[Jet (UK band)|Jet]]. These bands largely began the early punk rock scene. The impact of [[Hanoi Rocks]] brought about a revived interest in the sound during the 1980s, seeing a revival with groups including [[the Dogs D'Amour]] and [[Soho Roses]], and the pioneering of [[glam metal]]. Through the 1990s, some groups gained significant commercial success reviving the sound of glam punk, notably the [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[Backyard Babies]] and [[Turbonegro]].",
