  "description": "[[Rock music]] in [[Ireland]], also known as '''Irish rock''', has been a part of the [[music of Ireland]] since the 1960s, when the [[British Invasion]] brought [[British blues]], [[psychedelic rock]] and other styles to the island. The Irish music scene in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was dominated by the unique Irish phenomenon of the '[[Showbands]]' which were groups of professional performers who played at dancehalls and clubs across the country. They were putting on a professional 'show' and playing all the American and British hits of the era. From the mid-1970s onwards rock music in Ireland has followed a similar path to rock music in Britain.",
