It typically involves [[radio]]-friendly rock music that was designed to be played for large audiences.\n\nAs [[hard rock]] and [[pop rock]] became increasingly popular, groups began creating material inherently designed for performance to crowds and major concerts. Arena rock also developed from their use of more commercially oriented sounds that were intended for radio play. The highly produced music, including both upbeat, dramatic songs and slower [[power ballad]]s, features strong emphasis on [[melody]] and frequently employs [[anthem]]ic choruses. Other major characteristics include prominent [[Effects unit|guitar effects]] and the use of [[keyboard instrument]]s.{{sfn|Donaldson|2009|p=248}}{{sfn|Crystal|2014|p=220}} Typical themes of arena rock lyrics include love, heartbreak, angst, and sentimentality.\n\nMany of the above labels are used [[pejorative]]ly,{{sfn|Crystal|2014|p=220}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|pages=xviii, 54, 72–73, 82, 215}} and discussions over music criticism often delve into the question of whether musicians' focus on rock [[spectacle]] and mass appeal results in compromised artistic merit, particularly in terms of the difference between the interests of the \"[[middlebrow]]\" populace versus other listeners.{{sfn|McDonald|2009|pp=54–56, 62–65, 196–206}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|pages=xviii, 54, 72–73, 82, 215}} Interest in arena rock is stereotypically associated with [[working class|working-class]] to [[middle class|middle-class]] men living in either Canada or the United States (including so-called \"[[yuppie]]s\"),{{sfn|Donaldson|2009|p=248}} which has been cited as the basis for condescending prejudice over social status in some criticisms.{{sfn|McDonald|2009|pp=54–56, 62–65, 196–206}} However, the style of music has been highly successful worldwide, particularly in terms of touring.{{sfn|McDonald|2009|pp=54–56, 62–65, 196–206}}",
