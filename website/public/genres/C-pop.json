This also includes countries where [[Sinitic languages|Chinese languages]] are used by parts of the population, such as Singapore and Malaysia. C-pop is used as an umbrella term covering not only Chinese pop but also [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]], [[Chinese rock]], [[Chinese hip hop]] and Chinese ambient music, although Chinese rock diverged during the early 1990s. \n\nThere are currently three main subgenres within C-pop: [[Cantopop]], [[Mandopop]] and [[Hokkien pop]]. The gap between Cantopop and Mandopop has been narrowing in the new millennium. Hokkien pop, initially strongly influenced by Japanese [[enka]], has been re-integrating into C-pop and narrowing its trend of development towards Mandopop. {{citation needed|date=September 2021}}\n\nChinese popular music in China was initially a vehicle for the [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideologies; however, during the country's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, it has lost much political significance; and now closely resembles the styles of Taiwanese Mandopop, Cantopop, [[K-pop]] and [[J-pop]], from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Japan, respectively.
