  "description": "'''Electro-industrial''' is a [[music genre]] that emerged from [[industrial music]] in the early 1980s. While [[Electronic body music|EBM]] (electronic body music) has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial tends to have a grittier, complex and layered sound with a more experimental approach. The style was pioneered by [[Skinny Puppy]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Numb (band)|Numb]], and other groups, either from Canada or the [[Benelux]]. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the ''dark electro'' genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the ''aggrotech'' offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the [[rivethead]] subculture.",
