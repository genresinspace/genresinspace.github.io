  "description": "'''Jazz rap''' (also known as '''jazz hop''' or '''jazz hip hop''') is a fusion of [[jazz]] and [[Hip-hop|hip hop music]], as well as an [[alternative hip-hop]] subgenre, that developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [[AllMusic]] writes that the genre \"was an attempt to fuse [[African-American music]] of the past with a newly dominant form of the present, paying tribute to and reinvigorating the former while expanding the horizons of the latter.\" The rhythm was rooted in hip hop over which  repetitive phrases of jazz instrumentation, such as the trumpet, double bass, etc., were placed. The groups involved in the formation of jazz rap included [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Digable Planets]], [[De La Soul]], [[Gang Starr]], and [[Jungle Brothers]].",
