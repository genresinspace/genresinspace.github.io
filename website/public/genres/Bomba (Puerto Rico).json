  "description": "'''Bomba''' is an [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|umbrella term]] that refers to a variety of musical styles and associated dances originating in [[Puerto Rico]]. It was developed during the 17th century by [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] and their descendants on [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]] along coastal towns, most notably [[Loiza]], [[Mayagüez]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. It is the island's oldest musical tradition.\n\nBomba reflects a [[syncretism]] of Puerto Rico’s many cultural groups. It incorporates [[Taíno]] instruments such as [[maraca]]s; characteristics from traditional European dances like [[Rigaudon|rigadoons]], [[quadrille]]s and [[mazurka]]s; and drum ensembles and drummer–dancer interactions that bear close resemblance to a number of [[West Africa]]n musical styles. The music also evolved through contact between enslaved populations from different Caribbean colonies and regions, including the [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch colonies]], [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (Dominican Republic), and [[Saint-Domingue]] (Haiti), and it has notable roots in Congolose and Afro-French cultural expressions.\n\nAfter slavery was abolished, bomba was commercialized in the mid-20th century and incorporated into the island’s folklore. In the 1990s, the bomba and [[plena]] group Hermanos Emmanueli Náter brought the genre to the streets for public consumption in the form of \"Bombazos\" that were designed for communal participation.",
