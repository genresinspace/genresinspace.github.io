  "description": "'''Bomba''' is an [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|umbrella term]] that refers to a variety of [[musical style]]s and associated [[dance]]s originating in [[Puerto Rico]]. It was developed by [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Africans]] and their descendants in [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]] along coastal towns, most notably [[Loiza]], [[Mayagüez]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], during the 17th century. It is the island's oldest musical tradition.\n\nBomba reflects a [[syncretism]] of Puerto Rico’s many cultural groups. It incorporates [[Taíno]] instruments such as [[Maraca|the maraca]]; characteristics from traditional European dances like [[Rigaudon|rigadoons]], [[quadrille]]s and [[mazurka]]s; and drum ensembles and drummer/dancer interactions that bear close resemblance to a number of [[West Africa]]n musical styles. The music also evolved through contact between enslaved populations from different Caribbean colonies and regions, including the [[Dutch colonial empire|Dutch colonies]], [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]],  and [[Haiti]], and it has notable roots in Congolose and Afro-French cultural expressions.\n\nAfter slavery was abolished, Bomba was commercialized in the mid-20th century and incorporated into the island’s folklore. In the 90’s, the Bomba & Plena group Hermanos Emmanueli Náter brought the genre to the streets for public consumption in the form of “Bombazos” that were designed for communal participation.",
