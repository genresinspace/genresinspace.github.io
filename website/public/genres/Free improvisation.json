  "description": "'''Free improvisation''' (also known as '''free form music''' or '''free music''') is a form of [[Musical improvisation|improvised music]] centered on a commitment to non-[[Idiomatic (music)|idiomatic]] musical expression. It is inspired by [[free jazz]], [[serialism]] and [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]], and is characterized by a general rejection of formal [[music theory]] and [[tonality]], instead following the intuition of its performers. The term can refer to both a technique—employed by any musician in any genre—and as a recognizable genre of [[experimental music]] in its own right.\n\nFree improvisation, as a genre of music, developed primarily in the U.K. as well as the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of [[free jazz]] and [[contemporary classical music]]. Exponents of free improvised music include saxophonists [[Evan Parker]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Peter Brötzmann]], and [[John Zorn]], composer [[Pauline Oliveros]], trombonist [[George E. Lewis]], guitarists [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Fred Frith]], bassists [[Damon Smith]] and [[Jair-Rohm Parker Wells]] and the improvising groups [[Spontaneous Music Ensemble]] and [[AMM (group)|AMM]].",
