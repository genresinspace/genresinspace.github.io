  "description": "'''Exotica''' is a musical genre that was popular during the 1950s to mid-1960s with Americans who came of age during [[World War II]]. The term was coined by [[Simon Waronker|Simon \"Si\" Waronker]], [[Liberty Records]] co-founder and board chairman, named after the 1957 [[Martin Denny]] album [[Exotica (Martin Denny album)|''Exotica'']]. The musical colloquialism ''exotica'' means tropical [[ersatz good|ersatz]], the non-native, pseudo experience of insular [[Oceania]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Hawaii]], the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Andes]], the [[Caribbean]] and tribal [[Africa]]. Denny described the musical style as \"a combination of the South Pacific and the [[Orient]]...what a lot of people imagined the islands to be like...it's pure fantasy though.\" While the [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] forms the core region, exotica reflects the \"musical impressions\" of every place from standard travel destinations to the mythical \"[[Shangri-La|shangri-la]]s\" dreamt of by armchair [[safari]]-ers."
