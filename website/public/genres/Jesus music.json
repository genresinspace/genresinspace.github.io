  "description": "'''Jesus music''', known as '''gospel beat music''' in the United Kingdom, is a style of [[Christian music]] that originated on the [[West Coast of the United States]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This musical genre developed in parallel to the [[Jesus movement]] and became a defining part of the movement. It outlasted the movement that spawned it and the [[Christian music industry]] began to eclipse it and absorb its musicians around 1975.",
