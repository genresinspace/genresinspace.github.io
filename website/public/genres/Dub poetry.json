  "description": "'''Dub poetry''' is a form of [[performance poetry]] of [[Jamaica]]n origin, which evolved out of [[dub music]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], in the 1970s, as well as in [[London]], England, and [[Toronto]], Canada, cities which have large populations of [[Caribbean people|Caribbean]] immigrants.  The term \"Dub Poetry\" was coined by Dub artist [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] in 1976, and further popularized by artist [[Oku Onuora|Oku Onoura]], which consists of [[spoken word]] over reggae rhythms, originally found on the backing or \"version\" side of a 12 or 7 inch [[vinyl record]].\n\nUnlike [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]] (also known as toasting), which also features the use of the spoken word, the dub poet's performance is normally prepared, rather than the [[extemporized]] chat of the [[dancehall]] dee jay. In musical setting, the dub poet usually appears on stage with a band performing music specifically written to accompany each poem, rather than simply performing over the top of dub plates, or [[riddim]]s, in the dancehall fashion. [[Musicality]] is built into dub poems, yet dub poets generally perform without backing music, delivering chanted speech with pronounced rhythmic accentuation and dramatic stylization of gesture. Sometimes dub music effects such as echo and reverb are dubbed spontaneously by a poet into live versions of a poem. Many dub poets also employ [[call-and-response]] devices to engage audiences.",
