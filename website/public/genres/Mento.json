  "description": "'''Mento''' is a style of [[Music of Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[folk music]] that predates and has greatly influenced [[ska]] and [[reggae]] music. It is a fusion of African rhythmic elements and European elements, which reached peak popularity in the 1940s and 1950s. Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as [[classical guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], [[hand drum]]s, and the [[rhumba box]]â€”a large [[mbira]] in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the [[bass (sound)|bass]] part of the music.\n\nMento is often confused with [[Calypso music|calypso]], a musical form from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Although the two share many similarities, they are separate and distinct musical forms. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently [[metonym|referred]] to as ''calypso'', ''kalypso'' and ''mento calypso''. Mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques.  As in calypso, mento uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues. Sexual innuendo is also common.",
