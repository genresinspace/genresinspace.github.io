Singers of Raï are called {{lang|ar-Latn|cheb}} ({{Lang|ar|شاب}}) or {{lang|ar-Latn|cheba}} ({{lang|ar|شابة}}), i.e. 'young', as opposed to {{lang|ar-Latn|sheikh}} ({{Lang|ar|شيخ}}, '[[shaykh]]'), i.e. 'old', the name given to [[Chaabi (Algeria)|Chaabi]] singers. The tradition arose in the city of [[Oran]], primarily among the poor. Traditionally sung by men, by the end of the 20th century, female singers became common. The lyrics have concerned social issues such as disease and the policing of European colonies that affected native populations.",
