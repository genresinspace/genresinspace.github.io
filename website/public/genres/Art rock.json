  "description": "'''Art rock''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that generally reflects critically identified challenging approaches to rock, making use of [[modernist]], experimental, or unconventional elements. The concept of art rock precludes the aspiration to elevate rock from entertainment to an artistic statement,{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} with the term typically being applied in response to mainstream rock music. Influences that have been perceived in music described with the term, also found in [[progressive rock]], include [[art music]], [[experimental music]], [[avant-garde music]], [[classical music]], and [[jazz]].\n\nListening contemplatively rather than enjoyment as entertainment or [[dance music|dancing]] to music is the distinction often given by music critics and journalists who have applied the term.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of [[punk rock]] in the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=49}}  After, the genre was identified as occasionally being fused with later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}",
