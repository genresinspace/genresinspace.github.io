  "description": "'''Art rock''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[rock music]] that generally reflects a challenging or [[avant-garde]] approach to rock, or which makes use of [[modernist]], experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from entertainment to an artistic statement,{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from genres such as [[experimental music]], [[avant-garde music]], [[classical music]], and [[jazz]].\n\nArt rock was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for [[dance music|dancing]], and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and [[easy listening]] textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=393}} The term may sometimes be used interchangeably with \"[[progressive rock]]\", though the latter is instead characterised in particular by its employment of [[classically trained]] instrumental technique and [[symphonic]] textures.\n\nThe music, as well as the theatrical nature of performances associated with the genre, was able to appeal to artistically inclined adolescents and younger adults, especially due to its virtuosity and musical/lyrical complexity. Art rock is most associated with a certain period of rock music, beginning in 1966–67 and ending with the arrival of [[punk rock]] in the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=49}}  After, the genre would be infused within later popular music genres of the 1970s–90s.\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}",
