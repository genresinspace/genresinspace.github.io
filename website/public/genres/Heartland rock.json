  "description": "'''[[Heartland (United States)|Heartland]] rock''' is a genre of [[rock music]] characterized by a straightforward, often [[roots rock|roots]] musical style, often with a focus on [[blue-collar worker]]s, and a conviction that rock music has a social or communal purpose beyond just entertainment.\n\nThe genre is exemplified by singer-songwriters [[Tom Petty]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Michael Stanley]], and [[John Mellencamp]] and [[country music]] artists, including [[Steve Earle]] and [[Joe Ely]]. The genre developed in the 1970s and reached its commercial peak in the 1980s when it became one of the best-selling genres in the United States. In the 1990s, many established acts faded and the genre began to fragment, but the major figures have continued to record with commercial success.",
