  "description": "'''Levenslied''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally \"life song\" or \"song about life\") is a sentimental Dutch-language subgenre of [[popular music]]. ''Levenslied'' lyrics can be sweet or bitter, light and sentimental, but also reflective and dark, about subjects such as love, misery and far-away, sunny, exotic holiday places. The darker, more sentimental songs are also known as \"smartlap\" (\"sorrow bandage\", or tearjerker). The levenslied is related to the ''[[chanson]]'' though for a lower-class audience, like the [[Schlager music|schlager]].\n\nA typical levenslied has catchy, simple rhythms and melodies and is built up in [[couplets]] and refrains. Traditional musical instruments in levenslied music are the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]]. Modern levenslied artists also use [[synthesizer]]s and [[guitar]]s.\n\nThe songs are usually in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] but also [[English language|English]] or [[Italian language|Italian]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}\n\nThree cities in the Netherlands, [[Breda]], [[Tilburg]] and [[Nijmegen]], have annual Levenslied festivals.",
