  "description": "'''Gh hip hop''', '''Gh rap''' or '''Ghana hip hop''' is a hip hop genre, [[subculture]] and [[art movement]] that developed in Ghana during the late 1990s. The hip-hop genre came into existence in [[Ghana]] through [[Reggie Rockstone]], who is known as the hip-life father, and other notable musicians such as [[Jayso]] and [[Ball J]]. It first came to Ghana as Hiplife, where [[Reggie Rockstone]] introduced a fusion of hip-hop beats with African sounds to create a whole new genre.\n\n[[Hiplife]] is different from Western hip hop because it involves local dialects such as [[Twi]], Ga, [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Ghanaian Pidgin English]]. Some hip-hop musicians in the early era were Reggie Rockstone, [[Kae Sun]], [[Sway DeSafo]], [[Samini]], [[Okyeame Kwame]], Bradez, [[Buk Bak]], [[D-Black]], [[Sarkodie (rapper)|Sarkodie]], [[Tic (musician)|Tic Tac]], [[Obrafour]], [[4x4 (band)|4x4]], [[Kwaw Kese]], [[Ayigbe Edem]] and upcoming artists such as Lil Shaker, Bra Kevin, Rayoe, Yaa Pono, Loone, Asem, and [[EL (rapper)|EL]]. Some songs from this era of hip hop were Asabone, Eye Mo De Anaa, and you no get money."
