  "description": "'''Trallpunk''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]; roughly translates to 'melodious punk' — see [[wikt:trallpunk#Swedish|the Wiktionary entry]]) is a subgenre of [[punk rock|punk music]] developed in [[Sweden]].  It is known for its two-beat, fast drum tempos, a melodic sound with harmonized vocals, and politically oriented lyrics in Swedish. \nGenerally, trallpunk music advocates for left wing political causes.  [[Asta Kask]] is considered to be one of the first trallpunk bands. During the 1990s, trallpunk saw increased popularity, particularly due to the club [[Kafé 44]] in [[Stockholm]] and the band [[De Lyckliga Kompisarna]] (The Happy Friends).\n\nToday, trallpunk is represented through bands such as [[Varnagel]], [[Slutstation Tjernobyl]], [[Greta Kassler]], and [[De Lyckliga Kompisarna]]. Internationally, bands like [[Rasta Knast]] and [[Takahashi Gumi]] are examples.",
