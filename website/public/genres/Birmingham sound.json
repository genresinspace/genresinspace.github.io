  "description": "The '''Birmingham sound''' is a subgenre of [[techno]]  that emerged in [[Birmingham]], [[England]] in the early 1990s. It is most commonly associated with the city's House of God club night, the [[Downwards Records]] label, and the local DJs and producers [[Regis (musician)|Regis]], [[Surgeon (musician)|Surgeon]] and [[Female (musician)|Female]]. It is characterised by a hard, fast and uncompromising style that strips the music of the bassline funk that characterised the techno of Detroit and Berlin, leaving only \"huge slabs of unrelentingly unchanging minimalism\".\n\nThe Birmingham sound marked a turning point in the development of techno and its influence can be heard throughout the [[Berlin]] techno of the [[Berghain]] and [[Ostgut Ton]]. It also formed the starting point for Regis and Female's later [[Sandwell District]] project.",
