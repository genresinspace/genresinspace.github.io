  "description": "'''Indigenous metal''' is [[heavy metal music]] played by [[indigenous peoples]] of various colonized regions. Bands may play music from across the metal spectrum, though most center indigenous themes, stories, or instruments. Groups with indigenous members are sometimes considered to play indigenous metal regardless of the thematic content of their music.\n\nIndigenous metal entered American popular culture in the 1980s and early 1990s through the commercial success of songs like \"[[Indians (song)|Indians]]\" by [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Several Native-fronted bands, such as [[thrash metal]] group [[Testament (band)|Testament]], also began releasing music dealing with indigenous themes during this period. Brazilian band [[Sepultura]] helped pioneer the style through the 1996 release of ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', which was created in collaboration with members of a [[Xavante]] community and is noted for its distinct Brazilian percussion, ambient field noise, and chanting. A [[Karaj√°]] man features on the cover of the album.\n\n\"True\" native metal (heavy metal created by Native American artists who use traditional instruments and language) gained popularity throughout the 2000s, especially in parts of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]].",
