  "description": "'''Electro''' (also known as '''electro-funk''', and sometimes referred to as '''electro-pop''') is a genre of [[electronic dance music]] that emerged in the early 1980s. It is defined by the prominent use of the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine, and draws direct influence from early [[hip-hop]] and [[funk]] music.\n\nElectro music is typically characterized by synthetic beats, robotic textures, and minimal or electronically processed vocals—often delivered through [[vocoder]]s or [[talkbox]]es. Unlike its boogie predecessor, which emphasized vocal elements, electro focused more on rhythm and machine-generated sound.\n\nThe genre arose as the popularity of [[disco]] waned in the U.S., blending [[funk]] and early [[hip hop]] elements with influences from New York's boogie scene and electronic pop from Germany and Japan. Foundational artists in the electro movement include [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Warp 9]], and [[Hashim Music|Hashim]]. Pioneering tracks like \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" (1982) and \"[[Nunk (song)|Nunk]]\" (1982) established the genre’s signature sound.\n\nElectro reached peak popularity in the early 1980s. However, the genre began to shift by the mid-decade, incorporating harder beats and rock elements, as seen in the work of groups like [[Run DMC]]. After a period of decline, a revival emerged in the late 1990s led by artists such as [[Anthony Rother]] and DJs like [[Dave Clarke (DJ)|Dave Clarke]]. A third wave of interest surfaced around 2007.\n\nToday, electro continues to evolve through numerous subgenres and fusion styles, maintaining its legacy as a foundational pillar of modern electronic dance music.",
