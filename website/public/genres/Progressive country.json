  "description": "'''Progressive country''' is a term used variously to describe a movement, [[radio format]] or subgenre of [[country music]] which developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a reaction against the slick, [[pop music|pop]]-oriented [[Nashville sound]]. Progressive country artists drew from [[Bakersfield sound|Bakersfield]] and classic [[honky-tonk]] country and [[rock and roll]], as well as [[folk music|folk]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[blues]] and [[Southern rock]]. Progressive country is sometimes conflated with [[outlaw country]], which some country fans consider to be a harder-edged variant, and [[alternative country]]."
