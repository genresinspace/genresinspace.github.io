  "description": "'''Anti-folk''' (sometimes spelled '''antifolk''') is a [[music genre]] that emerged in the 1980s in New York City, founded by the musician, author and comedian [[Lach]], as a reaction to the commercialization of [[folk music]]. It is characterized by its [[do it yourself|DIY ethos]], unconventional songwriting, and often humorous or satirical lyrics. Antifolk music was made to mock the perceived seriousness of the era's mainstream music scene, and artists aim to protest with their mocking and clever lyrics."
