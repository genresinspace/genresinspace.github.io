  "description": "'''Egg punk''' (originally known as '''devo-core''') is an internet-based [[microgenre]] of [[punk rock]] that emerged during the 2010s. The genre is characterized by a [[lo-fi]] recording style and satirical tone, influenced by [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo (band)|Devo]], originally referred to as \"devo-core\". The origins of egg punk are attributed both to a community of [[do it yourself|DIY]] midwestern American punk rock artists from the early 2010s, which included the Coneheads and Lumpy and the Dumpers, as well as their subsequent characterization as \"egg punk\" by a series of [[internet meme]]s circulated in the late 2010s.",
