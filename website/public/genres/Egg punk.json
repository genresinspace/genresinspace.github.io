  "description": "'''Egg punk''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[punk rock]] that emerged during the 2010s. It is an internet-based [[microgenre]] based upon bands with a [[lo-fi]] recording style and satirical tone. The genre is influenced by [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo (band)|Devo]] and historically referred to as '''Devo-core'''. The origins of egg punk are attributed both to a community of [[do it yourself|DIY]] midwestern American punk rock artists from the early 2010s, including The Coneheads and Lumpy and the Dumpers, and their subsequent characterization as \"egg punk\" by a series of [[internet meme|internet memes]] circulated in the late 2010s.",
