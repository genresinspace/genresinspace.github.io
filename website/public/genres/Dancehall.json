  "description": "'''Dancehall''' is a genre of Jamaican [[popular music]] that originated in the late 1970s. Initially, dancehall was a more sparse version of [[reggae]] than the [[roots reggae|roots]] style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. This music genre wasn't officially named until the 1980s, when the two words ''Dance'' and ''Hall'' (referring to the common venue) were joined to form ''Dancehall'', which was then promoted internationally for the first time. At that time digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \"[[ragga]]\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of [[Jamaican Patois]] rather than [[Jamaican English|Jamaican standard English]] and a focus on the track instrumentals (or \"[[riddim]]s\").\n\nDancehall saw initial mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s; by the 1990s, it became increasingly popular in [[Jamaican diaspora]] communities. In the 2000s, dancehall experienced worldwide mainstream. By the 2010s, it began to heavily influence the work of established [[Western world|Western]] artists and producers, which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream.{{Music of Jamaica}}",
