  "description": "'''Progressive soul''' (often shortened to '''prog-soul'''; also called '''black prog''', '''black rock''', and '''progressive R&B''') is a type of [[African-American music]] that uses a [[progressive music|progressive]] approach, particularly in the context of the [[soul music|soul]] and [[funk]] genres. It developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s through the recordings of innovative black musicians who pushed the structural and stylistic boundaries of those genres. Among their influences were musical forms that arose from [[rhythm and blues]] music's transformation into [[rock music|rock]], such as [[Motown (music style)|Motown]], [[progressive rock]], [[psychedelic soul]], and [[jazz fusion]].\n\nProgressive soul music can feature an eclectic range of influences, from both [[African music|African]] and [[European music|European]] sources. Musical characteristics commonly found in works of the genre are traditional R&B melodies, complex vocal patterns, rhythmically unified extended composition, ambitious [[rock music|rock]] guitar, and instrumental techniques borrowed from [[jazz]]. Prog-soul artists often write songs around [[album]]-oriented concepts and [[socially conscious]] topics based in the [[African-American experience]], [[left-wing politics]], and [[bohemianism]], sometimes employing thematic devices from [[Afrofuturism]] and [[science fiction]]. Their lyrics, while challenging, can also be marked by irony and humor.\n\nThe original progressive soul movement peaked in the 1970s with the works of [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], among others. Since the 1980s, both prominent American and British acts have recorded music in its tradition, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], and [[Janelle Mon√°e]]. The [[neo soul]] wave of the late 1990s and early 2000s, featuring the [[Soulquarians]] collective, is considered a derivative development of the genre.",
