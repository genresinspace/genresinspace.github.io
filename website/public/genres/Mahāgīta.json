  "description": "'''''Mahāgīta''''' ({{langx|my|မဟာဂီတ}}; from {{langx|pi|Mahāgīta}}; {{lit|great songs}}), also rendered into Burmese as '''''Thachingyi''''' ({{langx|my|သီချင်းကြီး}}), is the complete body or corpus of Burmese classical songs. The songs descend from the musical traditions of the Burmese royal court, and form the basis of Burmese classical music today. ''Mahāgīta'' songs continue to be played during Buddhist rituals, weddings, and public festivals, and performers frequently appear on state-run television shows."
