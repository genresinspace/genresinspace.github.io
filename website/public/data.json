While the term has sometimes been used interchangeably with \"[[psychedelic rock]]\", acid rock also specifically refers to a more musically intense, rawer, or heavier subgenre or sibling of psychedelic rock. Named after [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD), the style is generally defined by heavy, [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars and often contains lyrics with drug references and long improvised [[Jam session|jams]].  \n\nCompared to other forms of psychedelic rock, acid rock features a harder, louder, heavier, or rawer sound. Much of the style overlaps with [[Garage rock|1960s garage punk]], [[proto-metal]], and early heavy, [[blues]]-based [[hard rock]]. It developed mainly from the [[American West Coast]], where groups did not focus on the novelty recording effects or whimsy of British psychedelia; instead, the subgenre emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the [[psychedelic experience]].\n\nAs the movement progressed into the late 1960s and 1970s, elements of acid rock split into two directions, with hard rock and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] on one side and [[progressive rock]] on the other. In the 1990s, the [[stoner metal]] genre combined acid rock with other hard rock styles such as [[grunge]] and [[doom metal]], updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in acid rock and psychedelic-influenced metal.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Acid trance''' is a genre of [[trance music]] that emerged in the late 1980s, focusing on using the acid sound. The trademark sound of \"acid\" is produced with a Roland [[TB-303]] by playing a sequenced melody while altering the instrument's filter cutoff frequency, resonance, envelope modulation, and accent controls. This real-time tone adjustment was not part of the instrument's original intended operation. Acid trance is the best known form of trance music in [[Belgium]]. The form was first showcased at the popular [[Antwerp]] Rave 24 in Belgium, and has created four national number one singles in the country since.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAcid trance may be considered a descendant of [[acid house]], since the genre of trance had not yet been invented during the advent of acid house (or acidhouse).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAcid trance is typically a faster tempo than acid house music, which is a genre that came before the birth of trance. This specific subgenre has a more simplistic approach to arrangement than the trance music commonly associated with the late 1990s.\n\nThe first volumes of [[Trancemaster]] compilations contains a few tracks in acid trance style, just as [[classic trance]] tracks. The difference is, while acid trance tracks focus more on the changing TB-303 lines, classic trance (e.g. [[Dance 2 Trance]], [[Cosmic Baby]], [[The Age of Love (Age of Love single)|Age of Love]], and [[Jam & Spoon]]) tracks are more atmospheric, they use \"softer\" synth-lines, often strings and other [[ambient music]] elements. The line between these two styles is quite blurred; they also emerged about the same time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAcid trance is often associated with the rise of Goa Trance, another trance subgenre that focuses on spirituality and uses imagery that is very complex and existential in nature. Goa Trance was created in the Indian state of [[Goa]]. Goa Gil is thought to be the father of this genre.\n\nThe term \"psytrance\" is often associated with acid trance, and these terms are used interchangeably (even though the genres are not exactly the same). However, typical \"acid\" sounds and effects are found in both genres. Typically samples are used that reference psychedelic drugs and religious topics. The umbrella genre of acid tends to reference psychedelic drugs as a variable of [[electronic dance music]] that is inseparable from the genre.\n\nDrug use appears to be ingrained in the culture of Acid Trance and other genres that derive from acid. Percussion in the genre seems to be manufactured to allow listeners on perspective altering substances to have a psychological response. The steady beating of the drum samples in the genre provides a solid intense base for the overlapping lead melodies typically found in acid trance.\n\nAcid trance artists are often grouped with their classical and Goa counterparts. It is not uncommon to see many of the first acid trance artists featured on [[Goa trance]] compilation albums. However, some of these artists{{who|date=September 2015}} never considered themselves part of the Goa or [[Psychedelic trance|psychedelic]] scene and these compilation albums were often done by their record labels who published acid trance alongside Goa artists.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}",

Adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of [[Pop rock|pop/rock]] music.\n\nAdult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on [[melody]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, abstains from [[profanity]] or complex lyricism, and is most commonly used as [[background music]] in heavily-frequented family areas such as [[supermarket]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[convention center]]s, or [[restaurant]]s. Like most of [[pop music]], its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[Verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]. The format is heavy on romantic [[sentimental ballad]]s which use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments such as [[piano]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and sometimes an [[orchestra]]l set. However, [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] are also usually used, with the electric guitar sound relatively faint and high-pitched. Additionally, post-80s adult contemporary music may feature [[synthesizer]]s (and other electronics, such as [[drum machines]]).\n\nAn AC radio station may play mainstream music, but it usually excludes [[hip hop]], house/techno or [[heavy metal music]] and some forms of [[dance-pop]], [[teen pop]], and [[electronic dance music]] as these are less popular among adults, the target [[Demography|demographic]]. AC radio often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s. A common practice in recent years of adult contemporary stations is to play less newer music and more hits of the past, even some songs that never even charted the AC charts.  This de-emphasis on new songs slows the progression of the AC chart.\n\nOver the years, AC has spawned subgenres including \"hot AC\" (or \"modern AC\"), \"soft AC\" (also known as \"lite AC\"), \"[[Urban adult contemporary|urban AC]]\" (a softer type of [[urban contemporary music]]), \"[[Rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]\" (a softer type of [[rhythmic contemporary]]), and \"[[Christian adult contemporary|Christian AC]]\" (a softer type of [[contemporary Christian music]]). Some stations play only \"hot AC\", \"soft AC\", or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific genre of music; it is merely an assemblage of selected songs from artists of many different [[Music genre|genre]]s.",

These highly skilled orators, poets, musicians, praise singers and satirists traveled extensively, recounting the history of their empires through rhythmic and repetitive delivery.

African-American poetry groups, collectively called [[The Last Poets]] offered the earliest glimpse of Africa’s influence on Western hip hop culture, during the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]]. The group's vocal style incorporated elements of call-and-response and rhythmic chanting rooted in African cultural traditions. Moreover, the name \"The Last Poets\" was inspired by a poem titled \"Towards a Walk in the Sun\" by South African poet [[Keorapetse Kgositsile]].",

In the 1940s and 1950s, the genre reached its peak of popularity often mixing with [[son cubano]] giving rise to the hybrid style known as '''afro-son''' (or son-afro).

Historically, Afro-Caribbean music was influenced by the transatlantic slave trade and later, by the resistance and emancipation of slaves. Stylistically, afro-Caribbean music has been influenced by various African, European and Indigenous Latin American influences. African influences are reflected by many of the [[Rhythm]]s, vocal characteristics and instruments that are used in afro-Caribbean music. Afro-Caribbean music shares many commonalities with traditional European style music, using many European instruments, harmonies and melodies in music of the genre. Indigenous Latin American influence can be seen through the use of percussive instruments and certain vocal techniques. Afro-Caribbean music has many common musical characteristics, including the use of [[Polyrhythm]]s, [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] invocations and a variety of instruments. Instruments commonly used in afro-Caribbean music include drums, other percussion instruments, and guitars. \n\nAlthough the roots of afro-Caribbean music go back to the 15th century, the official local industry only began in the 1920s. Following this, afro-Caribbean music gained global popularity throughout the 20th century. As afro-Caribbean music gained popularity, many sub-genres began to emerge.

Afrobeats is less of a style per se, and more of a descriptor for the fusion of sounds flowing out of Ghana and Nigeria.

Historian and cultural critic [[Paul Gilroy]] reflects on the changing London music scene as a result of shifting demographics:\n\n<blockquote>We are moving towards an African majority which is diverse both in its cultural habits and in its relationship to colonial and postcolonial governance, so the shift away from Caribbean dominance needs to be placed in that setting. Most of the [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] folks are African kids, either the children of migrants or migrants themselves. It's not clear what Africa might mean to them.</blockquote>\n\n\n\nIn his earlier book, ''[[The Black Atlantic]]'', Gilroy rejects the notion that Black culture and music can be bound to one geographical region. Afrobeats exemplifies this syncretism as a transnational genre that since 2019 has received international attention. David Drake writes about popular Nigerian music noting it is \"Picking up on trends from the U.S., Jamaica, and Trinidad, they reimagine diasporic influences and—more often than not—completely reinvent them.\"\n\nAfrobeats began to experience widespread global mainstream acclaim in the late 2010s, with artists achieving success across Africa, Europe, and North America.

Alpine folk is characterized by [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]] and [[Variation (music)|variation]], uncomplicated [[Key (music)|major key]] [[Melody|melodies]] and simple [[Harmony|harmonies]]. Typical instruments range from [[alpenhorn]]s to [[hackbrett]]s, [[zither]]s and acoustic [[guitar]]s, and even [[violas]] and [[Steirische Harmonika|harmonica]]s. Harmonized singing is frequent, but other pieces may require [[yodeling]], while [[instrumental music|instrumental]] arrangements are particularly frequent for fast dances or brass pieces.\n\nAlpine folk continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with ''[[Volkstümliche Musik]]'', which is largely to be found in [[broadcasting]] [[Mass media|media]] and on ancillary [[merchandise]]. Since the 1970s, artists of a ''[[Neue Volksmusik]]'' genre, such as [[Werner Pirchner]] or [[Biermösl Blosn]], attempt to combine traditional styles with [[jazz]], [[Contemporary folk music|folk]], [[electronic music]], [[Rock music|rock]] et al. as a kind of [[world music]].

[[AllMusic]] defines it as comprising \"hip-hop groups that refuse to conform to any of the traditional stereotypes of rap, such as [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]], [[Miami bass|bass]], [[hardcore hip-hop|hardcore]], and party rap. Instead, they blur genres drawing equally from [[funk]] and [[Pop rock|pop/rock]], as well as [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[reggae]], and even [[Folk music|folk]].\"\n\nAlternative hip-hop developed in the late 1980s and experienced a degree of [[Mainstream radio|mainstream]] recognition during the early to mid-1990s. While some groups such as [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]] and the [[Fugees]] achieved commercial success, many alternative rap acts tend to be embraced by [[alternative rock]] listeners rather than hip-hop or [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.  The commercial and cultural momentum was impeded by the simultaneous emergence of significantly harder-edged West Coast [[gangsta rap]]. A resurgence came about in the late 1990s and early 2000s at the dawn of the [[digital era]] with a rejuvenated interest in [[independent music]] by the general public.\n\nDuring the 2000s, alternative hip-hop reattained its place within the mainstream due to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap as well as the [[Crossover music|crossover]] success of artists such as [[Outkast]] and [[Kanye West]]. The alternative hip-hop movement has expanded beyond the United States to include the [[Somali people|Somali]]-Canadian poet [[K'naan]] and the British artist [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] Alternative hip-hop acts have attained much critical acclaim, but receive relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets. The most prominent alternative hip-hop acts include [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[De La Soul]], [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]], [[the Pharcyde]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Death Grips]] and [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]]. During the 2010s, the development of alternative hip hop music continued with the internet era and the appearance of streaming services, with many artists taking a more \"experimental\" approach to hip hop music, such as [[ASAP Rocky]], [[Yung Lean]], [[Bladee]], [[Chief Keef]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[Lil Pump]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[Ski Mask the Slump God]], [[Lil Peep]], and [[SpaceGhostPurrp]]. Playboi Carti's 2020 album ''[[Whole Lotta Red|Whole Lotta Red]]'', for example, is marked by this approach.",

Alternative rock acts achieved mainstream success in the 1990s with the likes of the [[grunge]] subgenre in the United States, and the [[Britpop]] and [[shoegaze]] subgenres in the United Kingdom and Ireland. During this period, many record labels were looking for \"alternatives\", as many [[Arena rock|corporate rock]], [[hard rock]], and [[glam metal]] acts from the 1980s were beginning to grow stale throughout the [[music industry]]. The emergence of [[Generation X]] as a [[Culture|cultural]] force in the 1990s also contributed greatly to the rise of alternative music.\n\n\"Alternative\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream or [[arena rock|commercial rock]] or pop. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to musicians influenced by the musical style or independent, [[DIY ethic|DIY]] ethos of late-1970s [[punk rock]]. Traditionally, alternative rock varied in terms of its sound, social context, and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and [[zine]]s, [[college radio]] [[airplay]], and [[word of mouth]] had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock's distinct styles (and music scenes), such as [[noise pop]], [[indie rock]], [[grunge]], and [[shoegaze]]. In September 1988, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] introduced \"alternative\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like [[KROQ-FM]] in Los Angeles and [[WFME-FM|WDRE-FM]] in New York, which were playing music from more [[Underground music|underground]], independent, and non-commercial rock artists.\n\nInitially, several alternative styles achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as [[R.E.M.]] and [[Jane's Addiction]], were signed to [[major labels]]. Most alternative bands at the time, like [[the Smiths]], one of the key British alternative rock bands during the 1980s, remained signed to [[independent label]]s and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the popularity of the grunge and [[Britpop]] movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream, and many alternative bands became successful.\n\nEmo found mainstream success in the 2000s with multi-platinum acts such as [[Fall Out Boy]], [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Paramore (band)|Paramore]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]]. Bands such as [[the White Stripes]] and [[the Strokes]] found commercial success in the early 2000s, influencing an influx of new alternative rock bands that drew inspiration from [[garage rock]], [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], establishing a [[Post-punk revival|revival]] of the genres.",

''[[The Independent]]'' described alt-pop as \"a home-made, personalized imitation of the mainstream that speaks far closer to actual teenage experience\", and which is commonly characterized by a dark or downbeat emotional tone with lyrics about insecurity, regret, drugs, and anxiety.\n\nAccording to ''[[AllMusic]]'', the alternative scene's \"left-of-center pop\" failed to experience mainstream success during the 1980s, although the UK alternative pop band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] saw success in that decade. Canadian singer [[Avril Lavigne]]'s success in the early 2000s, including her hit single \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", helped set the stage for a subsequent generation of female alt-pop singers. In the late 2000s, American singer [[Santigold]] established herself as an \"alternative pop hero\" due to her apparent artistic conviction.\n\nIn the early 2010s, American singer [[Lana Del Rey]] developed a \"cult-like following\" with her \"cinematic, beat-heavy alt-pop\", which was characterized by an \"alluring sadness and melodrama\". New Zealand alt-pop singer [[Lorde]] achieved global success in 2013 and 2014, topping charts and winning awards. In 2022, American singer [[Billie Eilish]] was credited with marking the \"ascendence\" of alternative pop in the mainstream with her dark, downbeat pop.",

Instruments typically used to perform Appalachian music include the [[banjo]], [[American fiddle]], [[Appalachian dulcimer|fretted dulcimer]], and later the [[guitar]].\n\nEarly recorded Appalachian musicians include [[Fiddlin' John Carson]], [[G. B. Grayson]] & [[Henry Whitter]], [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], the [[Carter Family]], [[Clarence Ashley]], and [[Dock Boggs]], all of whom were initially recorded in the 1920s and 1930s. Several Appalachian musicians obtained renown during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, including [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Roscoe Holcomb]], [[Ola Belle Reed]], [[Lily May Ledford]], [[Hedy West]] and [[Doc Watson]]. Country and bluegrass artists such as [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Roy Acuff]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Chet Atkins]], The [[Stanley Brothers]] and [[Don Reno]] were heavily influenced by traditional Appalachian music.",

A form of dance, [[Bachata (dance)|bachata]], also developed with the music.\n\nIn the 1990s bachata's instrumentation changed from nylon string Spanish guitar and maracas of [[traditional bachata]] to the [[electric guitar|electric steel string]] and guira of modern bachata. Bachata further transformed in the 21st century with the creation of urban bachata styles by bands such as [[Monchy y Alexandra]] and [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]]. These new modern styles of bachata became an international phenomenon, and today bachata is one of the most popular styles of Latin music.\n\nThe original term used to name the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness\", \"bitter music\"), until the mood-neutral term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata originates from  the pan-[[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] American style called [[bolero]] and [[Son (music)|son]]. The genre mixed these and the troubadour singing tradition common in Latin America (and later, from the mid-1980s, [[Merengue music|merengue]]).

Fans of bands inspired by Balkan bands, such as [[Gogol Bordello]], often state that it is a type of music better experienced than listened to.\n\nIt is sometimes accompanied by a ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'', a traditional [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] communal dance where in its simplest forms, the two steps forward, one step backward choreography, is designed to encourage the participation of all.\n\nPerformers are called ''trubači'' (''трубачи'') in the [[Serbo-Croatian]], or less commonly, ''trubari.'' Some of the best known examples of acclaimed music in this style are the [[Goran Bregović]] Band and the [[Boban Marković|Boban Marković Orkestar]]. Roma have adopted this tradition and make up a large percentage of Balkan brass bands.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian film maker]] [[Emir Kusturica]] has, through his films (''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]''), made the style popular in the international community outside the Balkans.\n\nThe biggest [[brass band]] event in the world, the [[Guča Trumpet Festival]], is a 5-day annual festival with 300,000 visitors, in [[Guča]], [[Serbia]].",

Historically, the music featured at balls has been whatever is popular within the black LGBT community at the time, ranging from disco, to club music, to house, to rap and R&B. House music, the primary sound of the balls, is always upwards of 120 beats per minute and has African roots, which is reflected in the rhythm.\n\nToday, it is common for older house classics like \"Work This Pussy\" by [[Junior Vasquez|Ellis D]], \"Cunty\" by [[Kevin Aviance]], and \"The Ha Dance\" by [[Masters at Work]] to be remixed into new hits by the current wave of DJs and producers. Ballroom Icon DJ's Vjuan Allure, [[Angel X]], and [[MikeQ]], were the first DJs considered to have developed the first remixes of ballroom sound. In order, Vjuan Allure was the first to remix \"The Ha Dance\" in 2000, followed by Angel X in 2002, and then MikeQ in 2005. Overall, ball culture has been a fertile ground for new forms of [[house music]] and other genres of [[electronic dance music]] through its [[Disc jockey|DJs]].\n\nAccording to [[PBS]] Sound Field interview with [[MikeQ]], one of ball music's pioneers, ball music started as house music that was being played at ballroom parties. Over time, distinct features of ball music emerged, for instance the \"Ha\" crash, being placed on the every fourth of [[Four to the floor|4 beats]] and the minimal repetitive vocals, provided by ball commentators. The \"Ha\" crash cymbals often signify the time for ball dancers to strike a pose or hit the floor. Modern vogue music, along with house, incorporates elements of [[disco]], [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B]], [[Jersey club]] and other electronic music.\n\nThe culture has also influenced a wave of [[LGBT hip hop|queer hip hop]] artists such as [[Zebra Katz]], [[House of Ladosha]], and [[Le1f]].",

The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward [[voice leading]], in [[Tag (Barbershop)|tags]] or [[Coda (music)|codas]], or when some appropriate [[ornament (music)|embellishment]] can be created.  One characteristic feature of barbershop harmony is the use of what is known as \"snakes\" and \"swipes\". This is when a chord is altered by a change in one or more non-melodic voices.  Occasional passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts.\n\nBarbershop music is generally performed by either a '''[[barbershop quartet]]''', a group of four typically male singers with one on each vocal part, or a '''barbershop chorus''', which closely resembles a [[choir]] with the notable exception of the genre of music.\n\nAccording to the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]] (BHS), \"Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that resolve primarily around the [[circle of fifths]], while making frequent use of other resolutions.\" Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held (or sped up) [[ad libitum]].\n\nAside from the [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], the voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to their classical music counterparts; the tenor range and [[tessitura]] are similar to those of the classical [[countertenor]] (including the fact that they sing their highest notes primarily in [[falsetto]], as a countertenor would), the baritone resembles a high [[lyric baritone]] in range and a [[tenor]] in tessitura, and the lead generally corresponds to the [[tenor]] of classical repertoire, with some singers possessing a tessitura more similar to that of a [[Baritenor|high baritone]].

Because in bard music songwriters perform their own songs, the genre is also commonly referred to as '''author song''' ({{langx|ru|авторская песня}}, ''avtorskaya pesnya'') or '''bard song''' ({{langx|ru|бардовская песня}}, ''bardovskaya pesnya'').\n\nBard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in being sung with simple guitar accompaniment, as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that it focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry is often in the form of a narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is that the music is far less important than the lyrics; [[chord progression]]s are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. A far more obvious difference is the commerce-free nature of the genre; songs are written to be sung and not to be sold, as the bards are often working professionals in a non-musical occupation.\n\nStylistically, the precursors to bard songs were Russian ''urban romances'', which touched upon common life and were popular throughout all layers of Russian society in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. These romances were traditionally written in a minor key and performed with a guitar accompaniment.\n\nBard poetry may be roughly classified into two main genres: ''tourist song'' and ''political song'', although some other subgenres are also recognized, such as ''outlaw song'' and ''pirate song''.\n\nInitially the term \"bard\" was used by fans of the tourist song genre, and outside those circles, the term was often perceived as slightly derisive. However, there was a need for a term to distinguish this style of song from the traditional mainstream pop song, and the term eventually stuck.\n\nMany bards have performed their songs for small groups of people using a [[Russian guitar]], and rarely, if ever, would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Bards who became popular were eventually able to hold modest concerts. Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, given the political nature of many of their songs. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around via the copying of amateur recordings (known as [[magnitizdat]]) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of a political nature.",

This has not generally led to increased appreciation for the music of the beach bands, however.

The style features compositions characterized by a fast tempo (usually exceeding 200 bpm), complex [[chord progression]]s with rapid chord changes and numerous [[Modulation (music)|changes of key]], instrumental virtuosity, and [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]] based on a combination of [[harmonic structure]], the use of scales, and occasional references to the [[melody]].\n\nBebop developed as the younger generation of jazz musicians expanded the creative possibilities of jazz beyond the popular, dance-oriented [[swing music]]-style to a new \"musician's music\" that was not as danceable and demanded close listening.  As bebop was not intended for dancing, it enabled the musicians to play at faster tempos. Bebop musicians explored advanced harmonies, complex [[syncopation]], [[altered chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, chord substitutions, asymmetrical phrasing, and intricate melodies. Bebop groups used [[rhythm section]]s in a way that expanded their role. Whereas the key ensemble of the swing music era was the [[big band]] of 16–18 musicians playing in an ensemble-based style, the classic bebop group was a small combo that consisted of [[saxophone]] (alto or tenor), [[trumpet]], [[piano]], [[guitar]], [[double bass]], and [[Drum kit|drums]] playing music in which the ensemble played a supportive role for soloists. Rather than play heavily arranged music, bebop musicians typically played the melody of a composition (called the \"head\") with the accompaniment of the rhythm section, followed by a section in which each of the performers improvised a solo, then returned to the melody at the end of the composition.\n\nSome of the most influential bebop artists, who were typically composer-performers, are [[alto sax]] player [[Charlie Parker]]; [[tenor sax]] players [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Sonny Rollins]], and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]]; [[clarinet]] player [[Buddy DeFranco]]; trumpeters [[Fats Navarro]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Dizzy Gillespie]]; pianists [[Bud Powell]], [[Barry Harris]] and [[Thelonious Monk]]; [[electric guitar|electric guitarist]] [[Charlie Christian]]; and drummers [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Art Blakey]].",

Earning wide reception among the young in the Visayas and Mindanao, Bisrock is a fairly recent cultural phenomenon. The style started around the 1980s, when Cebu's rock scene was beginning to be labeled as \"Bisrock\". During this time, a group of musicians from the [[University of San Carlos]] coined the local music scene as Bisrock in support of patriotism for the Cebuano music scene. However, this genre is debatable as Bisrock seems to be popular only in Cebu.

Bluegrass has roots in African American genres like [[blues]] and [[jazz]] and North European genres, such as [[Irish Ballads|Irish ballads]] and [[dance tune]]s. Unlike country, it is traditionally played exclusively on [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] instruments such as the fiddle, mandolin, banjo, guitar and upright bass.  It was further developed by musicians who played with Monroe, including 5-string banjo player [[Earl Scruggs]] and guitarist [[Lester Flatt]]. Bill Monroe once described bluegrass music as, \"It's a part of [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]] traditions. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\"\n\nBluegrass features acoustic stringed instruments and emphasizes the [[Beat (music)#On-beat and off-beat|off-beat]]. The off-beat can be \"driven\" (played close to the previous bass note) or \"swung\" (played farther from the previous bass note). Notes are anticipated, in contrast to laid-back blues where notes are behind the beat; this creates the higher energy characteristic of bluegrass. In bluegrass, as in most forms of jazz, one or more instrumentalists take a turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform [[accompaniment]]; this is especially typified in tunes called [[Breakdown (music)#Bluegrass|breakdowns]]. This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], where all instrumentalists play the melody together, or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity, and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Blues''' is a [[music genre]] and [[musical form]] that originated among African Americans in the [[Deep South]] of the United States around the 1860s.  Blues has incorporated [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]], [[work song]]s, [[field holler]]s, [[Ring shout|shouts]], [[chant]]s, and rhymed simple narrative [[ballad (music)|ballads]] from the [[African-American culture]]. The blues form is ubiquitous in [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll]], and is characterized by the [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern, the [[blues scale]], and specific [[chord progression]]s, of which the [[twelve-bar blues]] is the most common. [[Blue note]]s (or \"worried notes\"), usually thirds, fifths or sevenths flattened in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], are also an essential part of the sound. Blues [[shuffle note|shuffles]] or [[walking bass]] reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the [[groove (popular music)|groove]].\n\nBlues music is characterized by its [[lyrics]], [[Bassline|bass lines]], and [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]. Early [[traditional blues verse]]s consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the [[Bar form|AAB pattern]], consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the [[racial discrimination]] and other challenges experienced by African Americans.\n\nMany elements, such as the [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the [[music of Africa]]. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the African-American community, the [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the [[Abolitionism in the United States|ending of slavery]], with the development of [[juke joint]]s occurring later. It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the 20th century. The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. Blues [[List of blues genres|subgenres]] include [[country blues]], [[Delta blues]] and [[Piedmont blues]], as well as urban blues styles such as [[Chicago blues]] and [[West Coast blues]]. [[World War II]] marked the transition from acoustic to [[electric blues]] and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called [[blues rock]] developed, which blended blues styles with [[rock music]].",

It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock (electric guitar, electric bass guitar, drums, and sometimes with keyboards and harmonica). From its beginnings in the early to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced [[hard rock]], [[Southern rock]], and early [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\nBlues rock started with rock musicians in the United Kingdom and the United States performing American blues songs. They typically recreated electric [[Chicago blues]] songs, such as those by [[Willie Dixon]], [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Jimmy Reed]], at faster tempos and with a more aggressive sound common to rock. In the UK, the style was popularized by groups such as [[the Rolling Stones]], [[the Yardbirds]], and [[the Animals]], who put several blues songs into the pop charts. In the US, [[Lonnie Mack]], the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]], and [[Canned Heat]] were among the earliest exponents. Some of these bands also played long, involved improvisations as were then commonplace on jazz records. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the style became more hard rock-oriented. In the US, [[Johnny Winter]], the early [[Allman Brothers Band]], and [[ZZ Top]] represented a hard rock trend, along with [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Chicken Shack]], and [[Foghat]] in the UK.\n\nAlong with hard rock, blues rock songs became the core of the music played on [[album-oriented rock]] radio in the United States, and later the [[classic rock]] format established there during the 1980s.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Bolero''' is a genre of [[song]] which originated in [[Oriente Province|eastern Cuba]] in the late 19th century as part of the [[trova]] tradition. Unrelated to the older [[Bolero (Spanish dance)|Spanish dance of the same name]], bolero is characterized by sophisticated lyrics dealing with love. It has been called the \"quintessential Latin American romantic song of the twentieth century\".\n\nUnlike the simpler, thematically diverse ''[[canción]]'', bolero did not stem directly from the European lyrical tradition, which included Italian [[opera]] and [[canzone]], popular in urban centers like Havana at the time. Instead, it was born as a form of romantic folk poetry cultivated by a new breed of [[troubadour]] from [[Santiago de Cuba]], the ''trovadores''. [[Pepe Sánchez (trova)|Pepe Sánchez]] is considered the father of this movement and the author of the first bolero, \"Tristezas\", written in 1883. Originally, boleros were sung by individual ''trovadores'' while playing [[guitar]]. Over time, it became common for trovadores to play in groups as ''dúos'', ''tríos'', ''cuartetos'', etc. Thanks to the [[Trío Matamoros]] and, later, [[Los Panchos|Trío Los Panchos]], bolero achieved widespread popularity in Latin America, the United States and Spain. At the same time, Havana had become a fertile ground where bolero composers met to create compositions and improvise new tunes; it was the so-called ''[[Filin (music)|filin]]'' movement, which derived its name from the English word \"''feeling''\". Many of the genre's most enduring pieces were written then and popularized in radio and cabaret performances by singers such as [[Olga Guillot]] and [[Elena Burke]], backed by orchestras and big bands.\n\nBoleros are generally in 4/4 time and, musically, compositions and arrangements might take a variety of forms. This flexibility has enabled boleros to feature in the repertoire of Cuban [[son cubano|son]] and [[Cuban rumba|rumba]] ensembles, as well as Spanish [[Copla (music)|copla]] and [[flamenco]] singers, since the early 20th century. Occasionally, boleros have been merged with other forms to yield new subgenres, such as the bolero-son, popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and the bolero-cha, popular in the 1950s. In the United States, the [[rhumba]] ballroom dance emerged as an adaptation of the bolero-son in the 1930s. Boleros can also be found in the [[African rumba]] repertoire of many artists from [[Kinshasa]] to [[Dakar]], due to the many bolero records that were distributed to radios there as part of the [[G.V. Series]].\n\nThe popularity of the genre has also been felt as far as Vietnam, where it became a fashionable song style in [[South Vietnam]] before the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and remains popular with the Vietnamese.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Brisbane punk rock''' had its main impact between 1975 and 1984 as part of the overall [[punk rock in Australia|punk rock scene in Australia]]. According to rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], the Queensland capital provided \"some of the most anarchistic bands\" of that era whilst it was \"arguably the most conservative city\" in the country. The development of the local punk movement differed from other cities because of its relative geographic isolation from other similar trends. The Brisbane scene also received a greater scrutiny by local police where early punk bands formed as \"an obvious backlash to an oppressed society\". This generated antagonistic and individualistic groups or \"snot\" driven punk bands.\n \nThe Brisbane punk rock movement can be divided into four phases. First, there was the pioneering chapter, which lasted from 1975 to 1977. These bands were either innovators or part of the first wave of local punk bands. Foremost of all such groups are [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]], which are acknowledged as \"Aussie punk pioneers\". The second phase occurred between 1978 and 1980, which McFarlane described as \"the second generation\" of punk groups. The next period or \"third-generation\" spanned from 1981 to 1984 and diverged into two genres of [[punk rock]] and [[hardcore punk]]. The fourth period, during 1985 to 1988, developed three styles: [[Music of Detroit#1970s|Detroit rock]] (and the closely aligned [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]]), [[hardcore punk]] including [[Crossover thrash]] and [[skate punk]] – the Brisbane punk rock movement had changed to [[alternative rock]].",

Though the merging of folk and rock music came from several sources, it is widely regarded that the success of \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]]\" by British band [[the Animals]] in 1964 was a catalyst, prompting [[Bob Dylan]] to \"[[Electric Dylan controversy|go electric]]\", in which, like the Animals, he brought folk and rock music together, from which other musicians followed. In the same year, [[the Beatles]] began incorporating overt folk influences into their music, most noticeably on their ''[[Beatles for Sale]]'' album. The Beatles and other [[British Invasion]] bands, in turn, influenced the American band [[the Byrds]], who released their recording of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" in April 1965, setting off the mid-1960s American folk rock movement. A number of British groups, usually those associated with the British folk revival, moved into folk rock in the mid-1960s, including [[the Strawbs]], [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], and [[Fairport Convention]].\n\nBritish folk rock was taken up and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of [[Brittany]], Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the [[Isle of Man]], to produce [[Celtic rock]] and its derivatives, and has been influential in countries with close cultural connections to Britain. It gave rise to the genre of [[folk punk]]. By the 1980s the genre was in steep decline in popularity, but survived and revived in significance, partly merging with the [[rock music]] and [[folk music]] cultures from which it originated. Some commentators have found a distinction in some British folk rock, where the musicians are playing traditional folk music with electric instruments rather than merging rock and folk music, and they distinguish this form of playing by calling it \"electric folk\".",

The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures [[Cyril Davies]] and [[Alexis Korner]] to turn to [[electric blues]] and form the band [[Blues Incorporated]], which became something of a clearing house for British [[rhythm and blues]] musicians. A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success. Major acts included [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[the Animals]], [[the Yardbirds]], [[Them (band)|Them]], and [[the Spencer Davis Group]], who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964, in the wake of the [[beat music|Merseybeat]] craze, becoming central to the [[beatnik]] and [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] in the UK and a second wave of [[British Invasion]] acts in the US.\n\nSeveral of the bands and their members went on to become leading [[rock music]] performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s, helping to create [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[progressive rock|progressive]] and [[hard rock]] and making rhythm and blues a key component of that music. In the mid to late-1970s, British R&B enjoyed a revival through the [[British soul]] and [[disco]] scenes, the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] circuit, [[new wave music]] and the [[mod revival]], and has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the late 1980s. In the 2000s, a British version of [[contemporary R&B]] began gaining popularity, and since the late 2000s the success of British female singers influenced by soul and R&B led to talk of another \"R&B British invasion\".",

Musically, Britpop produced bright, catchy [[alternative rock]], with significant influences from British [[guitar pop]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Britpop was considered a musical reaction to the darker lyrical themes and soundscapes of the American-led [[grunge]] music of the time, and Britain's own [[shoegaze]] music scene. The movement brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the larger [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British popular cultural]] movement, [[Cool Britannia]], which evoked the [[Swinging Sixties]] and the British [[guitar pop]] of that decade.\n\nBritpop was a phenomenon that highlighted bands emerging from the [[independent music]] scene of the early 1990s. Although often seen as a cultural moment rather than a distinct musical genre, its associated bands typically drew inspiration from the British pop music of the 1960s, the [[glam rock]] and [[punk rock]] of the 1970s, and the [[indie pop]] of the 1980s.\n\nThe most successful bands linked with Britpop were [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Suede (band)|Suede]], and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]], known as the \"big four\" of the movement. The timespan of Britpop's popularity is generally considered to be 1993–1997, and its peak years to be 1995–1996. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis (dubbed \"The Battle of Britpop\") brought the movement to the forefront of the British press in 1995. While music was the main focus, fashion, art and politics also got involved, with [[Tony Blair]] and [[New Labour]] aligning themselves with the movement.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, many Britpop acts began to falter commercially or break up, or otherwise moved towards new genres or styles. Commercially, Britpop lost out to [[teen pop]], while artistically it segued into a [[post-Britpop]] [[Indie rock|indie]] movement, associated with bands such as [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Coldplay]].",

EPondabeat, another producer involved in the scene, claimed that sampling in used for marketing purpose to invoke listener's relatability.\n\nBronx drill rappers employ a variety of lyrical delivery styles, with those in the Bronx drill scene using a particularly aggressive style. \"These little kids from the Bronx are wild. They on demon time. They're angrier with their shit,\" one producer said.\n\nSamples for Bronx drill come from a variety of sources and these sources may differ depending on producer. Bronx-based Cash Cobain mainly uses round-the-century [[contemporary R&B]] and [[hip hop music]] sources; meanwhile, EPondabeat, EvilGiane prefer to use [[soul music]] and [[funk]] recordings for sampling; other producers, such as WAR, do not limit themselves among sampling sources.\n\nMost Bronx drill songs are not granted clearance to sample other works until they've already gained popularity, with some artists saying they don't care to clear their samples at all.\n\nBronx drill, since its inception around 2020, already had a mainstream crossover, when [[Cardi B]] performed on \"[[Shake It (Kay Flock song)|Shake It]]\" by [[Kay Flock]]. Bronx drill has also influenced [[Jersey club#Jersey club rap|Jersey drill]] sound and more commercial drill sound, most particularly the influence can be heard on ''[[B.I.B.L.E.]]'' by [[Fivio Foreign]], where he sampled \"[[Say My Name]]\" by [[Destiny's Child]].\n\nThe Bronx producer Cash Cobain has been described by [[Complex Networks|''Complex Music'']] as inventing sexy drill which tones down the violent nature of drill, while still drawing on the sampling techniques. Cobain said, \"I think everybody wants to feel good, party, and just feel sexy\". Complex wrote that Cobain is \"changing the sound of New York\".\n\n[[Ice Spice]] and [[Kenzo B]] emerged from the Bronx drill scene.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Brostep''' is a harder form of [[dubstep]] that emerged during the late 2000s and early 2010s and pioneered by artists like [[Skrillex]] and [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]].\n\n\nIn 2011, dubstep gained significant traction in the US market, by way of a [[post-dubstep]] style known as Brostep, with the American producer Skrillex becoming something of a \"[[poster boy]]\" for the Dubstep scene. In September 2011, a ''[[Spin Magazine]]'' EDM special referred to brostep as a \"lurching and aggressive\" variant of dubstep that has proven commercially successful in the United States. Unlike traditional dubstep production styles, which emphasise sub-bass content, brostep accentuates the middle [[Register (music)|register]] and features \"robotic fluctuations and metal-esque aggression\". According to [[Simon Reynolds]], as dubstep gained larger audiences and moved from smaller club-based venues to larger outdoor events, sub-sonic content was gradually replaced by distorted bass [[Riff#Riff|riffs]] that function roughly in the same register as the electric guitar in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].\n\nThe term ''brostep'', sarcastically coined in 2009, has been used by some as a pejorative descriptor for a style of popular [[Americanization|Americanised]] dubstep.\n\n\nThe producer known as Rusko himself claimed in an interview on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] that \"brostep is sort of my fault, but now I've started to hate it in a way&nbsp;... It's like someone screaming in your face&nbsp;... you don't want that.\" According to a BBC review of his 2012 album [[Songs (Rusko album)|''Songs'']], the record was a muddled attempt by Rusko to realign his music with a \"Jamaican inheritance\" and distance it from the \"belching, aggressive, resolutely macho\" dubstep produced by his contemporaries.\n\nCommenting on the success of American producers such as Skrillex, Skream stated: \"I think it hurts a lot of people over here because it's a UK sound, but it's been someone with influences outside the original sound that has made it a lot bigger. The bad side of that is that a lot of people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But in all honesty it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes.\" Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers [[Datsik (musician)|Datsik]] and [[Excision (musician)|Excision]]. Their production style has been described by ''[[Mixmag]]'' as \"a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] fans than it did to lovers of UK garage\". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [[Nu metal]] band [[Korn]]'s 2011 album ''[[The Path of Totality]]'' features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. This style of dubstep is sometimes known as metalstep.\n{{clear}}",

Its best-known performer and innovator, [[Wilfred Peters]] is regarded as a [[Belize]]an national icon. The word ''brukdown'' may come from ''broken down calypso'', referring to the similarities between brukdown and [[Trinidad]]ian [[calypso music]]; the presence of large numbers of [[Jamaica]]ns in Belize also led to an influence from [[mento]] music.\n\nBrukdown's main purpose is to tell the story of the [[Belizean Creole]] people. A typical Brukdown song may reflect the journey of the African slaves to the mahogany slave camps of Belize, but the genre has been sustained by its usefulness in spreading the word of historical and current events to the large illiterate population of Belize. As a result, Brukdown is frequently played at events with large gatherings– specifically around [[Christmas]] time. The Brukdown singer is often the bearer of news, and the words of the composer are widely accepted as fact, despite the gossip-like nature of the genre.\n\nBrukdown is a [[Belizean Kriol people|Kriol]] mixture of European [[harmony|harmonies]] ([[Accordion]]), African [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[rhythm]]s and [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] format and lyrical elements from the native peoples of the area. In its modern form, brukdown is rural folk music, associated especially with the logging towns of the Belizean interior. Traditional instruments include the [[banjo]], [[guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]], dingaling [[bell (musical instrument)|bell]], [[accordion]] and a donkey's [[jaw]]bone played by running a stick up and down the teeth, and also a [[grater]]. Brukdown remains a rural, rarely recorded genre. This genre of music has primarily African elements, while the only significant European element, is the [[Accordion]].",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Slam death metal''' (also referred to simply as '''slam''') is a subgenre of brutal death metal which focuses on slam riffs. The genre originated from the 1990s [[New York City|New York]] death metal scene, incorporating elements of [[New York hardcore (genre)|New York hardcore]] and [[hip hop music]]. In contrast to other death metal styles, it is not generally focused on guitar solos and blast beats; instead, it employs mid-tempo rhythms, breakdowns and palm-muted riffing, as well as hip hop-inspired vocal and drum beat rhythms. When blast beats are used, it is often traditional blasts and gravity blasts used only as accents. [[Syncopation]] between guitar and drums is also a focal point.\n\nIn addition to slower riffing, slam death metal is also said to be characterized by guttural vocals and a \"high pitched, ringy\" [[snare drum]] sound. The subgenre \"shares some of the bounce and groove from [[nu metal]],\" and tends to avoid the experimental elements common in early death metal.\n\nThe [[Breakdown (music)#Heavy metal and punk rock|breakdown]] riff of Suffocation's \"Liege of Inveracity\" (1991) has been credited by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as the first slam riff in death metal.  The first wave of bands in the genre were New York bands like [[Internal Bleeding (band)|Internal Bleeding]], Pyrexia and Afterbirth, with notable groups from outside of this state from this time including [[Devourment]] and [[Cephalotripsy (band)|Cephalotripsy]].\n\nThe name \"slam\" in reference to death metal was coined by the members of Internal Bleeding. In a 2024 interview, Internal Bleeding guitarist Chris Pervelis explained that because the band's emphasis on groove was to encourage [[moshing]], they originally called their music \"mosh\" metal, \"barbaric mosh\" or \"death mosh\". However, drummer Bill Tolley associated the word \"mosh\" with the jovial tone of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. To avoid this association Tolley pushed for the word \"slam\" due to its early hardcore origins.\n\n\nThe popularity of [[deathcore]] and its shared interest in breakdowns led to a revived interest in slam beginning in the mid–2000s, seen through the popularity of groups including Infected Malignity and Abominable Putridity and the reformation of Devourment. This wave saw an increase in production quality in the genre, a contrast from the raw production of earlier bands. This wave was largely based online, particularly on social media sites, with the [[Facebook]] group Slam Worldwide playing a major role in promotion. This led to many groups forming outside of the genre's native United States, such as [[Extermination Dismemberment]] from Belarus, Coprocephalic from Taiwan, Acranius from Germany and a number of groups from the Philippines: Human Mastication, Nekroholocaust, Cranial Torture, Pus Vomit, Projectile Vomit and Impulsive Emesis. Furthermore, northern England, particularly [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]], developed a scene during this wave, with groups including [[Ingested (band)|Ingested]] and Exhumation, as well as UK Slam Festival. To the extent that ''Distorted Sound'' magazine called Manchester \"''Slam''chester\". In a 2009 article by ''[[MetalSucks]]'' stated \"slam is THE big thing in death metal right now, divisive as it is\".\n\nSlam was integral to the development of the genres [[beatdown hardcore]] and [[deathcore]]. Furthermore, elements of its sound, particular its distinctive riffing style, has been incorporated into merged with various genres including hardcore, black metal and general death metal.",

Bands like [[Helix (band)|Helix]], [[Kick Axe]], [[Brighton Rock (band)|Brighton Rock]], [[Killer Dwarfs]], [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], and [[Slik Toxik]] saw growing popularity in the mid-1980s thanks in part to [[Much Music]] and [[MTV]] playing their videos in regular rotation.\n\nCanada's [[death metal]] scene has produced artists most of whom are based out of [[Quebec]].

The band has released fifteen studio albums, and has been cited as having influenced many notable heavy metal groups, including [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Metallica]]. The band was the subject of the 2008 documentary film, ''[[Anvil! The Story of Anvil]]''.

Cantopop is also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. The genre began in the 1970s and became associated with Hong Kong popular music from the middle of the decade. Cantopop then reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before slowly declining in the 2000s and shrinking in the 2010s. The term \"Cantopop\" itself was coined in 1978 after \"Cantorock\", a term first used in 1974. In the 1980s, Cantopop reached its highest glory with fanbase and concerts all over the world, especially in [[Macau]], [[Mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]]. This was even more obvious with the influx of songs from [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong movies]] during the time.\n\nBesides [[Western culture|Western]] pop music, Cantopop is also influenced by other international genres, including [[jazz]], [[rock and roll]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[disco]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[ballad]] and others. Cantopop songs are almost invariably performed in [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. Boasting a multi-national fanbase, the genre has gained popularity in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Additionally, it has found following in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in southeastern mainland China. Hong Kong remains as the significant hub of the genre.",

Celtic fusion may or may not include authentic traditional music from any one tradition under the Celtic umbrella, but its common characteristic is the inspiration by Celtic identity.\n\nThe oldest musical tradition which fits under the label of Celtic fusion originated in the rural American south in the early colonial period and incorporated [[Scotland|Scottish]], [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]], [[Ireland|Irish]], and [[African American]] influences. Variously referred to as [[American folk music|roots music]], American folk music, or [[old-time music]], this tradition has exerted a strong influence on all forms of American music, including [[Country music|country]], [[blues]], and [[rock and roll]]. The connections between traditional Scottish and Irish music and Rock music are deep and go back to the origins of American music. As Elvis Costello put it:\n\n<blockquote>\"I started with rock n' roll and... then you start to take it apart like a child with a toy and you see there's blues and there's country... Then you go back from country into American music... and you end up in Scotland and Ireland eventually.\"</blockquote>\n\nAnother manifestation of this syncretic tendency emerged in [[New York City]] in the 1890s, as bands performing traditional Irish music for the large [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrant community there began incorporating [[big band]] influences, adding brass and reed instruments and performing [[quickstep]]s, [[Foxtrot (dance)|foxtrot]]s, and other popular contemporary dance tunes.\n\nMore recently, there has been a flowering of several distinct genres of Celtic fusion.

The genre is characterised by its blending of metal's aggressive elements with the melodic and rhythmic structures of Celtic folk, often drawing on themes from Irish mythology and history.  \n\nThe genesis of Celtic metal is closely linked to the Irish band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]], formed in 1992 by Keith Fay. Inspired by the English band [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]] and the Irish rock group [[Horslips]], Cruachan sought to merge black metal with Irish folk music. Their debut album, Tuatha na Gael (1995), is considered a seminal work in the genre. Around the same time, other Irish bands like [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]] and [[Waylander (band)|Waylander]] also began exploring similar musical territories, each bringing their unique interpretations to the fusion of metal and Celtic music. These bands laid the foundation for what would become a vibrant subgenre within the metal community.\n\nOver the years, Celtic metal has expanded beyond Ireland, with bands from various countries incorporating Celtic elements into their music. Swiss band [[Eluveitie]], for example, combines [[melodic death metal]] with Celtic melodies and instruments, even using lyrics in the ancient [[Gaulish]] language.

From the early 1970s to early 1990s, most chamber pop acts saw little to no mainstream success. The genre's decline was attributed to costly touring and recording logistics and a reluctance among [[record label]]s to finance instruments like strings, horns, and keyboards on artists' albums.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, chamber pop developed as a subgenre of [[indie rock]]{{sfn|Tonelli|2004|p=3}} or [[indie pop]] in which musicians opposed the [[distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars, [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic, and simple arrangements common to the [[alternative rock|alternative]] or \"[[modern rock]]\" groups of that era. In Japan, the movement was paralleled by ''[[Shibuya-kei]]'', another indie genre that was formed on some of the same bedrock of influences. By the 2000s, the term \"chamber pop\" would be inconsistently applied to a variety of bands whose work attracted comparisons to ''Pet Sounds''.",

[[Los Tres]] became the most iconic rock band of this era, alongside [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]] in pop.\n\nIn the early 21st century, many more independent artists have become increasingly popular, while the previous ones have consolidated generating a cultural legacy of wide variety and trajectory.

The term was coined in 2009 by the satirical blog Hipster Runoff to lampoon microgenres and indie acts whose sounds resembled [[incidental music]] from 1980s [[VHS]] tapes. Prior to this, the music would have been labelled as [[shoegaze]], [[dream pop]], [[ambient music|ambient]], or [[indietronica]]. Leading acts included [[Neon Indian]], [[Washed Out]], and [[Toro y Moi]], who gained attention during 2009's \"Summer of Chillwave\". Washed Out's 2009 track \"[[Feel It All Around]]\" remains the best-known chillwave song.\n\nMany artists exploited the style's low-budget simplicity, which led to an oversaturation of acts that contributed to the original scene's demise. The phrase \"chillwave\" came to be used as a [[pejorative]] due to the music's perceived shallowness and reliance on nostalgia. Detractors also criticized the term for having been contrived by media publications. It heralded the early 2010s proliferation of Internet music microgenres, including [[vaporwave]], which originated as an ironic variant of chillwave. By the mid-2010s, chillwave had faded in popularity, with most of the original artists and listeners of the genre shifting focus to other music styles.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Slowed and reverb''' (stylized as \"slowed + reverb\") is a technique of remixing and a subgenre, derived from chopped and screwed hip-hop and [[vaporwave]], which involves slowing down and adding reverb to a previously existing song, often created by using [[Audio editing software|digital audio editors]] such as [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]]. The technique originated in 2006 when the Lebanese one-man Black Metal band Kafan re-released it's only demo ''Injecting Evil In Thy Veins'' on cult American label [[Full Moon Productions]] in CD format. The release presents one of the earliest known examples of intentionally slowed down and reverb drenched music outside of hip-hop, predating modern slowed + reverb trends. This method, while commonplace in modern internet music culture, was never seen in extreme metal at the time. The effect creates an unsettling, almost ritualistic soundscape, deepening the record’s oppressive and hypnotic qualities. The eerie, ghostly effect of slowed + reverb tracks that define modern vaporwave and remix culture can be heard here, years before it became a recognized trend. Despite its historical significance, the slowed-down Kafan remixes remain largely unknown outside of niche black metal and experimental music circles. Unlike what happened in 2017, when Houston-based producer Jarylun Moore (known online as slater!), having been inspired by DJ Screw, began uploading remixes of popular songs using the technique to [[YouTube]]. The first of these{{em dash}}a remix of [[Lil Uzi Vert]]'s song \"[[Luv Is Rage 2#Release|20 Min]]\"{{em dash}}earned over one million views on the platform in under two months, eventually earning over four million views before being taken down. The style became especially popular on YouTube, where it became common to play remixes over looping clips from [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] [[anime]] scenes. Other notable producers in this sub-genre include {{proper name|wretchshop}} (also known as ''ciki 8k''), rum world, Aestheticg, imlonely, Chovies, slerb as well as streliz.{{Cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nSlowed and reverb remixes were also uploaded to [[Spotify]] using the service's podcast feature. For [[Okayplayer]], Elijah C. Watson dubbed slowed and reverb remixes \"the soundtrack for [[Generation Z]]\", comparing the style to [[lo-fi hip hop]]. Remixes using the technique also became popular on the video-sharing service [[TikTok]]. \n\nSlowed and reverb remixes became controversial on social media in mid-2020 after a viral video posted to TikTok failed to attribute the creation of slowed and reverb to chopped and screwed, causing users to brand slowed and reverb a \"[[Gentrification|gentrified]]\" version of chopped and screwed. For the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', Shelby Stewart wrote, \"Give DJ Screw his flowers. Slowed + reverb is a poor imitation of what chopped and screwed music is.\" Moore had mixed feelings about the phenomenon, saying, \"I always felt that I shouldn’t touch chopped and screwed music. One, it’s not really screwed if it’s not by Screw. Two, the chops are sacred to the culture, and not everybody can imitate it. So I would never want to even try to. I’m just glad I’m able to bring it to a wider audience.\"\n\nOther responses to the subgenre's popularity were more positive. Despite the backlash from DJ Screw fans, other creators such as Isaac Sigala uploaded slowed and reverb remixes to honor the chopped and screwed genre through [[nostalgia]]. Sigala said of the popularity of his remixes, \"I knew it was gonna happen. I see the kind of emotions that were brought out in me when I first started getting into [slowed music]. I could see how others would express their emotions too.\"\n\nThe YouTube [[Comments section|comments sections]] of slowed and reverb videos are often used as a [[safe haven]] for users, which [[Digital Trends]] described as \"a sensitive reprieve from the toxicity often found on the platform.\" Users commonly share stories of [[heartbreak]] and [[Grief|loss]], which are given support by the slowed and reverb content creators. YouTuber Rayen Hemden said that he feels protective of his commenters and will act as a moderator to keep discussion compassionate. He further stated, \"I make sure there are no hate comments towards the people who share their stories because it takes bravery. Someone has to be courageous to actually share their story.\"",

      "wikitext_description": "The '''chorale motet''' was a type of musical composition in mostly [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] parts of Europe, principally Germany, and mainly during the 16th century.  It involved setting a [[chorale]] melody and text as a [[motet]].\n\nStylistically chorale motets were similar at first to motets composed in [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] countries, and made use of the full range of techniques of [[Dutch School (music)|Franco-Flemish]] [[polyphony]].  In the earlier period, the chorale was typically used as a [[cantus firmus]], fairly easy to hear, with other lines either weaving in and out [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] around it, or following along in the same rhythm in an entirely [[Homophony|homophonic]] style.  Later in the century, especially around 1600, the successive verses of the chorale were used to begin [[imitation (music)|imitative]] sections in a [[fugue|fugal]] style.  Shortly after 1600 the form began to disappear, overtaken by newer forms based on [[Italy|Italian]] (especially [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian]]) models:  the [[chorale concerto]], and later the [[chorale cantata]].  The chorale cantata was to become the most substantial of the descendants of the chorale motet, and eventually culminated in the [[Chorale cantata (Bach)|work of J.S. Bach]].\n\nComposers of early chorale motets included [[Johann Walter]], who typically used a cantus firmus type of motet setting; [[Balthasar Resinarius]], who wrote in the complex polyphonic style; {{ill|Sixt Dietrich|de}}, who chose the simpler homophonic style; and [[Ludwig Senfl]], [[Lupus Hellinck]], [[Thomas Stoltzer]], and others.  Some of these composers were Roman Catholic:  the [[Thirty Years' War]] had not yet torn Germany apart, and composers from both branches of Christianity were still mixing freely.\n\nBetween the late 1560s and the early 1580s, the renowned composer [[Orlande de Lassus]], who was working in [[Munich]], contributed several volumes of chorale motets of his own: ''Newe Teütsche Liedlein mit fünf Stimmen'' (books 1 and 2) and ''Newe teutsche Lieder''.  In these motets the voices are equally balanced, as in the style of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].\n\nAround 1600 a new group of composers, many of whom had studied in Italy, brought new ideas to the chorale motet.  Some of these composers were among the most famous and talented in Europe, including [[Melchior Franck]], [[Hans Leo Hassler]], and the spectacularly prolific [[Michael Praetorius]].  Praetorius's ''Musae Sioniae'' (1605-1610), an enormous collection of approximately 1200 pieces, includes some of the finest and most advanced examples of the form; however, by this time the chorale concerto and other types of chorale settings were beginning to eclipse the chorale motet as a primary means of expression for the German chorale.\n\nBach's son [[Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach]] composed a motet in three movements in the second half of the 18th century, ''[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme (J. C. F. Bach)|Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]'', still using Baroques techniques such as a [[chorale fantasia]] on Nicolai's \"[[Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme]]\" and the inclusion of a setting by his father.",

Primarily in the United States and Canada, Christian adult contemporary radio stations cater to a mostly adult audience and are similar to mainstream [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] stations in that they play hits often and for long periods of time. Christian adult contemporary is generally a continuation of the easy listening and soft rock style Jesus music that became popular in the 1960s and 1970s with some adjustments that reflect the evolution of [[contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[Pop rock|pop/rock]] music.\n\nLike mainstream adult contemporary, Christian adult contemporary tends to have lush, soothing and highly polished qualities where emphasis on [[melody]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] is accentuated. It is usually melodic enough to get a listener's attention, abstains from complex lyricism, and is most commonly used as [[background music]] in heavily-frequented family areas such as [[supermarket]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[convention center]]s, or [[restaurant]]s that are heavily influenced on Christian faiths and beliefs. Like most of [[contemporary Christian music]] (and [[pop music]] in general), its songs tend to be written in a basic format employing a [[Verse–chorus form|verse–chorus structure]]. The format is heavy on [[Worship music|worship]] songs which use [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] instruments such as [[piano]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and sometimes an [[orchestra]]l set. However, [[Electric guitar|electric guitars]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] is also used, with the electric guitar sound relatively faint and high-pitched. Additionally post-80s adult contemporary Christian music may feature [[synthesizer]]s (and other electronics, such [[drum machines]]).\n\nA Christian AC station may play [[contemporary Christian music]], but it usually excludes [[Christian hip hop]] and some forms of [[Christian electronic dance music|Christian]] [[dance-pop]] and [[teen pop]], as these are less popular among adults, the target [[Demography|demographic]]. Christian AC radio, like mainstream AC radio, often targets the 25–44 age group, the demographic that has received the most attention from advertisers since the 1960s.\n\nOver the years, Christian AC has spawned subgenres including \"Christian hot AC\" (or \"modern Christian AC\"), \"Christian soft AC\" (also known as \"contemporary inspirational\"), \"[[Urban adult contemporary|urban AC]] [[Urban contemporary gospel|gospel]]\" (a softer type of [[urban contemporary gospel]]), and \"[[Contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[Rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]\" (a softer type of [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian]] [[rhythmic contemporary]]). Some stations play only \"Christian hot AC\", \"Christian soft AC\", or only one of the variety of subgenres.

It is defined by death metal’s musical style combined with Christian-themed lyrics, performed by bands whose members identify as Christians. Musically, it remains indistinguishable from traditional death metal, characterized by heavy guitar riffs, blast beats, and guttural vocals. However, the lyrics set it apart, often focusing on Christian concepts such as demons, sin, [[self]] and [[self-denial]], [[Divine retribution|divine judgment]], and apocalypse. The imagery in Christian death metal frequently mirrors or contrasts with that found in secular death metal, which often deals with violent, gory, or anti-Christian themes. Because of this, some critics view Christian death metal as an oxymoron or a surprising juxtaposition, and it has faced resistance from both secular death metal fans and some within the Christian community.\n\nChristian death metal proper formed in the late-1980s to the mid-1990s through the outputs of [[Mortification (band)|Mortification]], [[Vomitorial Corpulence]], and [[Paramaecium]] in Australia, [[Opprobrium (band)|Opprobrium]], [[Living Sacrifice]], and [[Crimson Thorn]] in the United States, [[Sympathy (band)|Sympathy]] in Canada, and the early work of [[Antestor]] in Norway.

It emerged from [[urban contemporary music]] and [[Christian media]] in the United States during the 1980s.\n\nChristian hip-hop music first emerged on record in 1982 with a track entitled \"Jesus Christ (The Gospel Beat)\" by Queens, New York artist McSweet. The first full-length Christian hip-hop album, ''Bible Break'', by Oklahoma artist [[Stephen Wiley]], was released in 1985, with the title track becoming a hit on [[Christian radio]] in 1986. Other early Christian hip recording artists from the mid-1980s included P.I.D. (Preachas in Disguise), who recorded to funky rock rhythms, as well as JC & the Boys and Michael Peace. During the 1990s and 2000s, rapper [[KJ-52]] rose to prominence in the field.\n\n[[Christian rock]] band [[DC Talk]] blended hip-hop and rock, and were successful in mainstream [[Christian music]]. All three band members have had successful independent careers, [[Michael Tait]] and [[Kevin Max|Kevin Max Smith]] in [[Christian pop]], and [[TobyMac]] as a Christian rapper and label owner. Along with [[Lecrae]], [[NF (rapper)|NF]], [[KB (rapper)|KB]] & [[Emcee N.I.C.E.]] who have emerged recently on the mainstream rap scene along with [[American popular music]] figures [[DMX]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Kanye West]]. Outside of the United States, there are Christian rap scenes in the UK, Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Canada. Asian, Black, and Latino rappers are becoming a major part of the genre, and this success is expanding the appeal of both Christian hip-hop and [[Christian electronic dance music|Christian EDM]] within general hip-hop and broader [[popular music]].",

The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal [[subculture]] provides its core members with an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith, although it often does.\n\nChristian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of [[Evangelism|evangelization]] to the wider heavy metal music scene. The genre was pioneered by the American [[Resurrection Band]] and [[Barnabas (band)|Barnabas]], the Swedish [[Jerusalem (Swedish band)|Jerusalem]], and Canadian [[Daniel Band]].{{sfn|Thompson|2000|pp=153–4}} In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as [[Vengeance Rising]], [[Deliverance (metal band)|Deliverance]], [[Believer (band)|Believer]], and [[Tourniquet (band)|Tourniquet]].{{sfn|Moberg|2015|pp=37–8}} Another Christian metal band that was successful during the '80s was American band [[Stryper]], whose album ''[[To Hell with the Devil]]'' sold over two million copies.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Australian [[death metal]] band [[Mortification (band)|Mortification]] rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene.

While there were many smaller bands, ska in the Christian marketplace in the late 1990s came to be primarily represented by three bands: [[The Insyderz]], [[The O. C.

As with third wave ska in the general market the sound was often intermingled with that of [[punk music|punk]], [[swing music|swing]], or [[rockabilly]]. In parallel with mainstream ska, many underground Christian ska bands released one or two ska based albums before completely genre-hopping away from ska or dissolving.

The current style of spelling of the term was not established then and she spelt it as \"Chatnee Soca\". The following year her hit \"Roll up de Tassa\" was instrumental in creating a commercial market for this type of music internationally. Drupatee has spoken about the blending of Afro and Indo melodies and rhythms in songs such as \"Chatnee Soca\" and \"Hotter than ah Chulha\". Chutney is a melody and soca is a beat.

It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's Western-influenced \"[[New Music (Japanese genre)|new music]]\", but came to include a wide range of styles — including [[funk]], [[disco]], [[R&B]], [[Adult-oriented rock (disambiguation)|AOR]], [[soft rock]], and [[boogie (genre)|boogie]] — that were associated with the country's nascent [[economic boom]] and [[leisure class]]. It was also identified with then-new technologies such as the [[Walkman]], cars with built-in [[cassette deck]]s and [[Car stereo|FM stereos]], and various [[electronic musical instruments]].\n\nThere is no unified consensus among scholars regarding the definition of city pop. In Japan, the tag simply referred to music that projected an \"[[urban area#Japan|urban]]\" feel and whose target demographic was urbanites. Many of the artists did not embrace the Japanese influences of their predecessors, and instead largely drew from American funk, soft rock and boogie. Some examples may also feature [[tropical music|tropical]] flourishes or elements taken from [[disco]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Okinawan music|Okinawan]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[Caribbean music]]. Singer-songwriter [[Tatsuro Yamashita]], who was among the genre's pioneers and most successful artists, is sometimes called the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#Y|\"king\" of city pop]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], and early solo albums by YMO members [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Haruomi Hosono]] and [[Yukihiro Takahashi]], are also credited as heavily influencing the styles of mixing and arrangement that became central to the city pop genre.\n\nCity pop lost its mainstream appeal after the 1980s and was derided by younger Japanese generations. In the early 2010s, partly through the influence of music-sharing blogs and Japanese reissues, city pop gained an international online following as well as becoming a touchstone for the sample-based [[microgenre]]s known as [[vaporwave]] and [[future funk]].",

The groups are typically composed of, operated by, and directed by students. In the context of collegiate a cappella, the term ''a cappella'' typically also refers to the [[music genre]] performed by [[pop music|pop-centric]] student singing groups. Consequently, an ensemble that sings unaccompanied classical music may not be considered an a cappella group, even though technically it is performing ''a cappella''.\n\nAccording to the nonfiction book ''Pitch Perfect'', ''[[a cappella]]'' music is one of the oldest forms of music in existence, \"the kind made without any accompaniment at all,\" and descended from the tradition of [[Gregorian chant]]. A cappella music as a form joined this early form with a later Puritan style, known as shape-note singing, which further extended into the American Gospel tradition. Further permutations leaked into the American pop landscape. Today, by some accounts, there exist as many as “twelve hundred collegiate a cappella groups in the United States alone.”",

The genre was created by [[Nemours Jean-Baptiste]] following the creation of Ensemble Aux Callebasses in 1955, which became Ensemble Nemours Jean-Baptiste in 1957. The frequent tours of the many Haitian bands have cemented the style in all the Caribbean. Therefore, compas is the main music of several countries such as [[Dominica]] and the [[French Antilles]]. Whether it is called [[zouk]], where French Antilles artists of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] have taken it, or konpa in places where Haitian artists have toured, this méringue style is influential in part of the [[Caribbean]], [[Portugal]], [[Cape Verde]], [[France]], part of [[Canada]], and [[South America|South]] and [[North America]].\n\nNemours Jean-Baptiste (1918–1985) was an important figure in the creation and popularization of ''konpa dirèk''. Born in Port-au-Prince, Jean-Baptiste grew up in a musically inclined family, and his early exposure to various forms of music shaped his later innovations. In the 1950s, Haiti's music scene was heavily influenced by traditional ''meringue'', but Jean-Baptiste wanted to modernize this sound by incorporating elements of Latin and jazz music, which were becoming popular across the Caribbean at the time. The Ensemble Aux Callebasses, later became the Ensemble Nemours Jean-Baptiste. His ensemble introduced a new style of ''meringue'' with more structured rhythms and harmonic arrangements, characterized by the inclusion of electric guitars, saxophones, and a strong brass section.\n\nCompas blends African, Latin and European influences, reflecting Haiti's cultural heritage resulting from their colonial past. The music's adaptable nature allowed it to break class barriers in Haiti, being embraced by both the elites and working-class communities. As ''konpa'' evolved in the 1960s and 1970s, it began to influence other Caribbean genres like Dominican merengue and zouk in the French Antilles, contributing to its international reach. Jean-Baptiste's contributions established ''konpa'' as a cornerstone of Haitian cultural identity.",

Comparsas are large ensembles of musicians, singers and dancers with a specific costume and choreography which perform in the street carnivals of [[Santiago de Cuba]], Camaguey, and [[Havana]].\n\nThe instrumentation differs between '''''congas santiagueras''''' and '''''congas habaneras'''''. ''Congas santiagueras'' include the ''[[Trompeta china|corneta china]]'' (Chinese [[cornet]]), which is an adaptation of the Cantonese [[suona]] introduced in [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] in 1915, and its percussion section comprises bocúes (similar to African [[ashiko]] drums), the [[quinto (drum)|quinto]] (highest pitched conga drum), galletas and the pilón, as well as [[brake]]s which are struck with metal sticks. ''Congas habaneras'' lack the ''corneta china'' but include trumpets, trombones and saxophones, and they have a different set of percussion instruments: redoblantes ([[side drum]]s), [[bombo criollo|bombo]]s ([[bass drums]]), quinto, tumbadora (the lowest pitched conga drum), and metallic [[idiophone]]s such as [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoon]]s, [[frying pan]]s and [[Rim (wheel)|rims]].\n\nCongas and comparsas have a long history which dates back to the 19th century, with musical traditions being passed down from one generation to the next. The older comparsas are derived from ''cabildos de nación'' or other social groups, whereas the later ones, called ''paseos'', are derived from ''barrios'' (neighbourhoods). The music of the congas has become a genre itself, being introduced into Cuban popular music in the early 20th century by artists such as [[Eliseo Grenet]] and [[Armando Oréfiche|Armando Oréfiche and his Havana Cuban Boys]]. They have been present for decades in the repertoire of many [[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjunto]]s, Cuban [[big band]]s and [[descarga]] ensembles, also having an influence on modern genres such as [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[songo music|songo]].

With its [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|rhythms]], [[Melody|melodies]], and lyrics, Congolese rumba has gained global recognition and remains an integral part of [[Music of Africa|African music heritage]]. In December 2021, it was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|intangible cultural heritage]].\n\nEmerging in the mid-20th century in the urban centers of [[Brazzaville]] and Léopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]]) during the colonial era, the genre's roots can be traced to the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] [[partner dance]] music known as ''maringa'', which was traditionally practiced within the former [[Kingdom of Loango]], encompassing regions of contemporary [[Republic of the Congo]], southern [[Gabon]], and [[Cabinda Province]] of Angola. The style gained prominence in the 1920s–1940s, introducing the advent of the \"[[Dance bar|bar-dancing]]\" culture in Brazzaville and Léopoldville, which incorporated distinctive elements such as a [[bass drum]], a bottle employed as a [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and an [[accordion]] known as ''likembe''. During the mid-1940s and 1950s, the influence of [[Son cubano|Cuban son]] bands transformed ''maringa'' into \"Congolese rumba\", as imported records by [[Sexteto Habanero]], [[Trio Matamoros]], and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were frequently misattributed as \"rumba\". The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of [[soukous]], an urban dance music style that emanated from Congolese rumba, imbuing it with lively rhythms, intricate high-pitched guitar melodies, and large brass and [[polyrhythm]]ic percussion sections.\n\nCongolese rumba is characterized by its distinct [[sébène]] instrumental section, which employs [[arpeggios]], [[Chord (music)|rapid chord]] changes, and melodic [[Ornament (music)|embellishments]]. Notably, the style frequently employs a third guitar known as ''mi-solo'', wherein the [[rhythm guitar]] lays down a basic [[Cyclic form|cyclic pattern]], and the \"''mi-solo'' and [[lead guitar]] create intricate intertwining lines\", with \"mi-solo\" being a \"bridge between the ecstatically high-pitched lead guitar and the low-pitched rhythm guitar\". [[Groove (music)|Groovy]] basslines, catchy rhythms based on [[ostinato]] or looping phrases, and danceable beats are also typical elements of the genre.\n\nThe style has gained widespread popularity in Africa, reaching countries like Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Nigeria, Ghana, South Sudan, Senegal, Burundi, Malawi, and Namibia. Additionally, it has found a following in Europe, particularly in France, Belgium, Germany, and the UK, as well as the US, as a result of touring by Congolese musicians, who have performed at various festivals internationally. Musicians such as [[Paul Kamba]], [[Henri Bowane]], [[Wendo Kolosoy]], [[Manuel d'Oliveira]], [[Léon Bukasa]], [[Franco Luambo|Franco Luambo Makiadi]], [[Le Grand Kallé]], [[Nico Kasanda]], [[Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta]], [[Tabu Ley Rochereau]], [[Sam Mangwana]], [[Papa Noël Nedule]], [[Vicky Longomba]], [[Zaïko Langa Langa]], [[Papa Wemba]], and [[Koffi Olomide]] have made significant contributions to the genre, pushing its boundaries and incorporating modern musical elements.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Contemporary folk music''' refers to a wide variety of genres that emerged in the mid-20th century and afterwards which were associated with [[traditional folk music]]. Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music.  This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. The most common name for this new form of music is also \"folk music\", but is often called \"contemporary folk music\" or \"folk revival music\" to make the distinction. The transition was somewhat centered in the United States and is also called the [[American folk music revival]].  Fusion genres such as [[folk rock]] and others also evolved within this phenomenon. While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, it often shares the same English name, performers and venues as traditional folk music; even individual songs may be a blend of the two.\n\nWhile the [[Romantic nationalism]] of the first folk revival had its greatest influence on [[art music]], the \"second folk revival\" of the later 20th century brought a new genre of [[popular music]] with artists marketed through concerts, recordings and broadcasting. One of the earliest figures in this revival was [[Woody Guthrie]], who sang traditional songs in the 1930s and 1940s as well as composing his own. Other major performers who emerged from the 1940s to the early 1960s included [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Phil Ochs]] and [[Tom Paxton]]. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the folk revival fostered a generation of musicians such as [[Fairport Convention]], [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Donovan]], [[Martin Carthy]], and [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], who achieved initial prominence in the 1960s. The folk revival spawned [[Canada]]'s first folk wave of internationally successful artists such as [[Neil Young]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Joni Mitchell]], and [[Buffy Sainte-Marie]].\n\nThe mid-1960s through the early 1970s was associated with large musical, political, lifestyle, and counterculture changes. Folk music underwent a related rapid evolution, expansion and diversification at that same time. Major changes occurred through the evolution of established performers such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Judy Collins]], and [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], and also through the creation of new fusion genres with rock and pop. During this period, the term \"protest music\" was often used to characterize folk music with topical political themes.  The Canadian performers [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Bruce Cockburn]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] represented such fusions and enjoyed great popularity in the U.S. Starting in the 1970s folk music was fueled by new singer-songwriters such as Joni Mitchell, [[Neil Young]], and [[Harry Chapin]].\n\nOther subgenres of folk include [[anti folk]], [[folk punk]], [[indie folk]], [[folktronica]], [[freak folk]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and fusion genres such as [[folk metal]], [[progressive folk]], [[psychedelic folk]], and [[neofolk]].",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Country folk''' as a genre label is a rather nebulous one, but one that has been employed often at least since the mid-1970s. For dedicated enthusiasts, the category largely includes the works of contemplative post-[[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] singer-songwriters, who were influenced by his and other late 1960s' and 1970s' artists' country rock sounds, but who, recording slightly later, preferred a gentler, more acoustic-dominant sound that allowed focus on the lyrics. The significant element that distinguishes \"country folk\" from the \"folk\" music on Dylan's contemporaries' recordings in the 1960s was the re-admission of country and bluegrass music instrumentation—mandolin, banjo, fiddle, and resophonic and electric steel guitars—into the mix; country rock's success with urban audiences had paved the way for this hybrid. For aficionados, viewing country folk as a subgenre of country is inaccurate, as it is not aimed at a country music audience, in the main.\n\nSome of the definitive country folk artists from the early years include [[Harry McClintock]], [[John Prine]], [[Kate Wolf]], and [[Nanci Griffith]]—all singer-songwriters with thoughtful lyrics whose arrangements are backed by the aforementioned instruments. By the 1980s, record labels such as Rounder and Sugar Hill specialized in recording country folk artists\n\nThe category does overlap with the post-country rock trajectories of other artists who moved away from the mainstream market as country rock's own fortunes waned at the close of the 1970s. [[Emmylou Harris]] moved into neo-traditionalist country, [[Chris Hillman]] into progressive bluegrass, brother harmony duo (with [[Herb Pedersen]]), and Bakersfield revival. By the start of the 1990s, these sounds, as well as others, would inspire musical amalgams categorized as [[alternative country]] music and [[Americana (music)|americana]], yet \"country folk\" continues to be used for the gentler sounds of singers such as [[Iris DeMent]], [[Kate & Anna McGarrigle]], and [[Gillian Welch]].\n\nEven during the 1970s, as the acoustic, early country music-inflected sounds of country folk were making it distinct from other styles of post-1960s singer-songwriter music, it had varying degrees of overlaps with the sounds of progressive country music (such as [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Guy Clark]]), outlaw country ([[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Johnny Cash]]), progressive bluegrass ([[Tony Rice]] albums Cold on the Shoulder and Native American), and other country rock inflected recordings ([[Tom Rush]]'s ''Tom Rush'' and ''Merrimack County'' and [[Gordon Lightfoot]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 1970s catalog). None of these were specifically marketed or received as \"country folk\", however. Still, later low-key, acoustic-dominant country-inflected recordings by these and many other earlier artists have at times loosely, but not inaccurately, been defined as country folk by some sources.\n\nMore recently, the majority of artists whose music could be classified as country folk find their home in the americana genre, including [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Parker Millsap]], [[Patty Griffin]] and [[Amanda Shires]], with several artists being interchangeably described as both folk and americana artists, such as [[Sarah Jarosz]] who has received [[Grammy Awards]] in both genre categories.",

It is characterized by relaxed [[tempo]]s and a lighter tone than that used in the fast and complex [[bebop]] style. Cool jazz often employs formal arrangements and incorporates elements of [[classical music]]. Broadly, the genre refers to a number of post-war jazz styles employing a more subdued approach than that of contemporaneous jazz idioms. As [[Paul Tanner]], Maurice Gerow, and David Megill suggest, \"the tonal sonorities of these conservative players could be compared to [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] colors, while the solos of [[Dizzy Gillespie|[Dizzy] Gillespie]] and his followers could be compared to fiery red colors.\"\n\nThe term ''cool'' started being applied to this music around 1953, when [[Capitol Records]] released the album ''Classics in Jazz: Cool and Quiet''. Mark C. Gridley, writing in the ''[[All Music Guide to Jazz]]'', identifies four overlapping sub-categories of cool jazz:\n\n# \"Soft variants of bebop,\" including the [[Miles Davis]] recordings that constitute ''[[Birth of the Cool]]''; the complete works of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]; the output of [[Gerry Mulligan]], especially his work with [[Chet Baker]] and [[Bob Brookmeyer]]; the music of [[Stan Kenton]]'s sidemen during the late 1940s through the 1950s; and the works of [[George Shearing]] and [[Stan Getz]].\n# The output of modern players who eschewed bebop in favor of advanced [[Swing music|swing]]-era developments, including [[Lennie Tristano]], [[Lee Konitz]], and [[Warne Marsh]]; [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Paul Desmond]]; and performers such as [[Jimmy Giuffre]] and [[Dave Pell]] who were influenced by [[Count Basie]] and [[Lester Young]]'s small-group music.\n# Musicians from either of the previous categories who were active in California from the 1940s through the 1960s, developing what came to be known as [[West Coast jazz]].\n# \"Exploratory music with a subdued effect by [[Teddy Charles]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[John LaPorta]], and their colleagues during the 1950s.\"",

By the mid-1970s, many country artists were transitioning to the pop-country sound, which led to some records charting high on the mainstream [[Contemporary hit radio|top 40]] and the ''Billboard'' country chart. In turn, many pop and [[easy listening]] artists crossed over to country charts during this time. After declining in popularity during the [[neotraditional country|neotraditional]] movement of the 1980s, country pop had a comeback in the 1990s with a sound that drew more heavily on [[pop rock]] and [[adult contemporary]].

Crunk is often up-tempo and one of Southern hip hop's more nightclub-oriented subgenres. Distinguishing itself with other Southern hip hop subgenres, crunk is marked and characterized by its energetic accelerated musical tempo, club appeal, recurrent chants frequently executed in a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] manner, multilayered synths, its pronounced reliance on resounding [[Roland TR-808|808]] basslines, and rudimentary musical arrangement. An archetypal crunk track frequently uses a dominant groove composed of a nuanced utilization of intricately multilayered keyboard synthesizers organized in a recurring pattern, seamlessly shifting from a lower to a higher pitch that encompasses the song's primary central rhythm, both in terms of its harmonic and melodic aspects. The main groove is then wrapped up with looped, stripped-down, and crisp 808 dance claps and manipulated snare rolls coupled and accompanied by a bassline of thumping 808 kick drums. The term \"crunk\" was also used throughout the 2000s as a [[Hypernymy and hyponymy|blanket term]] to denote any style of [[Southern hip-hop]], a side effect of the genre's breakthrough to the mainstream.  The word derives from its [[African-American Vernacular English]] past-[[participle]] form, \"crunk\", of the verb \"to crank\" (as in the phrase \"crank up\"). It refers to being excited or high on drugs.{{citation needed|date=November 2024}}",

Originally, the genre was primarily mid-tempo, making use of metal riffs in a stripped-down anarcho-punk context, however many later bands pushed the genre to be more grandiose, faster or more melodic. Often songs are political, discussing [[environmentalism]], [[anarchism]], [[anti-capitalism]], [[feminism]] and [[animal rights]]. \n\nThe genre originated in the early to mid-1980s with [[Amebix]] and [[Antisect]], bands active in the anarcho-punk scene who began to incorporate the influence of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Hellhammer]], [[Motörhead]] and [[Trouble (band)|Trouble]]. The influence of these bands led to the genre's first wave with [[Hellbastard]], [[Deviated Instinct]] and [[Concrete Sox]]. By the late 1980s, the genre had begun to merge with [[hardcore punk]], typified by [[Electro Hippies]], [[Extreme Noise Terror]] and [[Doom (British band)|Doom]]. During the 1990s, this sound was continued by Swedish and Japanese bands including [[Skitsystem]], [[Driller Killer (band)|Driller Killer]], [[Disclose]] and Gloom, while other areas brought in outside influences such as [[Dystopia (band)|Dystopia]] with sludge metal, [[His Hero is Gone]] with [[powerviolence]], [[Choking Victim]] with [[ska]] and [[Disrupt (band)|Disrupt]] with [[grindcore]]. During the 2000s, the most prominent sound in the genre was the neo-crust style of [[Tragedy (band)|Tragedy]], [[Fall of Efrafa]] and [[From Ashes Rise]], which pushed the genre into more metal-influenced but also melodic and [[post-rock]]-inspired territory. At the same time, Swedish bands like [[Disfear]] and [[Wolfbrigade]] were also pushing crust punk into an increasingly melodic direction, through the incorporation of elements of [[melodic death metal]].",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Rumba''' is a secular genre of [[Cuban music]] involving dance, percussion, and song. It originated in the northern regions of Cuba, mainly in urban [[Havana]] and [[Matanzas]], during the late 19th century. It is based on African music and dance traditions, namely [[Abakuá]] and [[yuka (music)|yuka]], as well as the Spanish-based ''[[coros de clave]]''. According to [[Argeliers León]], rumba is one of the major \"genre complexes\" of Cuban music, and the term '''rumba complex''' is now commonly used by musicologists. This complex encompasses the three traditional forms of rumba (yambú, [[guaguancó]] and columbia), as\nwell as their contemporary derivatives and other minor styles.\n\nTraditionally performed by poor workers of African descent in streets and ''solares'' (courtyards), rumba remains one of Cuba's most characteristic forms of music and dance. Vocal improvisation, elaborate dancing and [[polyrhythm]]ic drumming are the key components of all rumba styles. ''[[Cajón de rumba|Cajones]]'' (wooden boxes) were used as drums until the early 20th century, when they were replaced by ''tumbadoras'' ([[conga drum]]s). During the genre's recorded history, which began in the 1940s, there have been numerous successful rumba bands such as Los Papines, [[Los Muñequitos de Matanzas]], Clave y Guaguancó, AfroCuba de Matanzas and Yoruba Andabo.\n\nSince its early days, the genre's popularity has been largely confined to Cuba, although its legacy has reached well beyond the island. In the United States, it gave its name to the so-called \"ballroom rumba\", or [[rhumba]], and in Africa, [[soukous]] is commonly referred to as \"[[Congolese rumba]]\" (despite being actually based on [[son cubano]]). Its influence in Spain is testified by [[rumba flamenca]] and derivatives such as [[Catalan rumba]].",

The couple performing cumbia dances in a circle around a group of musicians, and it involves the woman holding lit candle(s) in her right hand that she uses to push the man away while she holds her skirt in her left. During the dance, the partners do not touch each other, and the man dances while holding a ''[[sombrero vueltiao]]'' that he tries to put on the woman's head as a representation of amorous conquest. This dance is originally\nmade to depict the battle that the “black man had to fight to conquer an indigenous woman”. The story continues and the dance shows that this leads to a new generation and is depicting the history of the coast of Colombia.\n\nHowever Cumbia is much more than just a dance; it is “practica cultural” (cultural practice). Cumbia is an umbrella term, and much like vallenato there are many subcategories. The subcategories are many like music, dance, rhythm, and genre. The genre aspect can be split into two things; Cumbia is a “ complex mix of genres with a caribbean-colombian air in binaria subdivision” and “a category of music for Colombian music with a Caribbean flavor”.\n\nSince the 1940s, commercial or modern Colombian cumbia had expanded to the rest of [[Latin America]], and many countries have had their own variants of cumbia after which it became popular throughout the Latin American regions, including in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], the [[United States]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]].\n\nMost Hispanic American countries have made their own regional version of Cumbia, some of them with their own particularity.",

Cumbia villera's characteristic sound was created using influences from [[Colombia]]n and [[Peruvian cumbia]], ''cumbia sonidera'' and ''cumbia [[Santa Fe Province|santafesina]]'' in the realm of cumbia, and from [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Argentine folklore]], and [[electronic music]] in other music genres. Lastly, the creator of cumbia villera, [[Pablo Lescano]], admitted that his lyrics were influenced by bands from Argentine [[punk rock]], like [[2 Minutos]] and Argentine rock [[rolinga]], like [[Viejas Locas]]. Over time, the genre has evolved, bands and artists have explored different sounds, and new fusions have arisen, such as [[cumbia rapera]], with [[Bajo Palabra]] mixing cumbia villera with [[hip hop]], and [[tropipunk]], with [[Kumbia Queers]] mixing cumbia villera with [[punk rock|punk]].\n\nFor its characteristics, cumbia villera has been compared to [[gangsta rap]], [[reggaeton]], rock rolinga, [[ragga]]muffin, [[baile funk]], and [[narcocorrido]], among other music genres.",

Initially, dancehall was a more sparse version of [[reggae]] than the [[roots reggae|roots]] style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. This music genre wasn't officially named until the 1980s, when the two words ''Dance'' and ''Hall'' (referring to the common venue) were joined to form ''Dancehall'', which was then promoted internationally for the first time. At that time digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \"[[ragga]]\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of [[Jamaican Patois]] rather than [[Jamaican English|Jamaican standard English]] and a focus on the track instrumentals (or \"[[riddim]]s\").\n\nDancehall saw initial mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s; by the 1990s, it became increasingly popular in [[Jamaican diaspora]] communities. In the 2000s, dancehall experienced worldwide mainstream. By the 2010s, it began to heavily influence the work of established [[Western world|Western]] artists and producers, which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream.{{Music of Jamaica}}",

Dancehall pop is also different from dancehall in that most songs use lesser [[Jamaican Patois]] in lyrics––allowing it to be globally understood and consumed. It also incorporates the key pop music elements of having melodies, hooks, and the verse-chorus format. Additionally, the genre moves away from the [[reggae]] and [[roots reggae]] music origins in social and political protest, now lyrically centering on partying, dancing, and sexuality. By the early 2000s, dancehall pop had its entrance into the global music industry.",

Dangdut is the most popular musical genre in Indonesia and very popular in other [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]n countries because of its melodious instrumentation and vocals. Dangdut features a [[tabla]] and [[gendang]] beat.\n\nSeveral popular dangdut singers include [[Rhoma Irama]], [[Mansyur S.]], [[Elvy Sukaesih]], [[Camelia Malik]] and now [[Iyeth Bustami]], [[Ayu Ting Ting]], [[Lesti Kejora]] and [[Via Vallen]] as Indonesian dangdut [[diva]]s. Their music includes strong Indian music influences as the basis of harmony, theme, and beat. A dangdut musical group typically consists of a lead singer, backed by four to eight musicians. Instruments usually include a [[tabla]], [[gendang]], [[flute]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]]s, [[sitar]], [[drum machine]]s, and [[synthesizer|synthesiser]]s. Modern dangdut incorporates influences from Middle Eastern pop music, Western rock, [[reggae]], [[disco music|disco]], [[contemporary R&B]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[house music|house]], and [[electronic dance music]].\n\nThe popularity of dangdut peaked in the 1970s and 1980s but emerged in the late 1960s. By 2012, it was still largely popular in Western Indonesia, but the genre was becoming less popular in the eastern parts, apart from [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]]. Meanwhile, more regional and faster-paced forms of dangdut (as opposed to slower, Bollywood-influenced dangdut) have risen in popularity.",

The contradanza, which had English and French roots in the [[country dance]] and [[Quadrille|contredanse]], was probably introduced to Cuba by the Spanish, who ruled the island for almost four centuries (1511–1898), contributing many thousands of immigrants.

Danzón went on to interact with 20th century Cuban genres such as [[Son (music)|son]], and through the [[danzón-mambo]] it was instrumental in the development of [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]].",

Its sound features [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beats, [[syncopation|syncopated]] [[bassline]]s, [[string section]]s, [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[horn (musical instrument)|horns]], [[electric piano]]s, [[synthesizer]]s, and electric [[rhythm guitar]]s.\n\n[[Discothèques]], mostly a French invention, were imported to the United States with the opening of [[Le Club]], a members-only restaurant and nightclub at 416 East 55th Street in [[Manhattan]], by French expatriate [[Olivier Coquelin]], on New Year's Eve 1960.\n\nDisco music originated from music popular with [[African-American culture|African Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Cultural matters|Latino Americans]], and [[Italian Americans#Influence on American culture and society|Italian Americans]] in [[New York City]] (especially [[Brooklyn]]) and [[Philadelphia]] from the late [[1960s in music|1960s]] to the mid-to-late 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] to both the dominance of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music. Several dance styles developed during '70s disco's popularity in the United States, including \"the [[Bump (dance)|Bump]]\", \"the [[Hustle (dance)|Hustle]]\", \"the Watergate\", \"the Continental\", and \"the Busstop\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, disco music developed, mainly by artists from the United States and [[Eurodisco|Europe]]. Well-known artists included the [[Bee Gees]], [[ABBA]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], [[Baccara]], [[George Michael]], [[The Jacksons]], [[George Benson]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[The O'Jays|The O’Jays]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Boney M]], [[Earth Wind & Fire]], [[Irene Cara]], [[Rick James]], [[ELO]], [[Average White Band]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[The Commodores]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], [[Thelma Houston]], [[Sister Sledge]], [[Sylvester (singer)|Sylvester]], [[The Trammps]], [[Barry White]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Kool & the Gang]], and [[Village People]]. While performers gained public attention, [[record producer]]s played an important behind-the-scenes role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco scenes, and [[DJ]]s would [[audio console|mix]] dance records at clubs like [[Studio 54]] in [[Manhattan]], popular among [[celebrity|celebrities]]. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, mainly loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. The disco scene also had a thriving [[club drug|drug]] [[subculture]], particularly drugs that enhanced the experience of dancing to loud music and flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]] and [[quaaludes]], so common in the disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with [[promiscuity]], reflecting the [[sexual revolution]] of the era. Films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977) and ''[[Thank God It's Friday (film)|Thank God It's Friday]]'' (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\n\nDisco declined as a major popular music trend in the United States after the infamous [[Disco Demolition Night]] on July 12, 1979, and continued its sharp decline in the U.S. during the early [[1980s in music|1980s]]. However, it remained popular in [[Italo-disco|Italy]] and some European countries throughout the 1980s, also gaining popularity elsewhere, including [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], where disco aspects blended with regional folk styles like ''[[ghazal]]s'' and [[Belly dance|belly dancing]]. Disco eventually became a key influence in the development of [[electronic dance music]], [[house music]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[dance-punk]], and [[post-disco]]. The style has seen several revivals since the [[1990s in music|1990s]], with its influence remaining strong across American and European pop music. A revival, underway since the early [[2010s in music|2010s]], gained great popularity in the early [[2020s in music|2020s]]. Albums contributing to this revival include ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', ''[[Random Access Memories]]'', ''[[Future Nostalgia]]'', and [[Kylie Minogue]]'s'' [[Disco (Kylie Minogue album)|Disco]]''. Modern artists like [[Dua Lipa]], [[Lizzo]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]], [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Silk Sonic]] continue the genre's popularity, introducing it to a younger generation.",

Dominican dembow is characterized by its use of a sped-up [[Dembow|dembow rhythm]] as its core percussion element (while standard reggaeton employs the same rhythm at a slower [[tempo]]). The name dembow is credited to the  [[Shabba Ranks]] song [[Dem Bow]] which was remixed by [[Wisin Y Yandel]] and many others and the [[Dembow beat]] became a staple in the reggaeton community.  \n\nThe subgenre diverged from early reggaeton during the 2000s. During this time, Puerto Rican reggaeton was evolving to become more melodic, polished, and lyrically romantic, and would eventually become the basis for most reggaeton music today. However, the \"softening process\" marginalized the scene in the Dominican Republic, which retained a rawer, unembellished, and more aggressive sound. A simultaneous shift towards faster tempos may have also been influenced by the country's \"historical preference\" for the fast-paced [[Merengue music|merengue]] genre.\n\nDominican dembow ultimately spread its influence beyond the Dominican Republic to countries like [[Spain]], the [[United States]], [[Chile]], and [[Italy]]. It came to be known globally as a result of the general growing popularity of [[Spanish-language music]] in the 2010s. During this same decade [[trap music]] began to influence the production style of Dominican dembow.\n\nDominican dembow artists are known as ''dembowseros.'' Notable ''dembowseros'' include [[Tokischa]], [[Chimbala]], [[El Alfa]], and [[Rochy RD]]. Non-Dominican artists have also occasionally produced songs in this style, such as [[Bad Bunny]] with his hit song \"[[Tití Me Preguntó]]\".",

It is sonically similar to the [[trap music|trap]] subgenre and lyrically similar to the [[gangsta rap]] subgenre. Drill [[lyricism]] is noted for its ominous, [[confrontation]]al nature, often including references to [[Gang#Violence|gang rivalries]] and various incidents, sometimes [[murder]], although the subgenre is thematically broader. Drill artists often address authentic, real-life conflicts, at times incorporating artistic expressions such as bravado, taunting or mockery.\n\nEarly drill artists are typically noted for their associations with [[crime in Chicago]], especially with the [[Black Disciples]] and [[Gangster Disciples]]. The genre garnered  mainstream attention in 2012 following the success of pioneering [[Chicago hip-hop|Chicago rappers]] like [[Chief Keef]], [[Lil Durk]], [[Lil Reese]], [[Fredo Santana]], [[G Herbo]], [[Lil Bibby]], [[King Louie (rapper)|King Louie]], [[FBG Duck]] and producer [[Young Chop]]. Other rappers, such as [[Murder of Joseph J. Coleman|Lil JoJo]], S. Dot, Edai, L'A Capone, RondoNumbaNine, Lil Mister, SD and producer Leek-E-Leek also contributed to the early drill scene. Additionally, [[DJ]]'s including DJ Kenn Aon and DJ Hustlenomics were conducive to the subgenre's early growth. Female rappers such as [[Sasha Go Hard]], [[Katie Got Bandz]], and the group Pretty N Pink developed the distinctive feminine style of drill music.\n\nChicago drill saw a resurgence in the mainstream during the late 2010s and early 2020s with artists such as [[King Von]], [[Polo G]], [[Calboy]], [[FBG Duck]] and a revamped [[Lil Durk]]. By the 2020s, drill's popularity spread globally, with the [[BBC]] in 2021 describing drill as \"the sound of the global youth\". The [[UK drill]] scene emerged in the mid-2010s, leading to the prominence of artists such as [[67 (rap group)|67]], [[Harlem Spartans]], [[CGM (rap group)|CGM]], and [[Skengdo x AM]]. UK drill subsequently influenced regional scenes in Europe and America, including [[Brooklyn drill]], which gained mainstream popularity in the early 2020s with artists like [[Pop Smoke]] and [[Fivio Foreign]]. Drill scenes have been noted in such locales as [[Irish rap#Grime/drill|Ireland]], [[Australian hip-hop#Drill music|Australia]], [[Dutch hip-hop|the Netherlands]], [[Gh hip-hop|Ghana]], [[African hip-hop#Uganda|Uganda]], [[European hip-hop#Northern Europe|Denmark]] and [[French hip-hop|France]].\n\nThe subgenre's controversial nature has stimulated discussion. Public debate about the implications drill rap has raged, while some authorities, elected officials, and commentators in the UK and America castigate the genre and its artists, claiming that drill rap catalyzes real world violence. On the other hand, it has been counterargued that drill illuminates harsh societal realities, resonating closely with the disenfranchised youth audience, and that artists are within their [[Freedom of speech|right to self-expression]]. Attempts at curtailing the subgenre, including deleting posted music videos, blockading performances, and legalizing song lyrics as criminal evidence, have been put in practice in the UK and America, generating further controversy.",

The genre grew out of the UK's [[Jungle music|jungle]] scene in the 1990s. \n\nThe popularity of drum and bass at its commercial peak ran parallel to several other UK dance styles. A major influence was the original Jamaican [[dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]] sound that influenced [[Jungle music|jungle]]'s bass-heavy sound. Another feature of the style is the complex [[syncopation]] of the drum tracks' [[break (music)|breakbeat]]. Drum and bass subgenres include [[breakcore]], [[ragga jungle]], [[hardstep]], [[darkstep]], [[techstep]], [[neurofunk]], ambient drum and bass, [[liquid funk]] (also known as liquid drum and bass), jump up, drumfunk, [[sambass]], and [[drill 'n' bass]].

Major international music labels had shown very little interest in the drum and bass scene until [[BMG Rights Management]] acquired [[Ram Records (UK)|RAM]] in February 2016. Since then, the genre has seen a significant growth in exposure.

It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of [[remix]]es of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the [[rhythm section]] (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a [[riddim]]), the application of studio effects such as [[Delay (audio effect)|echo]] and [[reverb effect|reverb]], and the occasional [[dubbing (music)|dubbing]] of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.\n\n\nDub was pioneered by [[Audio engineer|recording engineers]] and producers such as [[King Tubby|Osbourne \"King Tubby\" Ruddock]], [[Scientist (musician)|Hopeton \"Scientist\" Brown]], [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]], [[Errol Thompson (audio engineer)|Errol Thompson]] and others beginning in the late 1960s. [[Augustus Pablo]], who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding [[melodica]] to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers [[Clive Chin]] and [[Herman Chin Loy]]. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the [[mixing console]] as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The [[Roland Space Echo]] was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects. \n\nDub has influenced many genres of music, including [[rock music|rock]], most significantly the subgenre of [[post-punk]] and other kinds of [[punk rock|punk]], [[pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-disco]], and later [[house music|house]], [[techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[electronic dance music]], and [[trip hop]]. Dub was a basis for the genres of [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], as well as a major influence on [[dubstep]], with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as [[Mad Professor]] continue to produce new material.",

The term \"Dub Poetry\" was coined by Dub artist [[Linton Kwesi Johnson]] in 1976, and further popularized by artist [[Oku Onuora|Oku Onoura]], which consists of [[spoken word]] over reggae rhythms, originally found on the backing or \"version\" side of a 12 or 7 inch [[vinyl record]].\n\nUnlike [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]] (also known as toasting), which also features the use of the spoken word, the dub poet's performance is normally prepared, rather than the [[extemporized]] chat of the [[dancehall]] dee jay.

[[Musicality]] is built into dub poems, yet dub poets generally perform without backing music, delivering chanted speech with pronounced rhythmic accentuation and dramatic stylization of gesture. Sometimes dub music effects such as echo and reverb are dubbed spontaneously by a poet into live versions of a poem. Many dub poets also employ [[call-and-response]] devices to engage audiences.",

The style emerged as a [[UK garage]] offshoot that blended [[2-step garage|2-step]] rhythms and sparse [[dub reggae|dub]] production, as well as incorporating elements of [[broken beat]], [[grime (music genre)|grime]], and [[drum and bass]]. In the United Kingdom, the origins of the genre can be traced back to the growth of the Jamaican [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound system]] party scene in the early 1980s.\n\nDubstep is generally characterised by the use of [[syncopation|syncopated]] rhythmic [[Drum pattern|patterns]], with prominent [[Bass (sound)|bass]]lines, and a dark tone. In 2001, this underground sound and other strains of garage music began to be showcased and promoted at London's night club Plastic People, at the \"Forward\" night (sometimes stylised as FWD>>), and on the [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] station [[Rinse FM]], which went on to be considerably influential to the development of dubstep. The term \"dubstep\" in reference to a genre of music began to be used by around 2002 by [[Record label|labels]] such as [[Big Apple Records|Big Apple]] and [[Tempa Recordings|Tempa]], by which time stylistic trends used in these remixes became more noticeable and distinct from 2-step and [[Grime music|grime]].\n\nA very early supporter of the sound was [[BBC Radio&nbsp;1]] DJ [[John Peel]], who started playing it from 2003 onwards. In 2004, the last year of his show, a listeners vote included songs by [[Distance (musician)|Distance]], [[Digital Mystikz]], and [[Plastician]] as the top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to enter mainstream [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British popular culture]] when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the [[Internet]] and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' and online publications such as ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', with a regular feature entitled ''The Month In: Grime/Dubstep''. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ [[Mary Anne Hobbs]] started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006.\n\nTowards the end of the 2000s and into the early 2010s, the genre started to become more commercially successful in the UK, with more singles and remixes entering the music charts. Music journalists and critics also noticed a dubstep influence in several pop artists' work. Around this time, producers also began to fuse elements of the original dubstep sound with other influences, creating fusion genres including [[future garage]] and the slower and more experimental [[post-dubstep]].

The scene was exclusive, creating boundaries around itself and incorporating only those it deemed \"true\" or committed. Musical integrity was paramount, and artists sought to maintain black metal's [[Underground music|underground]] status.\n\nIn August 1993, several of its members were arrested, and in May 1994, they were convicted of arson, murder, assault, and possession of explosives, most notably [[Varg Vikernes]] for the murder of [[Euronymous]]. Most showed no remorse for their actions at the time.

Unlike its boogie predecessor, which emphasized vocal elements, electro focused more on rhythm and machine-generated sound.\n\nThe genre arose as the popularity of [[disco]] waned in the U.S., blending [[funk]] and early [[hip hop]] elements with influences from New York's boogie scene and electronic pop from Germany and Japan. Foundational artists in the electro movement include [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Warp 9]], and [[Hashim Music|Hashim]]. Pioneering tracks like \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" (1982) and \"[[Nunk (song)|Nunk]]\" (1982) established the genre’s signature sound.\n\nElectro reached peak popularity in the early 1980s. However, the genre began to shift by the mid-decade, incorporating harder beats and rock elements, as seen in the work of groups like [[Run DMC]]. After a period of decline, a revival emerged in the late 1990s led by artists such as [[Anthony Rother]] and DJs like [[Dave Clarke (DJ)|Dave Clarke]]. A third wave of interest surfaced around 2007.\n\nToday, electro continues to evolve through numerous subgenres and fusion styles, maintaining its legacy as a foundational pillar of modern electronic dance music.",

[[Kurtis Mantronik]]'s electro-soul productions for [[Joyce Sims]] presaged [[new jack swing]]'s combination of hip hop and soul elements. In a 2016 profile on the genre's rise in Denver's music scene, Dylan Owens of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' writes, \"As with all fledgling genres, little about electro-soul is defined — even what to call it. (Of the eight artists interviewed for this article, none agreed on any one name.) But what does seem sure is its rise, especially locally. If Denver can be known as the musical torchbearer of any genre, it's electro-soul's half-live, half-produced swirl of hip-hop, soul, funk and jazz.\"\n\n\"[[No Self Control (Peter Gabriel song)|No Self Control]]\" by [[Peter Gabriel]], taken from his [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|1980 self-titled album]], has been described as electro-soul, fused with [[art rock]].",

It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means ([[electroacoustic music]]). Pure electronic instruments depend entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an [[electronic oscillator]], [[theremin]], or [[synthesizer]]: no [[acoustic wave]]s need to be previously generated by mechanical means and then converted into electrical signals. On the other hand, electromechanical instruments have mechanical parts such as strings or hammers that generate the sound waves, together with electric elements including [[pickup (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], [[power amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s that convert the acoustic waves into electrical signals, process them and convert them back into sound waves. Such electromechanical devices include the [[telharmonium]], [[Hammond organ]], [[electric piano]] and [[electric guitar]].\n\nThe first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic [[tape music]] in the 1940s in Egypt and France. [[Musique concrète]], created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and [[algorithmic composition]] with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.\n\nDuring the 1960s, digital [[computer music]] was pioneered, innovation in [[live electronics]] took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the [[music industry]]. In the early 1970s, [[Moog synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on [[popular music]], with the adoption of [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s, [[electronic drum]]s, drum machines, and [[Turntablism|turntables]], through the emergence of genres such as [[disco]], [[krautrock]], [[New wave music|new wave]], [[synth-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic dance music]] (EDM). In the early 1980s, mass-produced [[digital synthesizer]]s such as the [[Yamaha DX7]] became popular, and [[MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the [[Love Parade]] became the largest street party with over 1&nbsp;million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.\n\nContemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from [[Experimental music|experimental art music]] to popular forms such as electronic dance music. In recent years, electronic music has gained popularity in the Middle East, with artists from Iran and Turkey blending traditional instruments with ambient and techno influences. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.",

It emerged as a style of [[hardcore punk]] and {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]]}} from the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} [[Washington, D.C., hardcore]] scene, where it was known as '''emotional hardcore''' or '''emocore'''. The bands [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]], among others, pioneered the genre. In the early-to-mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]], [[punk rock]], and [[pop-punk]] bands, including [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]], [[Cap'n Jazz]], [[Mineral (band)|Mineral]], and [[Jimmy Eat World]]. By the {{nowrap|mid-1990s,}} [[Braid (band)|Braid]], [[the Promise Ring]], and [[the Get Up Kids]] emerged from [[Midwest emo]], and several [[independent record label]]s began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, [[screamo]], a more aggressive style of emo using [[screamed vocals]], also emerged, pioneered by the [[San Diego]] bands [[Heroin (band)|Heroin]] and [[Antioch Arrow]]. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Story of the Year]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[the Used]], and [[Underoath]].\n\nOften seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior. Emo fashion includes [[Slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], black [[Eye liner|eyeliner]], tight {{nowrap|t-shirt}}s with band names, studded belts, and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long [[Bangs (hair)|bangs]]. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as \"emo kids\" or \"emos\". The emo subculture was stereotypically associated with [[social alienation]], sensitivity, [[misanthropy]], [[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]], and [[angst]]. Purported links to [[depression (mood)|depression]], {{nowrap|[[self-harm]]}}, and [[suicide]], combined with its rise in popularity in the early 2000s, inspired a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against emo, with some bands, including [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[Panic! at the Disco]], rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it. There has long been controversy over which bands are labeled \"emo\", especially for bands that started outside traditional emo scenes; a viral website, [[Is This Band Emo?]], was created to address one fan's opinion on this question.\n\nEmo and its subgenre [[emo pop]] entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and [[Dashboard Confessional]], and many artists signed [[contract]]s with [[major record labels]]. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, [[AFI (band)|AFI]], [[Fall Out Boy]], and [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some emo bands changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground [[emo revival]] emerged, with some bands, such as [[the World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die]] and [[Modern Baseball (band)|Modern Baseball]], drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called [[emo rap]] became mainstream; its most famous artists included [[Lil Peep]], [[XXXTentacion]], and [[Juice Wrld]].",

Acts like [[Touché Amoré]], [[La Dispute (band)|La Dispute]] and [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]] drew from 1990s emo and especially its heavier counterparts, such as [[screamo]] and [[post-hardcore]].\n\nThe movement had become prominent in underground music by the mid-2010s, with influential releases from era-defining groups like [[Modern Baseball]], [[the Hotelier]] and [[Joyce Manor]].

But even that information was frequently modified within the generational transmission process that made it reach us today.\"\n\nAlthough the origins are difficult to trace, today fado is commonly regarded as simply a form of song which can be about anything, but must follow a certain traditional structure. In popular belief, fado is a form of music characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor, and infused with a sense of resignation, fate and melancholy. This is loosely captured by the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''[[saudade]]'', or longing, symbolizing a feeling of loss (a permanent, irreparable loss and its consequent lifelong damage). This is similar to the character of several musical genres in Portuguese ex-colonies such as [[Morna (music)|morna]] from [[Cape Verde]], which may be historically linked to fado in its earlier form and have retained its rhythmic heritage. This connection to the music of a historic Portuguese urban and maritime [[proletariat]] (sailors, bohemians, dock workers, prostitutes, taverna frequenters, port traders, fishwives and other [[working-class]] people) can also be found in Brazilian [[modinha]] and Indonesian [[kroncong]], although all these music genres subsequently developed their own independent traditions.\n\nSome famous singers of fado, of which there are many, include [[Alfredo Marceneiro]], [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Mariza]], [[António Zambujo]], and [[Camané]]. On 27 November 2011, fado was added to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]]. It is one of two Portuguese music traditions part of the lists, the other being [[Cante Alentejano]].\n\nModern fado is popular in Portugal, and has been performed by many renowned [[List of fado musicians|musicians]].",

It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band [[Subway to Sally]] spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as [[medieval metal]].

      "wikitext_description": "The terms ''folk music'', ''folk song'', and ''[[folk dance]]'' are comparatively recent expressions. They are extensions of the term ''[[folklore]]'', which was coined in 1846 by the English [[antiquarian]] [[William Thoms]] to describe \"the traditions, customs, and [[superstition]]s of the uncultured classes\". The term further derives from the German expression ''[[Volk]]'', in the sense of \"the people as a whole\" as applied to popular and national music by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and the German Romantics over half a century earlier. Though it is understood that folk music is the music of the people, observers find a more precise definition to be elusive. Some do not even agree that the term folk music should be used. Folk music may tend to have certain characteristics but it cannot clearly be differentiated in purely musical terms. One meaning often given is that of \"old songs, with no known composers,\" another is that of music that has been submitted to an evolutionary \"process of [[Oral tradition|oral transmission]]... the fashioning and re-fashioning of the music by the community that give it its folk character.\"\n\nSuch definitions depend upon \"(cultural) processes rather than abstract musical types...\", upon \"''continuity'' and ''oral transmission''...seen as characterizing one side of a cultural [[dichotomy]], the other side of which is found not only in the lower layers of feudal, capitalist and some oriental societies but also in 'primitive' societies and in parts of 'popular cultures'\". One widely used definition is simply \"Folk music is what the people sing.\"\n\nFor Scholes, as well as for [[Cecil Sharp]] and [[Béla Bartók]], there was a sense of the music of the country as distinct from that of the town. Folk music was already, \"...seen as the authentic expression of a way of life now past or about to disappear (or in some cases, to be preserved or somehow revived),\" particularly in \"a community uninfluenced by art music\" and by commercial and printed song. Lloyd rejected this in favor of a simple distinction of economic class yet for him, true folk music was, in [[Charles Seeger]]'s words, \"associated with a lower class\" in culturally and socially stratified societies. In these terms, folk music may be seen as part of a \"schema comprising four musical types: 'primitive' or 'tribal'; 'elite' or 'art'; 'folk'; and 'popular'.\"\n\nMusic in this genre is also often called ''traditional music.'' Although the term is usually only descriptive, in some cases people use it as the name of a genre. For example, the [[Grammy Award]] previously used the terms \"traditional music\" and \"traditional folk\" for folk music that is not contemporary folk music. Folk music may include most [[indigenous music]].",

The term \"folk rock\" was initially used in the U.S. [[Music journalism|music press]] in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music.\n\nThe commercial success of the Byrds' [[cover version]] of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\" and their debut [[album]] [[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|of the same name]], along with Dylan's own recordings with rock instrumentation—on the albums ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' (1965), ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' (1965), and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'' (1966)—encouraged other folk acts, such as [[Simon & Garfunkel]], to use electric backing on their records and new groups, such as [[Buffalo Springfield]], to form. Dylan's controversial appearance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] on 25 July 1965, where he was backed by an electric band, was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre.\n\nDuring the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic [[British folk rock]] style was created by [[Pentangle (band)|Pentangle]], [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Alan Stivell]]. Inspired by British [[psychedelic folk]] and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of [[the Albion Band]] and [[Celtic rock]].\n{{toclimit|3}}",

It is diametrically opposed to bhangra music in that it is not live music but instead relies on pre-recorded musical parts with only the vocals being sung live along to a live repetitive dhol drum.  The pre-recorded music consists of primarily looped rhythm parts from both eastern and western percussion instruments and little to no melody on instruments.  It borrows heavily from hip hop, however it is more traditional than its predecessor, [[Bhangra (music)|bhangra]] which rebelled against tradition and authenticity.  Traditional folk instruments like [[dhol]] and [[tumbi]] are central to folkhop productions. Folkhop songs tend to be heavily produced by DJs on computer software.  In the beginning, all songs start out as vocal only recordings that the folk singer records in India.  This 'vocal only' recording is then sold on websites involved in the buying and selling of folkhop music.  The DJs then pay a small sum for the rights to these vocals, and then set the music using looped samples of both hip hop and traditional folk instruments.  The quintessential folkhop artist is the bedroom DJ. \nFolkhop albums typically feature no credits on musicians, instead liner notes simply feature 'big ups' to online friends of the folkhop DJ.\n\nWhereas bhangra music was centered on bands delivering live performances with focus on instrumentation (as evidenced by bhangra videos), folkhop shares with rap and hip hop \"common textual aspects, as well as similarities in their onstage and video performance practices: an obsession with materialism, or an expressed desire or boasting of \"bling\", in the form of jewelry, wealth or clothing\"\n\nIt also features an obsession with farming and rural lifestyle such as livestock, tractors traditional clothes etc.  Many folkhop videos\nshowcase rappers and folk singers in the midst of farms or riding on tractors.",

      "wikitext_description": "In contrast with Britain, Japan, according to [[Mike Paradinas]], did not hesitate to appropriate western subcultures in their entirety, and that was the reason why in Japan footwork/juke sprung to become, over the 2010s, one of the dominant electronic dance music genres, paired with the burgeoning footwork dancing scene, with competitions and tournaments.\n\nDJ Fulltono from [[Osaka]] is credited as a first notable pioneer of footwork/juke in [[Japan]]. He started bringing footwork/juke into his mixes around 2008, two years prior to the release of the first compilation from ''Bangs and Works'' series on [[Planet Mu]], and at the time, the dominant types of [[electronic dance music]] in Japan were [[house music|house]] and [[techno]] timing at around 120 to 130 [[Beats per minute|BPM]], and [[drum'n'bass]], at around 170–175 BPM, so at first dancing crowds in Japan were confused and deemed footwork as \"too fast\" for their palate. However, with time they have built tolerance to the DJ sounds of DJ Fulltono. It took Japanese producers and listeners almost a decade to adapt to juke, but around 2018 the footwork scene of Japan was noted to be among the most vibrant electronic dance music scenes in the country, incorporating disparate additional influences into sound, such as [[vocaloid]]s, [[Otaku|otaku culture]], [[Japanese rock]], [[reggae]], [[funk]], [[chiptune music]] and [[wonky music]], thus innovating in the genre.\n\nAnother notable influence on the formation of Japanese footwork/juke scene was Japanese [[ghettotech]] scene, movement led by DJ April and DJ Go, among others. DJ Fulltono, apart from being footwork pioneer in Japan, was (and continues to be) an important DJ in Japanese ghettotech scene as well, around the time he started popularizing footwork in Japan.\n\nThe first Japanese juke [[Music label|label]], called ''Booty Tune'' was set up by DJ Fulltono in 2008, initially to release his own tracks, but gradually became an imprint under which other domestic juke artists started to release their tracks. After that, more Japanese footwork labels appeared, namely ''Japanese Mutation Bootyism'' (which released important ''Japanese Juke and Footworks Compilation''), ''Kool Switch Works'' and ''Dubliminal Bounce'' (by Japanese footwork producer Skip Club Orchestra).\n\nThe scene in Japan received support from Chicago scene on several occasions. Many founding fathers of juke toured Japan, many of the events were as well organized by DJ Fulltono. Most Japanese footwork producers who were interviewed by [[Bandcamp]] named footwork producer Traxman from Chicago and ''Bangs and Works'' as their primary sources of inspiration. In return, Traxman released a full album of remixes of his tracks, where remixes were made exclusively by Japanese [[Music producer|producers]].\n\nIn 2018, [[Thump (Vice)|THUMP]] released a video [[documentary]] on Japanese juke and footwork scene.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}",

      "wikitext_description": "In Europe, juke has been popular in European clubs, particularly in [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Spain]] for years. UK label [[Planet Mu]]'s compilations ''Bangs and Works Volume 1'' (2010) and ''Bangs and Works Volume 2'' (2011) have brought the work of Chicago DJs to a wider audience, drawing some media attention and becoming the first internationally recognized juke compilations. The liner notes for ''Vol. 1'' noted:\n\n{{cquote|Footwork is a hyper rhythmic, abstract dance music, pitched around 160bpm, that largely consists of a template of cut-up samples and phrases that are twisted into repetitive rhythms & shapes, to offbeat, syncopated drum machine patterns and pumping sub-bass lines.<ref name=bangsandworkslinernotes/>}}\n\nApart from ''Bangs and Works'', Planet Mu has also been releasing original albums by Chicago footwork artists, for example ''Da Trax Anthology'' by DJ Nate (2010), which are oftentimes sourced from shelved tracks from the 2000s [[Myspace]] and [[imeem|imeem.com]] era.\n\nThe [[Hyperdub]] label has been a supporter of juke music, releasing much of [[DJ Rashad]]'s material.\nDeeon has released two projects on the famous French Ghetto music label Booty Call Records in 2013\n\nThe early attempt to emulate juke sound in Europe was the infamous \"Footcrab\" by [[Addison Groove]], coming out in 2010 on [[Loefah]]'s ''SWAMP 81'' label. \"Footcrab\" took inspiration from footwork, however the sound of \"Footcrab\" was slowed down to match the tempo of [[UK bass]] genres, around 140 BPM. \"Footcrab\" drew some criticism to be parting ways from the raw nature of juke roots in Chicago and only emulating the sound of juke on a \"child-like\" surface level and the production on \"Footcrab\" was deemed \"cheap\". Notwithstanding the criticism, \"Footcrab\" put Addison Groove on forefront of the UK Bass scene in the [[United Kingdom]]. His subsequent full-length album called ''Transistor Rhythm'' released on Modeselector's ''50 Weapons'' label, while retaining the influence of footwork, shifted more to the earlier days of the genre and to the sound of its immediate predecessor, ghetto house, including [[rave]]y synths at much slower tempos that footwork, around 120–140 BPM. However, the album was also met with mixed to negative reviews.\n\n\nApart from isolated releases like those by [[Addison Groove]] and handful of others, footwork/juke did not meet wide native acceptance in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Mike Paradinas]], the head of [[Planet Mu]] label explained this  by making two points: first, in his words, was that British party culture is markedly different – relying on [[Illegal drugs|illegal substances]] and [[Alcoholic drink|drinking]] – it would have hard time to catch on rather athletic footwork dancing, and second, in his words, is that historically British artists were generally reluctant to appropriate whole cultures, instead trying to either make their own domestic trends or to add a distinct spin to an existing culture, the thing that did not happen to footwork in Britain.",

      "wikitext_description": "Creole folk songs originated from the enslaved Black population of Louisiana. These songs dealt with secular themes and were sung in a patois that reflected their grammatical syntax, instrumentation, musical style, and African heritage. Early in the history of the colony, shortly after the founding of New Orleans in 1718, slaves were permitted to gather for Sunday recreation in a plain on the edge of the city. Eventually the latter gathering place became known as Place Congo or [[Congo Square]]. There the blacks performed their dances and sang, accompanied by instruments made from whatever was at hand. [[Lullaby|Lullabies]] also have been handed down from the Creoles. Until this century the need to collect and preserve these songs was often not understood, but in the 1920s an effort was begun to include Cajun and Creole songs in American folk music. The people whose ancestors created the music are among those making an effort to preserve it.\n\nAfro-French people also created a form of French music called [[zydeco]]. Both Cajun and zydeco music are intended for dancing, which shared background associated with bals de maison (house dances). Despite segregation, Creoles shared many songs with their Cajun neighbours, and the Cajun and Creole traditions have long borrowed from each other.\n\nMusic remains vibrant in modern French Louisiana culture and beyond. Traditional [[house dance]]s and community dance clubs are important venues for music performance. Zydeco emerged from Black Creole dance music in rural areas of Louisiana and provides a way for musicians and dancers to fully articulate the deprivations of poverty with intelligence, artistry, and style.\n\nThese musics have been influenced by other music styles, such as [[Western swing]], [[rock and roll]], and [[country music]], as well as blues and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Swamp pop|swamp-pop]], [[reggae]], [[Rapping|rap]] and [[hip-hop]].\n\nZydeco is also a hybrid. Zydeco players merge the past and present in a sound that still attracts young dancers. For example, Corey Ledet's  album, ''Accordion Dragon'', features unique band arrangements and includes lush, urbane horn arrangements that are rarely heard on zydeco waltzes but which work quite well. [[Beau Jocque]] mixed zydeco with classic rock and hip-hop, and [[Keith Frank]] has picked up Beau Jocque’s synthesis of zydeco and hip-hop.\n\nBlack French music's listeners constitute a worldwide audience, and their distinctive sounds are part of an important ethnic music. Zydeco is heard at music clubs and festivals around the world. The visibility of zydeco increased in the 1980s when [[Queen Ida]], [[Clifton Chenier]], and [[Rockin' Sidney|Rockin’ Sidney]] each won [[Grammy Awards|Grammy awards]]. Rockin’ Sidney’s recording [[My Toot-Toot|''My Toot Toot'']] became an international novelty hit, and movies such as ''[[The Big Easy (film)|The Big Easy]]'' introduced zydeco sounds to new audiences.\n\nFestivals held in [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte]], [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]], and New Orleans contribute to the perpetuation of this culture. Live Cajun music may be heard at local festivals like the annual [[Festivals Acadiens et Créoles]] or the Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival. The “trail ride” culture associated with zydeco, where horseback riders take to the prairies on Sunday afternoons in a winding procession that culminates in an outdoor dance, represents a modern tradition.\n\nAlthough the fluency in southwestern Louisiana’s vernacular French continues to decline, young Cajun songwriters continue to compose in French and add original songs to the repertoire. The number of [[jazz]] musicians who have recorded folk songs and other pieces in Creole shows the continuing use of the language by recent musicians.",

It deemphasizes [[melody]] and [[chord progressions]] and focuses on a strong rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]] of a [[bassline]] played by an [[electric bass]]ist and a drum part played by a [[drum kit|percussionist]], often at slower tempos than other popular music. Funk typically consists of a complex percussive groove with [[Rhythm section|rhythm instruments]] playing interlocking grooves that create a \"hypnotic\" and \"danceable\" feel. It uses the same richly colored [[extended chord]]s found in [[bebop]] jazz, such as [[minor chord]]s with added sevenths and elevenths, and [[dominant seventh]] chords with altered ninths and thirteenths.\n\nFunk originated in the mid-1960s, with [[James Brown]]'s development of a signature groove that emphasized the [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]]—with a heavy emphasis on the first beat of every [[Bar (music)|measure]] (\"The One\"), and the application of swung [[16th note]]s  and [[syncopation]] on all basslines, drum patterns, and guitar riffs. Rock- and [[psychedelia]]-influenced musicians [[Sly and the Family Stone]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] fostered more eclectic examples of the genre beginning in the late 1960s. Other musical groups developed Brown's innovations during the 1970s and the 1980s, including [[Kool and the Gang]], [[Ohio Players]], [[Fatback Band]], [[Jimmy Castor]] Bunch, [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[B.T. Express]], [[Shalamar]], One Way, [[Lakeside (band)|Lakeside]], [[Dazz Band]], [[The Gap Band]], [[Slave (band)|Slave]], [[Aurra]], [[Roger Troutman]] & [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], [[Con Funk Shun]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], [[Bar-Kays]], [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. \n\nFunk derivatives include [[avant-funk]], an [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] strain of funk; [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], a hybrid of electronic music and funk; [[funk metal]]; [[G-funk]], a mix of [[gangsta rap]] and [[psychedelic funk]]; [[Timba]], a form of funky Cuban dance music; and funk jam. It is also the main influence of Washington [[go-go]], a funk subgenre.

Strongly influenced by [[Hip-hop|American hip-hop]], the central theme addressed in the songs is [[conspicuous consumption]], and many ''funk ostentação'' artists sing about cars, motorcycles, drink, women, and ambitions to leave the [[favela]] and achieve life goals.\n\nWhile the dominant lyrical themes of the Rio de Janeiro scene at the time were [[criminality]] and lack of [[social justice]], the first ''funk ostentação'' song, \"Bonde da Juju\", recorded by MCs Backdi and Bio G3 in September 2008, established the new genre's opposing theme of [[ostentation]]. Several ''funk ostentação'' festivals were subsequently held in the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], and the movement began to grow. Its national debut came with the launch of the video for \"Megane\" by MC Boy do Charmes in mid-2011. As it became clear that ''funk ostentação'' would be best represented in audiovisual format, the cinematographer [[Kondzilla|KondZilla]] became the first to produce videos, which were received enthusiastically by fans. Of the ten most watched music videos in Brazil in both 2012 and 2013, three were ''funk ostentação''.\n\nIt was established as one of the most popular genres in Brazil with the death of Daniel Pellegrine also known as [[MC Daleste]], who was shot on stage in [[Campinas]] in July 2013.  He had been one of the principal proponents of the genre at the time of his death, and its extensive media coverage included widely televised tributes by other funk artists.\n\n''Funk ostentação'' became strongly associated with the emerging ''[[nova classe média]]'' (new middle class) in Brazil.",

Additionally, vocalists may be featured, being referred to as ''[[sindhen]]'' for females or ''[[gerong]]'' for males.\n\nAlthough the popularity of gamelan has declined slightly since the introduction of modern popular music to Indonesia, the art form is still widely respected, being commonly played in many traditional ceremonies. It may also be performed as entertainment for some modern events, such as official cultural, corporate, government or educational functions, both formal or informal. Gamelan is also, traditionally, arranged and performed to accompany religious [[ritual]]s, [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], [[dance]] theatre, [[Wayang wong|dance-drama]], traditional Indonesian [[theater]], [[Wayang|wayang puppets theatre]], [[singing]], [[concert]]s, [[festivals]], [[exhibitions]], and many more. Many consider gamelan to be an integral part of [[Indonesian culture]].\n\nIn 2014, Gamelan traditions were recognized as part of the [[National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia]] by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture]].\n\nOn 15 December 2021, Gamelan was inscribed onto the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]]. The nomination builds on the archaeological connection to the [[Borobudur]], and includes a focus on its role in fostering a sense of national identity and pride, in addition to wellbeing aspects such as mental health, the development of interpersonal skills and the connection between its cosmology and an ethics of mutual respect and care. The listing consists of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] gamelan (gamelan jawa) of [[Central Java]] and [[Special Region of Yogyakarta]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]] gamelan (gamelan bali) of [[Bali]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] gamelan (gamelan sunda) of [[West Java]], [[Madurese people|Madurese]] gamelan (gamelan madura) and [[Banyuwangi Regency|Banyuwangian]] Gamelan (gamelan banyuwangi) of [[East Java]], [[Gendang beleq]] of [[West Nusa Tenggara]], [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] gamelan (gamelan banjar) of [[South Kalimantan]], Gamelan peking of [[Lampung]], and [[Talempong]] of [[West Sumatra]] as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] from [[Indonesia]], and encouraged the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government to safeguard, transmit, promote, and develop the gamelan. Methods include the support of national, international and provincial festivals, the establishment of educational curricula including the Gamelan Goes to School program, an intention to increase the numbers of regional gamelan associations, and [[cultural diplomacy]] by sending gamelan specialists to global universities.{{fact|date=September 2024}}",

Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or [[police brutality]], and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias.

The style is characterized by basic [[chord (music)|chord]] structures played on electric guitars and other instruments, sometimes distorted through a [[distortion (music)|fuzzbox]], as well as often unsophisticated and occasionally aggressive lyrics and delivery. Its name derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family [[Garage (residential)|garage]], although many were professional.\n\nIn the US and Canada, [[surf rock]]—and later [[the Beatles]] and other [[beat music|beat]] groups of the [[British Invasion]]—motivated thousands of young people to form bands between 1963 and 1968.  Hundreds of grass-roots acts produced regional hits, some of which gained national popularity, usually played on [[AM radio]] stations.  With the advent of [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], numerous garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre's primitive stylistic framework. After 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music came to dominate the marketplace, garage rock records largely disappeared from national and regional charts, and the movement faded. Other countries in the 1960s experienced similar rock movements that have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock.\n\nDuring the 1960s, garage rock was not recognized as a distinct genre and had no specific name, but critical hindsight in the early 1970s—and especially the 1972 [[compilation album]] ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968|Nuggets]]''—did much to define and memorialize the style.  Between 1971 and 1973, certain American [[rock critic]]s began to retroactively identify the music as a genre and for several years used the term \"[[punk rock#Etymology|punk rock]]\" to describe it, making it the first form of music to bear the description, predating the more familiar use of the term appropriated by the later [[punk rock]] movement that its musical approach influenced.  The term \"garage rock\" gained favor amongst commentators and devotees during the 1980s.  The style has also been referred to as \"[[proto-punk]]\", or, in certain instances, \"frat rock\".\n\nIn the early to mid-1980s, several revival scenes emerged featuring acts that consciously attempted to replicate the look and sound of 1960s garage bands.  Later in the decade, a louder, more contemporary garage subgenre developed that combined garage rock with modern punk rock and other influences, sometimes using the [[garage punk (punk subgenre)|garage punk]] label originally and otherwise associated with 1960s garage bands.  In the 2000s, a wave of garage-influenced acts associated with the [[post-punk revival]] emerged, and some achieved commercial success.  Garage rock continues to appeal to musicians and audiences who prefer a \"back to basics\" or the \"[[Do it yourself|DIY (Do-It-Yourself)]]\" musical approach ethic.\n{{Toclimit|3}}",

It borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s [[glam rock]].\n\nEarly glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s, as visual elements taken from acts such as [[David Bowie]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], and [[New York Dolls]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[Punk rock#New York City|punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] movements taking place concurrently in New York City) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts such as [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles [[Sunset Strip]] music scene. Early glam metal bands include [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[Ratt]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Bon Jovi]], and [[Dokken]]. Glam metal achieved significant commercial success from approximately 1982 to 1991, bringing to prominence bands such as [[Poison (band)|Poison]], [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], and [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]. From a strictly visual perspective, glam metal is defined by flashy and tight-fitting clothing, makeup, and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional \"denim & leather\" aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by [[spandex]], [[lace]], and usually heavy use of bright colours.\n\nGlam metal suffered a decline in popularity in the early-mid 1990s, as the [[grunge]] and [[Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|alternative]] phenomena revolutionized hard rock, and fans' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a rejection of the glam metal visual style. During this period, many of the most successful acts of the genre's 1980s pinnacle suddenly found themselves facing disbandment as their audiences moved in another direction. Glam metal has experienced a resurgence since the late 1990s, with successful reunion tours of many popular acts from the genre's 1980s heyday, as well as the emergence of new, predominantly European bands, including [[The Darkness (band)|the Darkness]], [[Crashdïet]], [[Reckless Love]], and American bands [[Steel Panther]] and [[Black Veil Brides]].",

The flamboyant clothing and visual styles of performers were often [[camp (style)|camp]] or [[androgyny|androgynous]], and have been described as playing with other [[gender role]]s. '''Glitter rock''' was a more extreme version of glam rock.\n\nThe UK charts were inundated with glam rock acts from 1971 to 1975. The March 1971 appearance of [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] frontman [[Marc Bolan]] on the BBC's music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''—performing \"[[Hot Love (T.

Other British glam rock artists included [[David Bowie]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Slade]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Wizzard]] and [[Gary Glitter]]. Though not central to the genre, artists such as [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] also adopted glam styles. In the United States, the scene was much less prevalent, but US artists such as [[New York Dolls]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Suzi Quatro]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Jobriath]] achieved success in the UK and/or US. Glam rock declined after the mid-1970s, but influenced other musical genres including [[punk rock]], [[glam metal]], [[death rock]] and [[gothic rock]]. The [[New Romantic]] movement, which began as an underground fashion subculture movement in nightclubs in the late 1970s before becoming mainstream in the early 80s, was also inspired by the visuals of the glam rock era.",

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music vary according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music is characterized by dominant vocals and strong use of harmony with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century.\n\n[[Hymn]]s and sacred songs were often performed in a [[call-and-response]] fashion, heavily influenced by ancestral African music. Most of the churches relied on hand–clapping and foot–stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done ''[[a cappella]]''. The first published use of the term \"gospel song\" appeared in 1874.\n\nThe original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as [[George Frederick Root|George F. Root]], [[Philip Bliss]], [[Charles H. Gabriel]], [[William Howard Doane]], and [[Fanny Crosby]]. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following [[World War II]], gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate.\n\n[[Black Gospel music|Black]] and [[Southern gospel]] music are largely responsible for gospel's continued presence in [[contemporary Christian music]], with [[soul music]] by far the best–known [[popular music]] variant. The styles emerged from the [[African-American music]] and [[American folk music]] traditions and have evolved in various ways over the years, continuing to form the basis of [[Black church]] worship even today. It has also come to be used in churches of various other cultural traditions (especially within [[Pentecostalism]]), and by the gospel choir phenomenon spearheaded by [[Thomas A. Dorsey|Thomas Dorsey]], has become a form of musical devotion worldwide. Southern Afroamerican gospel groups used all–male, [[tenor]]–[[lead vocal|lead]]–[[baritone]]–[[bass (voice type)|bass]] quartets. [[Sensational Nightingales]], the Soul Stirrers, Swan Silvertones, and [[the Dixie Hummingbirds]] were famous gospel groups.

During the mid-1990s, [[Moonspell]], [[Theatres des Vampires]], [[Rotting Christ]] and [[Cradle of Filth]] brought the gothic approach to [[black metal]]. By the end of the decade, a [[symphonic metal]] variant of gothic metal had been developed by  [[Tristania (band)|Tristania]] and [[Within Temptation]]. [[Nightwish]] also integrated elements of gothic metal into their well-known mix of symphonic metal and [[power metal]].\n\nIn the 2000s, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where groups such as [[Entwine]], [[Charon (band)|Charon]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Lullacry]], [[the 69 Eyes]], and [[Poisonblack]] have released hit singles or chart-topping albums. In the US, however, only a few bands such as Type O Negative and [[Evanescence]] have found some degree of commercial success.",

The first post-punk bands which shifted toward dark music with gothic overtones include [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Joy Division]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], and [[the Cure]].\n\nThe genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk. Gothic rock stood out due to its darker sound, with the use of primarily minor or bass chords, reverb, dark arrangements, or dramatic and melancholic melodies, having inspirations in [[gothic literature]] allied with themes such as sadness, nihilism, dark romanticism, tragedy, melancholy and morbidity. These themes are often approached poetically. The sensibilities of the genre led the lyrics to represent the evil of the century and the romantic idealization of death and the supernatural imagination. Gothic rock then gave rise to a broader [[goth subculture]] that included clubs, [[Gothic fashion|fashion]] and publications in the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 21st century.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Grime''' is a genre of [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance music (EDM)]] that emerged in [[London]] in the early 2000s. It developed out of the earlier UK dance style [[UK garage]], and draws influences from [[Jungle music|jungle]], [[dancehall]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. The style is typified by rapid, syncopated [[breakbeat]]s, generally around 140 [[Tempo#Beats per minute|beats per minute]], and often features an aggressive or jagged electronic sound. [[Rapping|Emceeing]] is a significant element of the style, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.\n\nThe style initially spread among [[UK pirate radio|pirate radio]] stations and [[underground music|underground]] scenes before achieving some mainstream recognition in the UK during the mid-2000s through artists such as [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Kano (British musician)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], and [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]].  Grime's rise in the early 2000s benefited from a time before smartphones and social media dominated the music landscape, allowing the genre to develop at a slower, organic pace. Many of grime's foundational MCs, such as [[Ghetts]], Kano, and [[Skepta]], spent years refining their craft, with early career periods often lasting five to ten years. This period also produced significant archival material, from ''Run the Road'' compilations and ''Lord of the Mics'' DVDs to the ''RWD'' magazine, all of which captured grime's evolution at its peak. The genre’s emergence has often been compared to punk rock, a comparison solidified by tracks like [[Jammer (musician)|Jammer]]'s \"Dagenham Dave,\" a nod to The Stranglers' song of the same name.\n\nThe accessibility of music production technology, DIY media, and pirate radio stations contributed to grime’s grassroots nature. The genre was fueled by a \"create it if it doesn't exist\" mentality, similar to other independent music scenes. In its early days, grime was less a challenge to the music industry and more a direct parallel, with its own ecosystem of photographers, marketers, promoters, journalists, and label owners acting as both creators and gatekeepers. In the mid-2010s, grime began to receive popular attention in Canada. The genre has been described as the \"most significant musical development within the UK for decades.\"\n\nThough they are often compared, grime is generally considered distinct from hip hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.",

Grindcore is considered a more noise-filled style of hardcore punk while using hardcore's trademark characteristics such as heavily [[Guitar distortion|distorted]], [[Guitar tunings#Dropped tunings|down-tuned guitars]], grinding [[overdriven bass]], high-speed [[tempo]], [[blast beat]]s, and vocals which consist of [[Death growl|growls]], shouts and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups such as England's [[Napalm Death]] are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as [[Brutal Truth]] and [[Nasum]]. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and [[black humor]].\n\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\", which is far shorter than average for punk or metal; several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length. Napalm Death holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for shortest song ever recorded with the 1.316-second \"[[You Suffer]]\" (1987). Many bands, such as [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]], record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of [[Bar (music)|bars]] in length.\n\nA variety of subgenres and [[microgenre]]s have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore; including [[goregrind]], focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and [[pathology]]), and [[pornogrind]], fixated on [[pornographic]] lyrical themes. Another offshoot is cybergrind which incorporates [[electronic music]] elements such as [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore punk and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.",

Grunge fuses elements of [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The genre featured the [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] sound used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses [[electric guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[drums]], and vocals. Grunge also incorporates influences from [[indie rock]] bands such as [[Sonic Youth]]. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as [[social alienation]], [[doubt|self-doubt]], [[abuse]], [[neglect]], [[betrayal]], [[social isolation|social]] and [[emotional isolation|emotional]] isolation, [[addiction]], [[psychological trauma]], and a desire for [[Liberty|freedom]].\n\nThe early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label [[Sub Pop]] and the region's [[underground music]] scene, with local bands such as [[Green River (band)|Green River]], the [[Melvins]], and [[Mudhoney]] playing key roles in the genre's development. Sub Pop marketed the style shrewdly, encouraging media outlets to describe the Seattle sound as \"grunge\"; the style became known as a hybrid of [[punk (subculture)|punk]] and [[metal (music)|metal]]. By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals. \n\nGrunge broke through into the mainstream in the early-to-mid-1990s, led by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'' in 1991, and followed by other seminal crossover successes including [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', [[Soundgarden]]'s ''[[Badmotorfinger]]'', [[Alice in Chains]]' ''[[Dirt (Alice in Chains album)|Dirt]]'', and [[Stone Temple Pilots]]' ''[[Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)|Core]]''. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock, eventually making grunge the most popular form of [[rock music]].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the {{nowrap|mid-to-late 1990s}}, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]], labeled by ''Time'' as \"the [[John Lennon]] of the swinging Northwest\", struggled with an addiction to heroin before [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|his suicide]] in 1994. Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced [[modern rock]] music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into [[pop culture]] and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to [[Authenticity (philosophy)|be true to oneself]]. Grunge was also an influence on later genres such as [[post-grunge]].",

It reached the height of its popularity in the 1990s, especially in [[rural]] areas. Grupera music traces its roots to the [[rock group]]s of the 1960s, yet has evolved significantly over time. Typically performed by ensembles of four or more musicians, the genre prominently features [[electric guitar]]s, [[electronic keyboard]]s, and [[drum kit|drum]]s. The popularity of grupera music surged notably during the 1980s, propelling it into commercial viability and establishing its place within the [[Latin music]] landscape. Today, the genre is widely acknowledged and celebrated in prestigious Latin music awards ceremonies such as [[Lo Nuestro Awards]] and the [[Latin Grammy Awards]], reflecting its enduring influence and cultural significance across Latin America and beyond. Grupera music is a distinct Mexican musical genre that blends traditional [[ranchera]] melodies with influences from [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] and other regional styles like [[corrido]]s, [[cumbia]]s, [[Charanga-vallenata|charangas]], [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]], [[Bolero#Cuba|boleros]] and [[huapango]]s.\n\nSome of the most recognized groups and artists in the grupera genre include [[Los Bukis]], [[Los Temerarios]], [[Bronco (Mexican band)|Bronco]], [[Los Yonic's]], and [[Grupo Bryndis]]. Grupera music has enjoyed great popularity in Mexico and other parts of [[Latin America]], and continues to be an important part of Mexican musical culture.",

Moreover, the term is occasionally found in reference to the small, flat-bottomed tambourine (''tanbou d'bas'') played in [[Kwadril#Guadeloupe balakadri|kadri]] music, or even simply to drum (''tanbou'') in general.\n\nThe Gwo Ka musical practice emerged in the seventeenth century, during the transatlantic slave trade\n\n[[#Gwo_Ka:_the_rhythms|Seven simple drum patterns]] form the basis of gwo ka music, on which the drummers build rhythmic improvisations.  Different sizes of drums provide the foundation and its flourishes.  The largest, the [[Boula (music)|boula]], plays the central rhythm while the smaller ''maké'' (or markeur) embellishes upon it, inter-playing with dancers, audience, or singer.  Gwo ka singing is usually guttural, nasal, and rough, though it can also be bright and smooth, and is accompanied by uplifting and complex harmonies and melodies.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  There are also dances that tell folk stories that are accompanied by the gwo ka drums.\n\nIn modern, urban Guadeloupe, playing drums is not inextricably linked to dance anymore. But historically, the two practices were inseparable parts of the tradition of [[lewoz|léwôz]], events held fortnightly on Saturdays near the bigger plantations (payday), and each Saturday of the carnival season in areas of greater land parcelling. Gwoka music was–and still is–played throughout the year in various cultural manifestations such as ''léwòz'', ''kout’tanbou'', ''véyé'' and religious events, for example Advent's wake. \nToday, rural Guadeloupans still gather for léwôz experiences, but a modernized and popularized form of gwo ka exists independently, known as [[#Gwo_ka_moderne|gwo ka moderne]].",

It was at the time sometimes confused with [[Hard NRG|nu-NRG]], yet the styles were discernibly different.\n\n\"[[Don't You Want Me (Felix song)|Don't You Want Me]]\" by [[Felix (musician)|Felix]] is largely considered to be the track that launched the hardbag explosion. Produced by [[Rollo Armstrong]] of [[Faithless]], [[Red Jerry]] and [[Felix (musician)|Felix]], \"Don't You Want Me\" was released in 1992, scoring a Top 10 placing on the UK singles chart.\n\nThe popularity of the hardbag genre reached its zenith in 1995 with releases by [[Commander Tom]], [[Candy Girls]], Rollo & [[Sister Bliss]] and [[Mrs Wood]] all crossing over into the mainstream.  Indeed, the sound began to meld with [[mákina]], evident on tracks such as \"Forever Young\" by [[Interactive (Techno Band)|Interactive]] and \"Rainbow Islands\" by Seb.\n\nThe two most influential exponents of the sound were [[Netherlands|Dutch]] producer Patrick Prins (who, recording a variety of aliases, scored several large UK club and chart hits such as \"Bits & Pieces\" – Artemesia) and the late [[Tony De Vit]], whose hardbag composition \"Hooked\" is still considered one of the definitive examples of the genre.  Another great presence in the hardbag scene was [[Red Jerry]], former head of [[Hooj Choons]]. Other influential producers include [[Rollo Armstrong]] (later of the group [[Faithless (band)|Faithless]]) and [[Paul Masterson]], the latter of whom diversified hardbag remixes to incorporate [[hi-NRG]] elements.\n\nBy early 1997 the Hardbag craze had died down, since then Hardbag created an influence on  [[UK hard house]] and [[electro house]]. Labels such as Tripoli Trax expounded this sound via releases such as \"Bells Of Revolution\" by Lemon 8 and \"Raise Your Hands\" by Knuckleheadz.\n\nSeveral hardbag producers went on to become big names within the trance scene in the late 1990s. These included [[Matt Darey]] (as Bi-Boy Action Squad, Orgasmatron and Space Baby), [[Sister Bliss]] (as a solo artist and co-producer with [[Rollo Armstrong|Rollo]] and [[Jon of the Pleased Wimmin]]), and [[John Graham (producer)|John Graham]] whose Quivver alias had a hardbag hit with \"Saxy Lady\" (1994).",

It was also inspired by [[Washington, D.C., hardcore#History|Washington, D.C.]], and [[Punk rock#New York City|New York]] punk rock and early [[proto-punk]]. Hardcore punk generally eschews [[commercialism]], the established [[music industry]] and \"anything similar to the characteristics of [[Rock music|mainstream rock]]\" and often addresses social and political topics with \"confrontational, politically charged lyrics\".\n\nHardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|Washington, D.C.]], [[Boston hardcore|Boston]], and [[New York hardcore|New York]], as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom.

Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the [[independent record label]]s in the 1980s and with the [[Do it yourself|DIY ethics]] in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including [[grunge]] and [[thrash metal]].\n\nAlthough the music genre started in English-speaking Western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in [[Italian hardcore|Italy]], [[Japanese hardcore|Japan]] and [[Punk in Brazil|Brazil]].",

Hardstyle mixes influences from [[techno]], [[new beat]] and [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]].\n\nEarly hardstyle was typically written at 140 [[Tempo|BPM]] (''beats per minute''); however, modern hardstyle is faster, produced around 150 BPM. It consisted of overdriven and hard-sounding kick drums, often accompanied by an offbeat bass, known as a \"reverse bass\". As the genre grew, the production techniques and songwriting changed to be suited to a more commercial audience. Modern hardstyle can be recognized by its use of synthesizer melodies and distorted sounds, coupled with hardstyle's signature combination of [[percussion]] and [[bass (sound)|bass]]. The genre is particularly known for its [[harmony|harmonic]] use of kickdrums. Due to the sustained nature of a hardstyle kick, producers are able to play basslines by using only the kick itself, which becomes a distinct bass tone through a series of [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and layering (among other methods). This technique is known as \"pitching\" a kick.\n\nThe genre gained commercial acceptance in the 2010s, with hardstyle artists performing on the biggest stages in [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] worldwide.\n\nHardstyle influenced other styles of electronic dance music such as [[big room house]], which began sharing similarities with hardstyle like structures, rhythms, and later, pitching kicks became popular in big room too. Hardstyle also played a large influence in [[frenchcore]] and [[happy hardcore]] music, which both became popular in the late 2010s with the hardstyle audience after producers started applying hardstyle production techniques and melodic styles to the genres.",

With roots in [[blues rock]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[acid rock]], heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by [[distortion (music)|distorted]] guitars, extended [[guitar solo]]s, emphatic [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[loudness]].\n\nIn 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers – British bands [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]] – were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and [[shock rock]] of [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]; the blues-rooted rock of [[Aerosmith]]; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of [[Van Halen]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence, while [[Motörhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]\" or \"[[headbanging|headbangers]]\". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and [[machismo]], an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became popular with groups such as [[Bon Jovi]], [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Meanwhile, however, [[Underground music|underground scenes]] produced an array of more aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], while other [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] became – and remain – [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include [[groove metal]] and [[nu metal]], the latter of which often incorporates elements of [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].",

It uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional African music, but is typically played with Western instruments. Highlife is characterized by [[jazz]]y [[Horn section|horns]] and [[guitar]]s which lead the band and its use of the two-finger plucking [[Guitar picking|guitar style]] that is typical of African music. Recently it has acquired an uptempo, synth-driven sound.\n\nHighlife gained popularity and the genre spread throughout West African regions. Pioneers like [[Rex Lawson|Cardinal Rex Lawson]], [[E. T. Mensah|E.T. Mensah]], [[Victor Uwaifo]], all perfected this sound by infusing traditional Africa drums and western \"Native Blues\". After the Second World War, its popularity came within the [[Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]], as they got influenced to form [[Igbo highlife]] which became their country's most popular music genre in the 1960s.\n\nHighlife has remained a part of popular music for Ghanaians and [[Ghanaian diaspora|their diaspora]] globally through its integration with religious institutions and the positive effect it had on immigrating Ghanaians leaving their homeland.",

The style is characterized by its synthesis of a wide range of musical techniques. Hip-hop includes [[rapping]] often enough that the terms can be used synonymously. However, \"hip-hop\" more properly denotes an entire [[hip-hop culture|subculture]]. Other key markers of the genre are the [[disc jockey]], [[turntablism]], [[scratching]], [[beatboxing]], and [[hip hop production|instrumental tracks]]. Cultural interchange has always been central to the hip-hop genre. It simultaneously borrows from its social environment while commenting on it.\n\nThe hip-hop genre and culture emerged from [[block parties]] in ethnic minority neighborhoods of New York City, particularly [[The Bronx|Bronx]]. DJs began expanding the instrumental [[Break (music)|breaks]] of popular records when they noticed how excited it would make the crowds. The extended instrumental breaks provided a platform for [[Breakdancing|break dancers]] and rappers. These breakbeats enabled the subsequent evolution of the hip-hop style. Many of the records used were [[disco]] due to its popularity at the time.\n\nThis disco-inflected music is known as [[old-school hip-hop]]. The genre became more stylistically diverse in the 1980s as [[electro music]] started to inform [[new-school hip-hop]]. The transition between the mid-1980s and 1990s became known as hip-hop's [[Golden age hip-hop|Golden age]] as the genre started to earn wide critical acclaim and generate massive sales.\n\nThe popularity of hip-hop music expanded throughout the late 1990s and into the 21st century, where it became a worldwide phenomenon. Most countries have local variations on the style. By 2017, hip-hop had become the bestselling genre of popular music.",

In 1994, he signed with [[Valentim de Carvalho]], a Portuguese division of [[EMI Records]], with whom he recorded two albums: ''Pé Na Tchôn, Karapinha Na Céu'' (1995) and ''Kanimabo'' (1997). Intelligent and charismatic, the general public and media liked General D., even though his lyrics were often very [[anti-establishment]].\n\nCalifornian hip hop artist and poet [[Ithaka (artist)|Ithaka]] (also known as: Ithaka Darin Pappas) is often included in the hip hop tuga community because he lived and recorded in Lisbon during 1992-1998 and was among the first wave of artists working with hip hop in Portugal. There he completed his first two (of eight) albums; ''[[Flowers and the Color of Paint]]'' (1995) and ''[[Stellafly]]'' (1997). His 1995 song \"Escape from the City of Angels\" (featuring Lisbon's [[Marta Dias]]) was included in the soundtrack of [[Antoine Fuqua]]'s U.S. feature film directorial debut ''[[The Replacement Killers]]'' ([[Columbia Pictures]]) starring [[Chow Yun Fat]], [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] and [[Michael Rooker]].\nThe song also appeared on the show ''[[Good Girls Don't (TV series)|Good Girl's Don't]]'' on [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s [[Oxygen Channel]].\n\nIn a 2017 article in ''Rimas e Batidas'' titled \"Os Álbuns Mais caros Do Hip Hop Português\" (\"''The Most Expensive Portuguese Hip Hop Albums''\"), the journalist Hugo Jorge explains that the most sought after and used hip hop tuga records were made by Da Weasel, Fuse, [[Orelha Negra]], Mind Da Gap, Micro, XEG, Mundo Segundo, Dealema and DJ Bomberjack.\n\nThe new school rapper [[Piruka]] has the most watched hip hop tuga song on [[YouTube]], which is \"Se Eu Não Acordar Amanhã\".",

While exaggerated violence and the supernatural are common in horrorcore, the genre also frequently presents more realistic yet still disturbing portrayals of [[mental illness]] and [[drug abuse]]. Some horrorcore artists eschew supernatural themes or exaggerated violence in favor of more subtle and dark psychological horror imagery and lyrics.\n\nHorrorcore has incited controversy, with some members of the law enforcement community asserting that the genre incites crime.

The music has been variously described as a 21st-century update of [[psychedelia]], a reappropriation of media-saturated [[capitalist]] culture, and an \"American cousin\" to British [[hauntology (music)|hauntology]].\n\nIn response to Keenan's article, ''The Wire'' received a slew of [[hate mail]] that derided hypnagogic pop as the \"worst genre created by a journalist\". Some of the tagged artists rejected the label or denied that such a unified style exists. During the 2010s, critical attention for the genre waned, although the style's \"revisionist nostalgia\" sublimated into various youth-oriented cultural [[zeitgeist]]s. Hypnagogic pop evolved into [[vaporwave]], with which it is sometimes conflated.",

Although the term was originally used to describe rock music released through [[independent record labels]], by the 1990s it became more widely associated with the music such bands produced.\n\nThe sound of indie rock has its origins in the New Zealand [[Dunedin sound]] of [[the Chills]], [[Tall Dwarfs]], [[the Clean]] and [[the Verlaines]], and early 1980s [[college rock]] radio stations who would frequently play [[jangle pop]] bands like [[the Smiths]] and [[R.E.M.]] The genre solidified itself during the mid–1980s with ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''[[C86]]'' cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of [[Sonic Youth]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]] and [[Unrest (band)|Unrest]] in the United States. During the 1990s, indie rock bands like Sonic Youth, [[the Pixies]] and [[Radiohead]] all released albums on major labels and subgenres like [[slowcore]], [[Midwest emo]], [[slacker rock]] and [[space rock]] began. By this time, \"indie\" had evolved to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes on the genre: [[baggy]] in [[Manchester]]; [[Grebo (music)|grebo]] in [[Stourbridge]] and [[Leicester]]; and [[shoegaze]] in London and the [[Thames Valley]].\n\nDuring the 1990s, the mainstream success of [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]], two movements influenced by indie rock, brought increased attention to the genre and saw record labels use their independent status as a marketing tactic. This led to a split within indie rock: one side conforming to mainstream radio; the other becoming increasingly experimental. By this point, \"indie rock\" referred to the musical style rather than ties to the independent music scene. In the 2000s, indie rock reentered the mainstream through the [[garage rock revival|garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival]] and the influence of [[the Strokes]] and [[the Libertines]]. This success was exacerbated in the middle of the decade by [[Bloc Party]], [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[the Killers]] and indie rock proliferated into the landfill indie movement.",

Its structure and patterns are based on Indian music with typical jazz improvisation overlaid. While the term itself may be comparatively recent, the concept dates at least to the mid-1950s. Musicians including [[John Coltrane]], [[Yusef Lateef]] and others reflect Indian influences.\n\n[[The Mahavishnu Orchestra]] might be an early example of a jazz group with Indian influences as [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] at that time was a devotee of [[Sri Chinmoy]]. Others found the improvisational elements already in some [[Music of India|Indian music]] to fit well with jazz. Although [[John Mayer (composer)|John Mayer]] and [[Joe Harriott]] are perhaps the most important influences in the movement. In addition [[Alice Coltrane]] is also known for relational work.\n\nIn the early 1970s, [[L.&nbsp;Subramaniam]] pioneered a new movement of Indo-jazz fusion, which he called \"neo-fusion\". It became very popular especially after the release of his albums such as ''Fantasy Without Limits'' (1979), ''Blossom'' (1981), ''Spanish Wave'' (1983), ''Conversations'' (1984), ''Indian Express'' (1985), and ''Mani and Co.'' (1986), in which he collaborated with musicians including [[Stephane Grappelli]], [[George Duke]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[Emil Richards]] among others.\n\nIn America, Broto Roy, [[tabla]] percussionist, began composing and recording his brand of \"Raga-Jazz\" with his debut CD ''American Raga'' (1998), which was taken aboard and played on the [[International Space Station]] when [[Dennis Tito]] (America's first space tourist) blasted off into space. [[List of EMI labels#EMI India|EMI&nbsp;India]] released it in India. His second CD, ''Total Immersion{{snd}} Live at the Kennedy Center'', is only the second CD authorized for public release by the [[Kennedy Center]] (the first was by [[Pavarotti]]). His Quartet has released two CDs: ''Ancient Algorithms'' (2015) and ''All Barriers Fall'' (May 15, 2018).",

Many artists within the genre moved on to different styles that included Hard rock, heavy metal, nu metal, cyber metal, synth-metal, synth-rock, and synth-pop among other genres.\n\nColdwave today is a small, niche scene within industrial music.

[[AllMusic]] defines industrial music as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of [[rock music|rock]] and [[electronic music]]\" that was \"initially a blend of [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]] electronics experiments ([[tape music]], [[musique concrète]], [[white noise]], [[synthesizer]]s, [[music sequencer|sequencer]]s, etc.) and [[punk rock|punk]] provocation.\" The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of [[Industrial Records]] by members of [[Throbbing Gristle]] and [[Monte Cazazza]]. While the genre name originated with Throbbing Gristle's emergence in the United Kingdom, artists and labels vital to the genre also emerged in the United States and other countries.\n\nThe first industrial artists experimented with [[noise music|noise]] and aesthetically controversial topics, both musically and visually, such as [[fascism]], [[sexual perversion]], and the [[occult]]. Prominent industrial musicians include Throbbing Gristle, [[Monte Cazazza]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Boyd Rice]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Z'EV]]. On Throbbing Gristle's 1977 debut album, ''[[The Second Annual Report]]'', they coined the slogan \"industrial music for industrial people.\" The industrial music scene also developed strongly in [[Chicago]], with the city's [[Wax Trax! Records]] at one point leading the industrial music scene. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included 1940s musique concrète and varied [[world music]] sources in addition to rock-era acts such as [[Faust (band)|Faust]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[the Velvet Underground]], and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' (1975). Musicians also cite writers such as [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[J. G. Ballard]] and artists such as [[Brion Gysin]] as influences.\n\nWhile the term was self-applied by a small coterie of groups and individuals associated with Industrial Records in the late 1970s, it was broadened to include artists influenced by the original movement or using an \"industrial\" aesthetic. Over time, the genre's influence spread into and blended with styles including [[ambient music|ambient]], synth music and rock such as [[Front 242]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[KMFDM]], and [[Sister Machine Gun]], acts associated with the [[Chicago]]-based [[Wax Trax! Records]] imprint. [[Electro-industrial]] music is a primary subgenre that developed in the 1980s, with the most notable bands in the genre being [[Front Line Assembly]] and [[Skinny Puppy]]. The two other most notable hybrid genres are [[industrial rock]] and [[industrial metal]], which include bands such as [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Rammstein]], and [[Fear Factory]], the first three of which released a platinum-selling album each in the [[1990s in music|1990s]].",

The music often described with the term originally emerged in the early 1990s from the culture and sound palette of styles of [[electronic dance music]] such as [[acid house]], [[ambient techno]], [[Detroit techno]] and [[breakbeat]]; it has been regarded as better suited to home listening than dancing.  Prominent artists in the style include [[Aphex Twin]], [[Autechre]], [[Squarepusher]], [[μ-Ziq]], [[The Black Dog (band)|the Black Dog]], [[the Future Sound of London]], and [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]].\n\nThe use of the term \"intelligent dance music\" was likely inspired by the 1992 [[Warp (record label)|Warp]] compilation ''[[Artificial Intelligence (compilation album)|Artificial Intelligence]]'' in 1993 with the formation of the \"IDM list\", an [[electronic mailing list]] which was chartered for the discussion of English artists appearing on the compilation. The term has been widely criticised and dismissed by artists associated with it. [[Rephlex Records]], a label co-created by Aphex Twin, coined the term '''braindance''' as an alternative. In 2014, music critic [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] observed that the term IDM \"is widely reviled but still commonly used\".",

In European understanding, [[a cappella]] is also used to describe this form of singing.\n\nThe word itself does not have a literal translation; it is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] verb {{lang|zu|-cathama}}, which means 'walking softly', or 'tread carefully'. Isicathamiya contrasts with an earlier name for Zulu a cappella singing, [[Mbube (genre)|mbube]], meaning 'lion'. The change in name marks a transition in the style of the music: traditionally, music described as mbube is sung loudly and powerfully, while isicathamiya focuses more on achieving a harmonious blend between the voices. The name also refers to the style's tightly choreographed dance moves that keep the singers on their toes.\n\nSouth African singing groups such as [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] demonstrate this style. Isicathamiya choirs are traditionally all male. Its roots reach back before the turn of the 20th century, when numerous men left the homelands to search for work in the cities. As many of the tribesmen became urbanized, the style was forgotten through much of the 20th century.\n\nToday, isicathamiya competitions in [[Johannesburg]] and [[Durban]] take place on Saturday nights, with up to 30 choirs performing from 8 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock the following morning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}}",

Israeli hip hop artists enjoy wide popularity in Israel and have succeeded in appealing to international markets particularly the United States.\n\nThe genre began gaining popularity in Israel during the 1990s, influenced by global hip hop trends. However, traces of native Hebrew hip hop can be found as early as the mid-1980s. [[Yair Nitzani]], then a member of the Israeli rock group [[Tislam]], released an old-school hip hop parody album under the name \"Hashem Tamid\". This early work was influenced by New York's hip hop scene. In 1993, Nigel Haadmor and [[Yossi Fine]] produced the album \"Humus Metamtem\", further establishing the genre in Israel. Haadmor, born Yehoshua Sofer, brought a unique sound influenced by his Caribbean roots and Jewish heritage.\n\nA significant milestone in Israeli hip hop was the establishment of the radio show \"Esek Shachor\" (Black Business) in 1995 by [[Quami De La Fox]] (Eyal Freedman) and DJ Liron Teeni on [[Galgalatz]], the Israeli Army's radio station. This show played a mix of Hebrew, Arabic, and English hip hop and became highly popular, significantly influencing the Israeli hip hop scene. Teeni is credited with encouraging artists to rap in Hebrew, thus making the genre more authentic to Israeli culture and accessible to the local audience.\n\nThe first notable Israeli hip hop group, [[Shabak Samech]], began rapping in Hebrew in 1995, inspired by the [[Beastie Boys]]. Initially, their music was met with resistance, but they persevered and eventually found success. Israeli hip hop often addresses themes unique to the country's social and political landscape, including the struggles of growing up in Israel, spirituality, and politics.",

Typically, jam bands will play variations of pre-existing songs, extending them to [[musical improvisation|improvise]] over  [[vamp (music)|chord patterns]] or rhythmic [[groove (music)|groove]]s. Jam bands are known for having a very fluid structure, playing long sets of music which often cross genre boundaries, varying their nightly setlists, and [[Segue (music)|segueing]] from one song into another without a break.\n\nThe jam-band musical style, spawned from the [[psychedelic rock]] movement of the 1960s, was a feature of nationally famed groups such as the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[The Allman Brothers Band]], whose regular touring schedules continued into the 1990s. The style influenced a new wave of jam bands who toured the United States with jam band-style concerts in the late 1980s and early '90s, such as [[Phish]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[moe.]], and [[Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit]]. The jam-band movement gained mainstream exposure in the US in the early 1990s with the rise of Phish and the Dave Matthews Band as major touring acts and the dissolution of the Grateful Dead following [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death in 1995.\n\nJam-band artists often perform a wide variety of genres. While the Grateful Dead is categorized as psychedelic rock, by the 1990s the term \"jam band\" was applied to acts that incorporated genres such as [[blues]], [[country music]], [[contemporary folk music]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]], [[world music]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Southern rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[acid jazz]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk rock]] and [[electronic music]] into their sound. Although the term has been used to describe cross-genre and improvisational artists, it retains an affinity to the fan cultures of the Grateful Dead or Phish.\n\nA feature of the jam-band scene is fan recording of live concerts. While the mainstream music industry often views fan taping as \"illegal [[bootleg recording|bootlegging]]\", jam bands often allow their fans to make tapes or recordings of their live shows. Fans trade recordings and collect recordings of different live shows, because improvisational jam bands play their songs differently at each performance.",

Marley wanted to attend a concert by the [[Flower Travellin Band]] and when looking for information, he met famed Japanese [[percussionist]] \"Pecker\" who informed him that the group had already disbanded. The two became good friends, and Pecker suggested to Marley a collaboration between acclaimed Japanese and Jamaican artists.

The albums featured Japanese artists {{nihongo|[[Minako Yoshida]]|吉田美奈子}}, {{nihongo|[[Ryuuichi Sakamoto]]|坂本龍一}}, {{nihongo|[[Naoya Matsuoka]]|松岡直也}}, {{nihongo|[[Shigeharu Mukai]]|向井滋春}}, and {{nihongo|[[Akira Sakata]]|坂田明}}, alongside Jamaican artists [[Augustus Pablo]], [[Sly & Robbie]], [[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], [[Rico Rodriguez (musician)|Rico Rodriguez]], [[Carlton Barrett]] and [[Marcia Griffiths]].

Another pioneering artist was Nahki. He was scouted by [[Sugar Minott]] and began performing in Jamaica, and later formed Japan's first reggae festival \"Japansplash\" in 1985. The esteemed band {{nihongo|[[Jagatara]]|じゃがたら}} combined [[punk rock]], [[jazz]], and [[funk]] with reggae and influenced hybrid artists such as [[Ego-Wrappin']]. The [[dancehall]] style was brought to Japan by [[Rankin' Taxi]] in the mid 1980s, and rock group [[The Roosters]] incorporated [[ska]] into some of their songs which influenced artists such as the [[Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra]], and [[Kemuri]].\n\nMusical relations between Jamaican and Japanese artists remains strong, often with collaborations between artists.\n\nThe most important reggae festival is the Yokohama reggae festival or Yokohama Reggae Sai, which is usually in July to September, and has been moved to nearby Kawasaki.",

Its roots are in [[blues]], [[ragtime]], European [[harmony]], African rhythmic rituals, [[spirituals]], [[hymns]], [[march (music)|marches]], [[vaudeville]] song, and [[dance music]]. Since the 1920s [[Jazz Age]], it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[popular music]]. Jazz is characterized by [[swung note|swing]] and [[blue note]]s, complex [[Chord (music)|chords]], [[Call and response (music)|call and response vocals]], [[polyrhythm]]s and [[Jazz improvisation|improvisation]].\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] began in the early 1910s, combining earlier [[brass band]] marches, French [[quadrille]]s, [[biguine]], ragtime and blues with collective [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]]. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented [[Swing (music)|swing]] [[big band]]s, [[Kansas City jazz]] (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and [[gypsy jazz]] (a style that emphasized [[Bal-musette|musette]] waltzes) were the prominent styles. [[Bebop]] emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. [[Cool jazz]] developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of [[hard bop]], which introduced influences from [[rhythm and blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. [[Modal jazz]] developed in the late 1950s, using the [[musical mode|mode]], or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did [[free jazz]], which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. [[Jazz fusion|Jazz fusion]] appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with [[rock music]]'s rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called [[smooth jazz]] became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as [[Latin jazz|Latin]] and [[Afro-Cuban jazz]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",

Electric guitars, amplifiers, and keyboards that were popular in rock began to be used by jazz musicians, particularly those who had grown up listening to rock and roll.\n\nJazz fusion [[arrangements]] vary in complexity. Some employ groove-based vamps fixed to a single key or a single chord with a simple, repeated melody. Others use elaborate [[chord progression]]s, unconventional time signatures, or melodies with [[Hauptstimme|counter-melodies]]. These arrangements, whether simple or complex, typically include improvised sections that can vary in length, much like in other forms of jazz.\n\nAs with jazz, jazz fusion can employ brass and woodwind instruments such as trumpet and saxophone, but other instruments often substitute for these. A jazz fusion band is less likely to use [[piano]] and [[double bass]], and more likely to use [[electric guitar]], [[electric piano]], [[synthesizer]]s, and [[bass guitar]].\n\nThe term \"jazz rock\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"jazz fusion\" and for music performed by late 1960s- and 1970s-era rock bands that added jazz elements to their music. After a decade of popularity during the 1970s, fusion expanded its improvisatory and experimental approaches through the 1980s in parallel with the development of a radio-friendly style called [[smooth jazz]]. Experimentation continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Fusion albums, even those that are made by the same group or artist, may include a variety of musical styles. Rather than being a codified musical style, fusion can be viewed as a musical tradition or approach.",

      "wikitext_description": "The term \"'''jazz rock'''\" (or \"jazz/rock\") is sometimes used as a synonym for \"jazz fusion\". [[The Free Spirits]] have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz rock band.\n\nRock bands such as [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[The Ides of March (band)|The Ides of March]], [[Blood Sweat & Tears|Blood, Sweat & Tears]], [[Chase (band)|Chase]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]], [[Brand X]], [[the Mothers of Invention]] and [[If (band)|IF]] blended jazz and rock with electric instruments.  Miles Davis' fusion jazz was \"pure melody and tonal color\", while Frank Zappa's music was more \"complex\" and \"unpredictable\". Zappa released the solo album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' in 1969. The album contained long instrumental pieces with a jazz influence. Zappa released two albums, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', in 1972, which were influenced by jazz. [[George Duke]] and [[Aynsley Dunbar]] played on both. 1970s band [[Steely Dan]] has been lauded by music critic [[Neil McCormick]] for their \"smooth, smart jazz-rock fusion\".\n\nThe jazz artists of the 1960s and 1970s had a large impact on many rock groups of that era such as [[Santana (band)|Santana]] and Frank Zappa. They took jazz phrasing and harmony and incorporated it into modern rock music, significantly changing music history and paving the way for artists that would follow in their footsteps. Carlos Santana in particular has given much credit to Miles Davis and the influence he had on his music. While Miles Davis combined jazz with modal and rock influences, [[Carlos Santana]] combined these along with Latin rhythms and feel, shaping a whole new genre, [[Latin rock]]. Other rock artists such as [[Gary Moore]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[The Doors]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[John Scofield]], and [[The Allman Brothers Band]] have taken influences from blues, jazz, [[blues rock]], jazz rock and incorporated it into their own music.\n\nAccording to AllMusic, the term jazz rock \"may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation...jazz rock first emerged during the late '60s as an attempt to fuse the visceral power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational fireworks of jazz. Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late '60s and early '70s: [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[progressive rock]], and the singer-songwriter movement.\"\n\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, jazz rock paralleled [[free jazz]] by being \"on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s\". He said the albums ''[[Emergency! (album)|Emergency!]]'' (1969) by the [[Tony Williams Lifetime]] and ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975) by Miles Davis \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before\". This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s, American fusion was being combined in the U.K. with progressive rock and psychedelic music. Bands who were part of this movement included Brand X (with [[Phil Collins]] of Genesis), Bruford ([[Bill Bruford]] of Yes), Nucleus (led by [[Ian Carr]]), and Soft Machine. Throughout Europe and the world this movement grew due to bands like [[Magma (band)|Magma]] in France, [[Passport (band)|Passport]] in Germany, [[Time (Yugoslav band)|Time]], [[Leb i Sol]] and [[September (band)|September]] in Yugoslavia, and guitarists [[Jan Akkerman]] (The Netherlands), [[Volker Kriegel]] (Germany), [[Terje Rypdal]] (Norway), [[Jukka Tolonen]] (Finland), [[Ryo Kawasaki]] (Japan), and [[Kazumi Watanabe]] (Japan).",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Jersey club rap''' is a fusion genre of [[hip-hop]] and [[Jersey club music]].\n\nThe years between 2018 and 2020 were pivotal to the resurgence in popularity of Jersey club music as, for the first time ever, Jersey artists (rappers and singers) began making original rap songs using Jersey club beats. [[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]] rapper Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain, [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]] singer [[Cookiee Kawaii]], and Newark producer/DJ/artist Uniiqu3 began to format Jersey club beats into song format using their own vocals and lyrics for verses, hooks, and bridges. Morphing Jersey Club into this sample-free, lyric infused song format now allowed radio stations like [[WQHT|Hot 97]], [[WHTZ|Z100]], [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]], and [[Sirius XM]] to play these records in regular rotation with Hip-Hop, R&B, [[Top 40]], etc. This allowed Jersey Club music to gain a much wider audience. Where Jersey Club music was originally pioneered, produced, and created by the producers and the DJ's, the years 2018 - 2020 saw the emergence of the first ever Jersey Club \"Artists\". Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain, Cookiee Kawaii, Uniiqu3, Chad B and DJ Jay Hood fall into this new category of Jersey Club Artists.\n\nUnicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain alongside producers Ace Mula and DJ Fade began experimenting with a new sound for Jersey Club music in 2018. While much of the Jersey Club music being created catered to dancers and children, Unicorn151, Ace Mula, and DJ Fade began producing songs that catered to their gangsta rap fans. Simultaneously in neighboring [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], the [[Brooklyn drill]] sound of [[Pop Smoke]], [[Fivio Foreign]], and [[22Gz]] was also becoming a worldwide phenomena, which naturally trickled its influence and sound to the neighboring boroughs of NYC and nearby New Jersey. DJ Fade and Unicorn, through mutual friends at the radio stations, were able to collaborate with these Brooklyn drill rappers to produce Jersey Club remixes for many popular Brooklyn drill artists. While the DJ Fade and Unicorn duo, known as Jersey Gods, were the first to fuse both sounds, these songs were not yet considered Jersey Drill, but rather Jersey Club mixes of [[Brooklyn drill]] and [[UK drill]].\n\nIn 2019 Ace Mula was commissioned to produce Jersey Club beats for Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain to rap over. Ace Mula's beats were specifically tailored for [[Trap music|trap]], [[Drill music|drill]], and [[Gangsta rap]], which allowed Unicorn151 to maintain his natural rap cadence, while the beats switched between trap, drill, and Jersey club beats throughout the songs. This specific usage of Brooklyn drill inspired production on top of Jersey club beat patterns gave each record a distinct sound that could easily be identified as having origins in New Jersey. These newfound Jersey club rap records inspired many rappers in Newark and the surrounding areas to embrace their homegrown sound and begin rapping on beats infused with Unicorn151 and Ace Mula's signature Jersey club sound.\n\nIn 2020, [[PBS|PBS Soundfield]] visited Newark for a documentary to interview Uniiqu3, Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain, DJ Fade, and DJ Tameil for an in-depth segment detailing the newest evolutions of Jersey Club music and this new generation of Jersey Club Artists.\n\nIn 2021, Newark-based Jersey club rapper [[Bandmanrill]] released a [[Instagram|reel]] via [[Instagram]] and [[TikTok]] where he joked about rapping [[Drill music|drill]] lyrics over a Jersey club beat. The skit went viral as fans took an immediate liking to Bandmanrill's drill-like flow, cadence, and lyrics over the Jersey Club beat. Bandmanrill went on to turn his skit into the full length single and video titled \"HeartBroken\" produced by Newark producer [[MCVertt|McVertt]]. This sparked a widespread social media debate on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook as to what this new sound should be called or titled. Jersey Drill or Jersey Club Drill?\n\nIn 2021, Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain, Bandmanrill, and Ace Mula released the first official Jersey Drill song and music video titled \"Jack N Drill\". Together they solidified and jump-started the Jersey Drill movement by collaborating on the \"Jack N Drill\" single, which was followed by a [[Drill music|drill-style]] music video signifying that this sound is officially the \"Jersey Drill\" sound. The title \"Jack N Drill\" is a triple-entendre play on words. \"Jackin{{' \"}} is street slang for stealing or robbing. Newark, New Jersey, is historically notorious for \"[[Carjacking|carjackin']]{{-\"}}, so it can humorously be said that New Jersey is \"jackin{{' \"}}, or forcefully taking, the drill sound from the UK and Brooklyn. \"Jackin{{' \"}} is also street slang in NYC for \"claiming something with pride\". Many NYC drill artists tout that they are \"jackin{{' \"}} a certain gang affiliation. Thus, \"Jack N Drill\" can also be interpreted that New Jersey is pridefully claiming the drill sound as their own sub-genre. \"Jack N Drill\" also plays off of the story \"[[Jack and Jill]]\", which can be interpreted that New Jersey and Brooklyn Drill see themselves as partners overcoming the same obstacles and working towards the same goal.\n\nPopular New Jersey [[Drill music|drill]] artists include Unicorn151 aka Killa Kherk Cobain, MBM Franko, Bandmanrill, Ib Mattic, Daidough, and Baby ATM.",

It features a swift rhythm played on [[drum]]s and accompanied by a [[guitar]]. Jit evolved out many diverse influences, including domestic [[chimurenga music|chimurenga]], Congolese [[African Rumba|rumba]] and Tanzanian guitar styles.{{cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nThe genre was popularized in the 1980s by bands like [[Chazezesa Challengers]], [[Four Brothers (band)|The Four Brothers]], and [[Bhundu Boys]]. Jit is one of Zimbabwean fast beat, but there is a confusion between the more popular \"sungura\" which is said to be Jit which was popularised by Chazezesa Challengers and many others including Alick Macheso and Orchestra Mberikwazvo.{{cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nGibbs calls his type of Jit \"Urban Jit\" due to its mellowness and soft tempo which comprises fused elements of calypso, country, and any other genre depending on the composition as a way to improve its appeal to the new generation as culture is always evolving.{{cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nJit music is originally played by people singing in a circle and playing to or singing with one or two drums called \"Mutumba\" and these drums are played in rhythm with each other and in sync with the song\" vocals\". One will be leading with the vocals and the rest will answer to the call and sometimes sing altogether in harmony, the lead vocalist may chant and the people answering will give the vocalist room to do all the adlibing before they answer.{{cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nIn the early 1970s there was a very popular group called \"Dzumbunu Choir\". This group used to play raw Jit with the basic instruments of drum or drums and \"hosho\" jingles. Dzumbunu Choir was resident at Goromonzi or Arcturus area about sixty kilometres out of Harare on the North eastern side. As people sing they may use jingles or \"hosho\" shakers as African music is generally percussive. Jit is in nowadays mostly used in its raw content by political parties as a campaign vehicle due to its flexibility in accommodating chants, singing, expressiveness and infectious tunes that are so catchy and easy to learn if a new song is introduced.{{cn|date=August 2023}}\n\nJit is a highly danceable beat that commands the listener to dance and there are so many types of dances associated with it such as hwishu, tuwisti, kongonya, borodhero, honda, chipisi and many others. Bhorodhero is the most popular one due to it being popularised by Alick Macheso and System Tazvida's Chazezesa Challengers in their repertoires. The name bhorodhero is a derivative from a race course's name in Harare called Borrowdale Race Course as the dance resembles a galloping horse.{{cn|date=August 2023}}",

The members of the program were singers who had been influenced by the American rock n' roll of the late 1950s and [[British Invasion]] bands of the 1960s, although the music often became softer, more naïve versions with light, romantic lyrics aimed at teenagers. They were [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Erasmo Carlos]] and [[Wanderléa]], with other bands and musicians appearing on the show as guests.\n\nThe style became popularly known as \"[[iê-iê-iê]]\", a term that, like French [[yé-yé]], is most likely based on the frequent \"yeah\" cries heard in songs of the period (for instance, the [[Beatles]]' \"She loves you/Yeah yeah yeah\"). Iê-iê-iê was often considered a lesser genre, inferior to the more sophisticated [[bossa nova]] and [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]] music of the period. Jovem Guarda also became a lucrative business thanks to merchandise that explored its theme and even a couple of themed motion pictures were shot during the period, thus reinforcing the idea of its lack of artistic integrity.\n\n[[Jorge Ben]] explored Jovem Guarda-style rock during the 1960s, fusing it with [[samba]] and [[R&B]], before his music's development into [[samba rock]].",

It emerged in the 1990s as a form of [[youth subculture]], with Korean musicians taking influence from Western [[Electronic dance music|dance music]], [[hip-hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. Today, K-pop commonly refers to the musical output of [[teen idol]] acts, chiefly [[girl group]]s and [[boy band]]s, who emphasize [[Visual communication|visual appeal]] and [[Performing arts|performance]]. As a [[Pop music|pop]] genre, K-pop is characterized by its [[Melody|melodic]] quality and cultural hybridity.\n\nK-pop can trace its origins to \"rap dance\", a fusion of hip-hop, [[techno]] and rock popularized by the group [[Seo Taiji and Boys]], whose experimentation helped to modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene in the early 1990s. Their popularity with teenagers incentivized the music industry to focus on this demographic, with [[Lee Soo-man]] of [[SM Entertainment]] developing the [[Korean idol]] system in the late 1990s and creating acts like [[H.O.T.]] and [[S.E.S. (group)|S.E.S.]], which marked the \"first generation\" of K-pop. By the early 2000s, [[TVXQ]] and [[BoA]] achieved success in Japan and gained traction for the genre overseas.\n\nAs a component of the [[Korean Wave]], the international popularity of K-pop by the 2010s can be attributed to the rise of [[social media]]. In 2019, South Korea ranked sixth among the top ten music markets worldwide, with artists [[BTS]] and [[Blackpink]] leading the growth. 2020 was a record-breaking year for South Korea when it experienced a 44.8% growth and became the fastest-growing major market of the year.\n\nDespite heavy influence from [[American popular music|American pop music]], some have argued that K-pop maintains a distinctness in mood and energy. The \"Koreanness\" of K-pop has been debated in recent years, with an increasing share of Western songwriters, non-Korean artists, songs in English and marketing for a global audience. Some authors have theorized K-pop as a new kind of \"transnational culture\" with \"global dissemination\".\n\nK-pop is known for its tight managerial control. It has been criticized for its [[commercialism]] and treatment of artists. The industry is dominated by four major companies—SM, [[YG Entertainment|YG]], [[JYP Entertainment|JYP]] and [[Hybe Corporation|Hybe]]. In the 2020s, the genre has been marked by greater artist autonomy and companies localizing their production methods overseas; groups like [[JO1]] and [[Katseye]] have resulted from this [[globalization]].{{TOC limit|3}}",

The hard-[[Swing (jazz performance style)|swinging]], bluesy transition style is bracketed by [[Count Basie]], who in 1929 signed with [[Bennie Moten]]'s Kansas City Orchestra, and Kansas City native [[Charlie Parker]], who promoted the bebop style in America.\n\nKansas City is known as one of the most popular \"cradles of jazz\". Other cities include [[New Orleans]], [[Chicago]], [[St. Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]. Kansas City was known for the organized musicians of the Local 627 A.F.M., which controlled a number of venues in the city. Almost every jazz history depicts Kansas City jazz as a fertile ground for the development of big bands, virtuosic performances, and legendary performers. In the 1920s was a [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the south and the search for musical work in Kansas City, Missouri, where the Black population rose from 23,500 to 42,000 between 1912 and 1940. Russell, Diggs, and Pearson have well documented how the vice district expanded within black neighborhoods of Kansas City, resulting in economic success for jazz musicians. Many musicians from the Southwest moved to Kansas City for its plentiful jobs. \"Nightclubs in Kansas City served up prostitution, gambling, and narcotics along with liquor\". \n\nThe community hosted a vibrant jazz and blues music scene, attracting musicians from across the country. The community prominently shaped the development of jazz and blues and hosted some of the era's most pivotal musicians. Edward Murrow wrote in the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'': \"If you want to see sin, forget about Paris and go to Kansas City\". A variety of clubs and cabarets, dance halls, and jazz venues arose in Kansas City, including the Paseo Room, Pla-Mor Ballroom, Reno Club, Amos 'n' Andy, Boulevard Lounge, Cherry Blossom, Chocolate Bar, Lone Star, Elk's Rest, Old Kentucky Bar-B-Que, Sunset, Subway, Spinning Wheel, Hawaiian Gardens, Street's Blue Room, Hell's Kitchen, The Hi Hat, and the Hey-Hay. Kansas City became known for \"small, intimate\" clubs that hosted frequent, \"long-lasting jam sessions\". Becker said that Kansas City \"drew its vitality from the political corruption which made nightlife possible\". Kansas City's concentration of outstanding jazz talent had made it a potential competitor to New York and Chicago by the middle of the 1930s.",

The audience also gives money directly to the singer on stage. These characteristic performances have given the notion of koplo as \"immoral\" music in the eyes of traditional dangdut musicians.{{sfn|Weintraub|2013}}{{sfn|Amzy|Pramudita|Pratama|2019}} [[Rhoma Irama]], one of the most influential dangdut singers also known as \"the king of dangdut\", repeatedly criticized koplo during the early 2000s and attempted to distance it from the general dangdut genre.\n\nNevertheless, koplo has become one of the most popular musical genres in Indonesia, especially with the advent of pop koplo which does not employ overtly sexual performances. Some of the pioneering koplo musicians include [[Inul Daratista]] who popularized koplo in the 2000s.

Plank oversaw kosmische recordings such as [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'', [[Neu!]]'s ''[[Neu! 75]]'', and [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]'s ''[[Zuckerzeit]]''.\n\nSeveral of these artists would later distance themselves from the term. Other names for the style, and for sub-genres were the \"Berlin School\" and the \"Dusseldorf School\", both of which are recognised and actively contributed to by artists such as Node, Martin Sturtzer, Propaganda, Kraftwerk, Tannheuser and Fritz Mayr, from the 1980s through to the present day. The style would later lead to the development of [[new-age music]], with which it shared several characteristics.{{sfn|Adelt|2016}} It would also exert lasting influence on subsequent [[electronica]] and [[experimental rock]], especially [[post-rock]] in the 1990s.",

Its importance stems from its association with the indigenous cultures that inhabited these islands prior to the influences of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], [[Christianity]] or [[Western world|the West]], making kulintang the most developed tradition of Southeast Asian archaic [[gong-chime]] ensembles.\n\nTechnically, ''kulintang'' is the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]], [[Lumad people|Lumad]] [[Ternate]], [[Moluccas]], and Timor term for the [[idiophone]] of metal gong kettles which are laid horizontally upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the ''kulintang'' is also called ''kolintang'' by the people of  [[Maranao]] and [[Sulawesi]], ''kulintango'' by [[Mongondow people|Mongondow]], ''[[Tifa totobuang|totobuang]]'' by those in central [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], ''kulintangan'' and ''gulintangan'' by those in [[Brunei]], [[Sabah]], [[North Kalimantan]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. Gulintangan or gulingtangan literally means rolling hands in [[Brunei]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sulu]].\n\nBy the twentieth century, the term ''kulintang'' had a  come to denote an entire Maguindanao ensemble of five to six instruments. Traditionally the Maguindanao term for the entire ensemble is ''basalen'' or ''palabunibunyan'', the latter term meaning “an ensemble of loud instruments” or “music-making” or in this case “music-making using a kulintang.”",

Due to its adjacency to [[disco]], the earliest days of [[Hip-hop music|hip-hop]] had a close relation to [[LGBTQ]] subcultures, and multiple LGBTQ DJs have played a role in popularizing hip-hop. Since the early 2000s there has been a flourishing community of LGBTQ hip-hop artists, activists, and performers breaking barriers in the mainstream music industry. Despite this early involvement, hip-hop has long been portrayed as one of the least LGBTQ-friendly genres of music, with a significant body of the genre containing [[homophobic]] views and [[anti-gay]] lyrics, with mainstream artists such as [[Eminem]] and [[Tyler, the Creator]] (whose own sexuality has been repeatedly questioned throughout his career) having used casual homophobia in their lyrics, including usages of the word ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]''. Attitudes towards homosexuality in [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] culture have historically been negative, with slang that uses homosexuality as a punchline such as \"sus\", \"[[no homo]]\", and \"pause\" being heard in hip-hop lyrics from some of the industry's biggest artists.\n\nLabels such as '''homo hop''' or '''queer hip-hop''' group all artists identifying as members of the LGBTQ community into a subgenre of hip-hop based solely on their sexuality. These subgenre labels are not marked by any specific production style, as artists within it may simultaneously be associated with virtually any other subgenre of hip-hop, or may also make music that falls outside the subgenre entirely. Rather, the terms are defined by a direct engagement with [[LGBTQ culture]] in elements such as the lyrical themes or the artist's visual identity and presentation.\n\nArtists who have been labelled as part of the genre have, however, varied in their acceptance of the terminology. Some have supported the identification of a distinct phenomenon of \"LGBTQ hip-hop\" as an important tool for promoting LGBTQ visibility in popular music, while others have criticized it for trivializing their music as a \"niche\" interest that circumscribed their appeal to mainstream music fans.\n\nMany artists have contributed to the increased visibility and social acceptance of the LGBTQ community's presence in hip-hop music, most notably [[Frank Ocean]], who penned an open letter addressing his sexuality in 2012. There has also been an increased presence of LGBTQ supporters in the mainstream hip-hop community, including Eminem, [[Jay-Z]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[Kanye West]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[Jack Harlow]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Macklemore]], and [[Ryan Lewis]].",

Makossa uses [[guitar]] [[accompaniment]]s, in the forms of [[Solo guitar|solo]] and [[rhythm guitar]], with a main singer ([[lead vocalist]]) and a [[choir]] of [[backup singers]], with the focus being on the [[Timbre|texture]] of the guitar, the role it plays in the [[song]], the relationship between it and other [[Musical instrument|instruments]] (including the [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Drum kit|drum set]], [[Brass instrument|horns]], [[synthesizers]], etc.), the [[Lyrics|lyrical content]] and [[languages]] sung as well as their relationship (as far as timbre goes) with the music, the uses of various [[percussion instrument]]s, including the [[bottle]], the [[Groove (music)|groove]] of the bass as well as the drums, and the use of [[Music technology|technical knowledge]] and [[microprocessor]]s to make the music. It is in common time (4/4) for the vast majority of cases. Language-wise, it is typically sung in [[French language|French]], [[Duala language|Duala]] or [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin English]]. Tempo-wise, it is typically in between 130 and 170 [[Tempo|BPM]]. It traditionally consisted of [[Guitar picking|guitar-picking techniques]] that borrows from [[bikutsi]]; with a guitar-structure of a guitar switching from solo to rhythm from [[assiko]]; supplanted with complex bass grooves, and gradually picked up on brass section, from [[funk]] and later in the 70s, string section, from disco. It along with this acquired the [[sebene]] from Congolese rumba. In the 1980s makossa had a wave of mainstream success across [[Africa]] and to a lesser extent abroad. It is considered to be one of the greatest Cameroonian and even African \"adventures\" as a music.\n\nMakossa, which in some accounts is said to mean \"the contortions\" and others to mean \"(I) dance\" in the [[Douala language|Duala language]], originated from a [[Duala people|Duala]] [[dance]] called the ''kossa''. Emmanuel Nelle Eyoum started using the refrain ''kossa kossa'' in his songs with his group \"Los Calvinos\". The style began to take shape in the 1950s though the first recordings were not seen until a decade later. There were artists such as [[Eboa Lotin]], François Missé Ngoh and especially [[Manu Dibango]], who popularised makossa throughout the world with his song \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" in 1972. It is the most [[Sampled (music)|sampled]] [[Africa]]n song, in history to date. The chant from the song, ''mamako, mamasa, maka makossa'', was later used by [[Michael Jackson]] in \"[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]\" in 1983. In 2007, [[Rihanna]] similarly sampled it too for [[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|\"Don't Stop The Music]]\". Many other performers followed suit. The 2010 World cup also brought makossa to the international stage as [[Shakira]] sampled the [[Golden Sounds]] popular song \"[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)]]\".",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Marabi''' is a style of music and dance form that evolved and emerged in [[South Africa]] between the 1890s and 1920s.\n\nThe early part of the century saw the increasing urbanisation of black South Africans in mining centres such as the gold mining area around [[Johannesburg]] - the [[Witwatersrand]]. This led to the development of township slums or ghettos, and out of this hardship came forth new forms of music, marabi and [[kwela]] amongst others.\n \nMarabi was the name given to a [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American [[jazz]], [[ragtime]] and [[blues]], with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. Indeed, as with early jazz in the US, the music incurred the displeasure of the establishment. Nonetheless, as with early jazz, the lilting melodies and catchy rhythms of marabi found their way into the sounds of popular dance bands with a distinctively South African style.\n\nThe sound of marabi was intended to draw people into local bars or \"[[shebeen]]s\" (where illicit drinks like [[skokiaan]] were sold), and to get them dancing. \"Shebeens\" resemble the American speakeasies of the prohibition era where American Jazz was very popular.\n\nMarabi is characterised by a few simple chords repeated in varying vamping patterns that could go on for a long time; repetitive harmonic patterns being typical of traditional African musics. This was the case so people could dance for extended periods of time without having to know the songs well. People were able to pick up the feel and rhythm of the song after a few times through the progression.\n\nThe most famous of marabi's venues were the shebeens, and the weekend-long slumyard parties. For almost everyone outside ghetto life, however, marabi and its subculture were shunned. Associated with illegality, police raids, sex and a desperately impoverished working class, marabi was thought of as a corrupting menace and for this reason, it is no surprise that no early marabi musicians were recorded.\n\nA reflection of this music can be heard in the music of such Cape Jazz performers as [[Basil Coetzee]] or [[Abdullah Ibrahim]]. The beginnings of broadcast radio intended for black listeners and the growth of an indigenous recording industry helped propel such sounds to immense popularity from the 1930s onward.\n\nSuch bands produced the first generation of professional black musicians in South Africa. Over the years, marabi developed into early [[mbaqanga]], arguably the most distinctive form of South African music. This has continued to influence South African music since then, from the jazz performers of the post-war years to the more populist township forms of the 1980s and onwards. With the infusion of more traditional influences, marabi has lost much of its link to the style's jazz roots and is now part of the African music culture as opposed to South African Jazz.\n\nThe synthesis of American jazz with marabi produced the [[tsaba-tsaba]] style in the 1940s, best known for the international hit \"[[Skokiaan]]\".\n\nOne of the most notable musical pieces that contain a hint of Marabi is Paul Simon's 1986 epic, ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. The Garland Encyclopedia of Music says, \"Fundamental to much of the musical mix (of Graceland) was the influence of the African-American jazz, introduced into South Africa by transnational record-distribution networks in the 1920s. Most South African jazz musicians could not read scores, so they developed their own jazz flavor, mixing American swing with African melodies.  The dynamic blend of african-american structure and African style became the basis for early South African township jazz known as marabi.\"",

The usual mariachi group today consists of as many as eight violins, two trumpets and at least one guitar, including a high-pitched [[Mexican vihuela|Mexican Vihuela]] and an acoustic bass guitar called a [[guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]], and all players take turns singing lead and doing backup vocals.\n\nDuring the 19th- and 20th-century migrations from rural areas into [[Guadalajara]], along with the Mexican government's promotion of national culture, mariachi came to be recognized as a distinctly Mexican [[son mexicano|''son'']]. Modifications of the music include influences from other music, such as [[polka]]s and [[waltz]]es, the addition of trumpets, and the use of [[charro outfit]]s by mariachi musicians. The musical style began to take on national prominence in the first half of the 20th century, with its promotion at presidential inaugurations and on the radio in the 1920s. In 2011, [[UNESCO]] recognized mariachi as an [[Intangible cultural heritage|Intangible Cultural Heritage]]; it joins six other entries on the Mexican list.\n\nSong genres performed by mariachi ensembles include [[ranchera]]s, [[corrido]]s, [[cumbia]]s, [[Bolero#Cuba|boleros]], [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]], [[Son mexicano|sones]], [[huapango]]s, [[jarabe]]s, [[Danzón|danzones]], [[joropo]]s, [[pasodoble]]s, [[March (music)|marches]], [[polka]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[Schottis|chotís]].

This subgenre reached its height towards the middle of the 1970s when it achieved some mainstream success in Britain, but within a few years most groups had either disbanded, or were absorbed into the wider movements of [[progressive folk]] and [[progressive rock]].  Nevertheless, the genre had a considerable impact within progressive rock where early music, and [[medievalism]] in general, was a major influence and through that in the development of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. More recently medieval folk rock has revived in popularity along with other forms of medieval inspired music such as [[Dark Wave]] orientated [[neo-Medieval music]] and [[medieval metal]].",

It is common to use different samples to maintain and sometimes even ridicule the original.

This backing beat is kept basic so as to simplify [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] and to not compete with the music. These mixes are usually several minutes long at minimum, going up to a half-hour or an hour, or even more sometimes.\n\nAccording to author Eduardo Navas, megamixes are constructed with the same principles as [[medley (music)|medleys]], but differ in that while medleys typically utilise single bands to play the excerpted compositions, megamixes use DJ producers to sample recognisable sections of songs and then sequence them \"to create what is essentially an extended [[sound collage|collage]]: an electronic medley consisting of samples from pre-existing sources.\" The purpose of the megamix, he argues, is \"to present a musical collage riding on a uniting groove to create a type of [[pastiche (music)|pastiche]] that allows the listener to recall a whole time period and not necessarily one single artist or composition.\"\n\n[[Ultimix]] is known for \"flashback medleys,\" producing at least one or two every year based on popular songs of the year.

The \"artist megamix\" is also popular, including songs spanning a musician's career, with prolific artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] having more than one, usually from different remixers. [[Duran Duran]] created a megamix single (\"[[Burning the Ground]]\") from their own hits for the 1989 greatest hits album ''[[Decade (Duran Duran album)|Decade]]''. Subsequently, artists such as [[GHV2 Megamix|Madonna]], [[Megamix (Britney Spears song)|Britney Spears]], and [[Janet Megamix 04|Janet Jackson]] have also released megamixes as singles in order to promote their [[greatest hits]] albums or in the latter's case, [[studio album]].

The genre features the heaviness of death metal but with highly melodic or harmonized guitar riffs and solos, and often features high-pitched shrieked vocals (differing from traditional death metal) alongside the low-pitched growls commonly featured in traditional death metal. Pioneered by the English heavy metal band [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] with their 1993 album ''[[Heartwork]]'', melodic death metal developed further in Sweden (developed by bands like [[At the Gates]], [[Dark Tranquillity]], and [[In Flames]]) in the mid-1990s. The [[Swedish death metal]] scene did much to popularise the style, soon centering in the \"[[Swedish death metal#Gothenburg scene|Gothenburg metal]]\" scene. At the Gates' ''[[Slaughter of the Soul]]'', Dark Tranquillity's ''[[The Gallery (album)|The Gallery]]'', and In Flames' ''[[The Jester Race]]'', all released in the mid-1990s, were highly influential albums in melodic death metal, with At the Gates and In Flames being the two most common influences on North American 2000s heavy metal bands. Many American heavy metal bands emulated At the Gates' sound, resulting in the usage of the phrase \"At the Gates worship\".\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, many melodic death metal bands emerged, including [[Children of Bodom]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Amon Amarth]], [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Insomnium]], and [[Soilwork]]. In the 2000s decade, melodic death metal achieved popularity among heavy metal fans, starting with the release of In Flames' 2002 album ''[[Reroute to Remain]]'', which showed a change to a more eclectic sound while retaining the band's melodic death metal sound. Many other melodic death metal bands quickly had chart success.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, [[melodic metalcore]], a subgenre of [[metalcore]] that combines the genre with melodic death metal, achieved popularity with the chart success and sales success of bands like [[Killswitch Engage]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], and [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]].

The style often includes guitar harmonies, riffs using octave chords, as well as [[broken chord]]s. Additionally, lyrics tend towards [[intellectualism]], often being politically conscious or narrative, with [[concept albums]] sometimes being prominent. Bands in the genre also have a tendency to take influence from a range of genres including [[emo]], [[post-punk]], [[screamo]], [[pop-punk]], [[metalcore]], [[post-rock]] and [[gothic rock]].\n\nIn the early and mid–1980s, bands including [[The Faith (American band)|the Faith]], [[Descendents]], [[Dag Nasty]], [[Gorilla Biscuits]] and [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]] were amongst the first hardcore bands to put an emphasis on their melodies. In 1988, [[Bad Religion]] incorporated more melodic elements into their music with their third album ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was widely influential, and reshaped the [[skate punk]] genre from its purely hardcore origins into a subgenre of melodic hardcore. During the 1990s, this melodic skate punk style became one of the most prominent styles in punk, with [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and [[Strung Out]] emerging as forefront acts. 1988 also saw the formation of [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]] and [[Turning Point (American band)|Turning Point]] who pioneered an additional style of melodic hardcore, routed in [[youth crew]], [[emo]] and [[tough guy hardcore]]. This style began to gain prominence towards the end of the 1990s with [[In My Eyes (band)|In My Eyes]], [[Bane (band)|Bane]] and [[Reach the Sky]].\n\nDuring the 2000s, the genre became the most prominent style in the hardcore scene, and diversified into a variety of styles including the [[horror punk]] and gothic rock informed style of [[AFI (band)|AFI]] and [[the Nerve Agents]], the heavy and nihilist style of [[American Nightmare (band)|American Nightmare]] and [[the Hope Conspiracy]], the more melodic and punk-leaning style of [[Rise Against]] and [[Strike Anywhere]], the [[positive hardcore]] style of [[Have Heart]] and [[Verse (band)|Verse]] and the emotional style of [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]] and [[Touché Amoré]]. Around 2009, the genre became less prominent in the American hardcore scene, but continued in the United Kingdom with [[Dead Swans]] and [[While She Sleeps]], and in the American [[metalcore]] scene with [[Hundredth (band)|Hundredth]], [[The Ghost Inside (band)|the Ghost Inside]] and [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]]. During the 2010s, British and Australian melodic hardcore bands including [[Casey (band)|Casey]] and [[Holding Absence]] pushed the genre closer to post-rock.

Merengue was inscribed on November 30, 2016, in the representative list of the [[Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] of [[UNESCO]].\n\nMerengue was developed in the middle of the 1800s, originally played with European [[stringed instruments]] ([[bandurria]] and guitar). Years later, the stringed instruments were replaced by the [[accordion]], thus conforming, together with the [[güira]] and the [[Tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]], the instrumental structure of the typical merengue ensemble. This set, with its three instruments, represents the synthesis of the three cultures that made up the idiosyncrasy of Dominican culture. The European influence is represented by the accordion, the African by the Tambora, which is a two-head drum, and the [[Taino]] or aboriginal by the güira.\n\nThe genre was later promoted by [[Rafael Trujillo]], the dictator from 1930 to 1961, who turned it into the national music and dance style of the Dominican Republic. In the [[United States]] it was first popularized by New York–based groups and bandleaders like Rafael Petiton Guzman, beginning in the 1930s, and [[Angel Viloria]] y su Conjunto Típico Cibaeño in the 1950s. It was during the Trujillo era that the merengue \"Compadre Pedro Juan\", by [[Luis Alberti (musician)|Luis Alberti]], became an international hit and standardized the 2-part form of the merengue.\n\nFamous merengue artists and groups include [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Milly Quezada]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Rubby Pérez]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Bonny Cepeda]], [[Johnny Ventura]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[La Mákina]], [[Miriam Cruz]], [[Las Chicas Del Can]], [[Kinito Mendez]], [[Jossie Esteban y la Patrulla 15]], [[Pochy y su Cocoband]], [[Cuco Valoy]], [[Ramón Orlando]], [[Alex Bueno]], The New York Band, [[Elvis Crespo]], [[Olga Tañón]], [[Gisselle]], [[Conjunto Quisqueya]] and [[Grupomanía]].\n\nThe popularity of merengue has been increasing in [[Venezuela]]. Venezuelan Merengueros include Roberto Antonio, Miguel Moly, Natusha, [[Porfi Jiménez]], [[Billo Frometa|Billo's Caracas Boys]], and [[Los Melodicos]]. Merengue is also popular in the coastal city of [[Guayaquil]] in [[Ecuador]].\n\nThe new line of merengue created in [[New York City]] has become very popular amongst younger listeners. Known as \"Merengue de Mambo\", its proponents include Omega, Oro 24, Los Ficos, Los Gambinos, Alberto Flash, Mala Fe, Henry Jimenez, and Aybar.\n\nAlthough the etymology of ''merengue'' can be disputed, there are a few theories about where the word might have derived from. One suggestion is that the term derives from meringue, a dish made from egg whites that is popular in Latin-American countries. The sound made by the whipping of eggs supposedly resembles the guiro used in merengue.",

Metalcore typically has aggressive verses and melodic choruses, combined with [[Breakdown (music)|breakdowns]] – which are slow, intense passages conducive to [[moshing]]. Other defining traits are low-tuned, percussive guitar riffs, [[double bass drumming]], and polished production. Vocalists typically switch between roaring or [[Screaming (music)|screaming]] and clean, melodic, emotional singing. Lyrics are often personal, introspective and emotive.\n\nIn the late 1980s to early 1990s, pioneering bands were founded such as [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]], [[Earth Crisis]] and [[Converge (band)|Converge]], whose hardcore punk-leaning style is sometimes referred to as '''metallic hardcore'''. These bands took influence from a range of styles and genres such as hardcore punk, [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]]. During the decade, the genre diversified, with Converge, [[the Dillinger Escape Plan]], [[Botch (band)|Botch]] and [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] pioneering [[mathcore]], while [[Overcast (band)|Overcast]], [[Shadows Fall]] and [[Darkest Hour (band)|Darkest Hour]] merged the genre with [[melodic death metal]] to create [[melodic metalcore]]. \n\nDuring the early 2000s, melodic metalcore bands such as  [[Killswitch Engage]], [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]], [[Atreyu]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]] and [[Parkway Drive]] found mainstream popularity. In the subsequent years, the genre saw increased success through [[social networking]] on [[Myspace]] and [[internet meme]]s such as [[crabcore]]. During this time, artists began to draw influence from a wide variety of sources, which led to genre cultivating a plethora of fusion genres including [[electronicore]], [[deathcore]], [[Nintendocore]], [[progressive metalcore]] and [[nu metalcore]]. In the 2010s and through to the 2020s, the genre saw even greater commercial success, with albums by [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Architects (British band)|Architects]], [[Asking Alexandria]], [[the Devil Wears Prada (band)|the Devil Wears Prada]] and [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]] penetrating the top 10 of international albums charts.",

      "wikitext_description": "Motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the [[trademark]] \"The Motown sound\". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown sound typically featured [[tambourine]]s to accent the [[back beat]], prominent and often melodic electric bass guitar lines, distinctive [[Melody|melodic]] and [[Chord (music)|chord]] structures, and a [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] singing style that originated in [[gospel music]]. In 1971, [[Jon Landau]] wrote in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\". Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, [[melisma]]tic vocal riffs were avoided. Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \"[[KISS principle]]\" (keep it simple, stupid).\n\nThe Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy, the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\" and \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". In several cases, producers would rework tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer [[Norman Whitfield]] did with \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" and the Temptations' \"[[Ain't Too Proud to Beg]]\".\n\nMany of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for [[the Supremes]], were written by the songwriting trio of [[Holland–Dozier–Holland]] ([[Lamont Dozier]] and brothers [[Brian Holland|Brian]] and [[Eddie Holland]]). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included [[Norman Whitfield]], [[William \"Mickey\" Stevenson]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Barrett Strong]], [[Ashford & Simpson|Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson]], [[Frank Wilson (musician)|Frank Wilson]], [[Pam Sawyer|Pamela Sawyer]] & [[Gloria Jones]], James Dean & [[William Weatherspoon]], [[Johnny Bristol]], [[Harvey Fuqua]], [[Gil Askey]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and Gordy himself.\n\nThe style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[the Foundations]]. In the United Kingdom, the Motown sound became the basis of the [[northern soul]] movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown sound had little to do with Detroit:\n{{blockquote|People would listen to it, and they'd say, 'Aha, they use more bass. Or they use more drums.' Bullshit. When we were first successful with it, people were coming from Germany, France, Italy, Mobile, Alabama. From New York, Chicago, California. From ''everywhere''. Just to record in Detroit. They figured it was in the air, that if they came to Detroit and recorded on the freeway, they'd get the Motown sound. Listen, the Motown sound to me is ''not'' an audible sound. It's spiritual, and it comes from the people that make it happen. What other people didn't realize is that we just had one studio there, but we recorded in [[Chicago]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], New York, L.A.—almost every big city. And we still got the sound.<ref>Hirshey, Gerri (1994 [1984]). ''Nowhere to Run: The Story of Soul Music''. New York: Da Capo Press. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-306-80581-2}}.</ref>}}",

The dramatic unfolding in performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and initiated listeners.\n\nThree major schools of mugham performance existed from the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the regions of Karabakh, Shirvan, and Baku. The town of [[Shusha]] of [[Karabakh]], was particularly renowned for this art.\n\nA short selection of Azerbaijani mugham, played on the wind instrument [[balaban (instrument)|balaban]], was included among many cultural achievements of humanity on the [[Voyager Golden Record]], which was attached to the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft to represent world music.\n\nIn 2003, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed Azerbaijani Mugham a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|\"Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\"]].

      "wikitext_description": "'''Music hall''' is a type of British theatrical entertainment that was most popular from the early [[Victorian era]], beginning around 1850, through the [[World War I|Great War]]. It faded away after 1918 as the halls rebranded their entertainment as [[Variety show|variety]]. Perceptions of a distinction in Britain between bold and scandalous music hall entertainment and subsequent, more respectable variety entertainment differ. Music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts, and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. In North America [[vaudeville]] was in some ways analogous to British music hall, featuring rousing songs and comic acts.\n\nOriginating in saloon bars within pubs during the 1830s, music hall entertainment became increasingly popular with audiences. So much so, that during the 1850s some public houses were demolished, and specialised music hall theatres developed in their place. These theatres were designed chiefly so that people could consume food and alcohol and smoke tobacco in the auditorium while the entertainment took place, with the cheapest seats located in the gallery. This differed from the conventional type of theatre, which seats the audience in stalls with a separate bar-room. Major music halls were based around London. Early examples included: the [[Canterbury Music Hall]] in [[Lambeth]], [[Wilton's Music Hall]] in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], and The Middlesex in [[Drury Lane]], otherwise known as the Old Mo. By the mid-19th century, the halls cried out for many new and catchy songs. As a result professional songwriters were enlisted to provide the music for a plethora of star performers, such as [[Marie Lloyd]], [[Dan Leno]], [[Little Tich]], and [[George Leybourne]]. All manner of other entertainment was performed: male and female impersonators, [[Lion comique|lions comiques]], mime artists and impressionists, trampoline acts, and comic pianists (such as [[John Orlando Parry]] and [[George Grossmith]]) were just a few of the many types of entertainments the audiences could expect to find over the next forty years.\n\nThe [[Music Hall Strike of 1907]] was an important industrial conflict. It was a dispute between artists and stage hands on one hand, and theatre managers on the other. The halls had recovered by the start of the First World War and were used to stage charity events in aid of the war effort. Music hall entertainment continued after the war, but became less popular due to upcoming [[jazz]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[big-band]] dance music acts. Licensing restrictions had also changed, and [[Prohibition|drinking was banned]] from the auditorium. A new type of music hall entertainment had arrived, in the form of variety, and many music hall performers failed to make the transition. They were deemed old-fashioned, and with the closure of many halls, music hall entertainment ceased and modern-day variety began.",

      "wikitext_description": "Under Kim Il Sung's era, only ideologically correct music was allowed. [[Jazz]] in particular was considered out of bounds. Many artists however found their way around these limitations by writing ideologically correct lyrics while taking liberties with the score. Under Kim Jong Il, previously forbidden genres, even jazz, became permissible and encouraged.\n\nMany North Korean pop songs are usually performed by young female singers with an electric ensemble, percussionist, and accompanying singers and dancers. However, there are also male singers or a chorus in community or company pop bands. Some North Korean pop songs such as \"[[Whistle (North Korean song)|Whistle]]\"—set to the lyrics of North Korean poet [[Cho Ki-chon]]—have become popular in South Korea. Common lyrical themes include military might (\"We Shall Hold Bayonets More Firmly\", \"Look At Us!\", \"One Against a Hundred\"), economic production and thrift (\"The Joy of Bumper Harvest Overflows Amidst the Song of Mechanisation\", \"Attain the Cutting Edge (The [[Numerical control|CNC]] Song)\", \"I Also Raise Chickens\", \"Potato Pride\", \"[[Chollima]] on the Wing\"), patriotism (\"My Country Is the Best\", \"We Have Nothing To Envy\", \"[[Onwards Toward the Final Victory]]\") and glorification of the party and leaders (\"[[Where Are You, Dear General?]]\", \"No Motherland Without You\", \"[[Don't Ask My Name]]\", \"[[The General Uses Warp]]\", \"[[Footsteps (Ri Jong-o song)|Footsteps]]\"). Songs like \"We Are One\" and \"Reunification Rainbow\" sing of the hopes for [[Korean reunification]]. There are also songs with more casual themes, such as \"Women Are Flowers\" and \"Ballad of Gold Mountains\".\n\nIn 2012, North Korea's first major girl band, the [[Moranbong Band]], made its world debut. It is a group of about sixteen North Korean women (eleven instrumentalists and five singers) which was hand-selected by [[Kim Jong Un]].\n\nBBC radio disc jockey [[Andy Kershaw]] noted, on a visit to North Korea with [[Koryo Tours]] in 2003, that the only recordings available were by the pop singers [[Chon Hye-yong|Jon Hye-yong]], [[Kim Kwang-suk]], [[Jo Kum-hwa]] and [[Ri Pun-hui]], and the groups [[Wangjaesan Light Music Band]], the [[Mansudae Art Troupe]] and the [[Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble]], who play in a style Kershaw refers to as \"light instrumental with popular vocal\". There is also the [[State Symphony Orchestra of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|State Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Sea of Blood Opera Company]], two choruses, an orchestra and an ensemble dedicated to [[Isang Yun]]'s compositions, all in Pyongyang. The [[Pyongyang Film Studios]] also produces many instrumental songs for its films, and several programs on [[Korean Central Television]] have music made and performed by the Central Radio and Television Orchestra.\n\nIn 2010, a [[brutal death metal]] group purporting to be from North Korea, called Red War (붉은전쟁), released a three-track demo online. However, as of 2014 the group are believed to be disbanded. The metal music archive Spirit of Metal currently lists two bands that claim to originate from North Korea, Red War and the [[pornogrind]] band Teagirl.\n\nNorth Korean [[pop music]] is available for visitors to [[Pyongyang]] at the [[Koryo Hotel]] or [[Number One Department Store]], as well as gift shops in tourist destinations. International and Western music can be enjoyed by locals and tourists at the [[Grand People's Study House]], Pyongyang's central library.",

      "wikitext_description": "Mustard's production style has been described as an up-tempo, radio-friendly, club-oriented, catchy hip hop style which he calls \"ratchet music\". Mustard's body of work has been recognized by critics as sonically cohesive and recognizable in that many of his tracks have recurring, identifiable motifs. Most apparent is his producer signature \"Mustard on that beat, ho!\" which prefaces the beat drop in many of his songs. This signature is often strategically placed to span the third and fourth [[counting (music)|counts]] of the [[bar (music)|measure]] preceding the song's [[drop (music)|drop]] to make it more [[catchiness|catchy]]. On a compositional level, however, Mustard's motifs also include: an ambient chant of \"Hey!\" on the off-beats in the background of his music; the emphasized, minimalist bass synth opening to many songs (most notably on \"[[My Nigga]]\", \"[[R.I.P. (Young Jeezy song)|R.I.P.]]\", and \"[[Rack City]]\"), [[Roland TR-808|808]] kicks and the use of crisp hand-claps and snap-snares.\n\nMustard uses the music production software [[Reason (software)|Reason]], first using 5, 6 and currently using 6.5. In an interview with [[The Fader]] magazine he stated, \"With this ratchet music, I'm trying to create my own sound. I want to make this to where it can't leave, this is something that everybody's gonna get used to. Like how everybody got used to [[Lil Jon]] or Luke. I don't want it to be something that comes and goes, I want it to be something that's here forever like a real culture.\"\n\nAs a result of the recognizably and commonality between many of Mustard's chart-topping singles, a number of artists who employ production similar to DJ Mustard's have been criticized for lack of originality and plagiarism. In a July 2014 interview with [[Tim Westwood]], the rapper [[YG (rapper)|YG]], whose album ''[[My Krazy Life]]'' was mostly produced by Mustard, stated that [[Iggy Azalea]]'s song \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\" 'jocked' Mustard's style.\nLike many of Mustard's songs, the song includes a minimalist [[G-funk]] style synth and samples a layered \"Hey\" voice chant. He has been compared to rap producers like Dr Dre and many old rappers from the golden age of hip hop.",

[[List of National Socialist black metal artists|NSBM artists]] typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]] from a [[Racialism|racialist]] viewpoint. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see their ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\". NSBM artists are a small minority within black metal. While many black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, others are indifferent or say they appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} Like [[Nazi punk]], Nazi black metal is not seen as a distinct genre, being \"distinguished only by ideology, not musical character\". \n\nNSBM artists do not always convey their political beliefs in their music, but may express their beliefs in interviews or imagery. Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] beliefs but do not express them in their music are not considered NSBM by many black-metallers, but they may be considered NSBM by outsiders. War and catastrophe are common themes in black metal, and some bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. \n\nThe emergence of NSBM in the mid 1990s is linked with the prominent [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]] musician [[Varg Vikernes]]. After his imprisonment for church burning and murder, he developed his anti-Christian beliefs into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The first black metal bands to have neo-Nazi lyrics and imagery were German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]], and Polish bands [[Infernum]] and [[Graveland]]. In the United States, [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] became involved in NSBM (the latter has since distanced themselves from the movement). As NSBM grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-right faction of [[Oi!]]. The neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]], associated with the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], started releasing NSBM albums and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kyiv]], Ukraine.",

As a term, it was coined by music industry entrepreneur [[Kedar Massenburg]] during the late 1990s to market and describe a style of music that emerged from [[Soul music|soul]] and [[contemporary R&B]]. Heavily based in soul music, neo soul is distinguished by a less conventional sound than its contemporary R&B counterpart, with incorporated elements ranging from [[funk]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and to [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[electronic music]]. It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R&B influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.\n\nNeo soul developed during the 1980s and early 1990s, by Black-Americans in the United States, as a soul revival movement. It earned mainstream success during the 1990s, with the commercial and critical breakthroughs of several artists, including [[D'Angelo]], [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[Lauryn Hill]]. Their music was marketed as an alternative to the producer-driven, digitally approached R&B of the time, although many of them were ambivalent about the term.\n\nSince its initial mainstream popularity and impact on the sound of contemporary R&B, neo soul has been expanded and diversified musically through the works of both American and international artists. Its mainstream presence declined during the 2000s, although newer artists emerged through more [[independent music|independent]] means of marketing their music. In his book ''The Essential Neo Soul'' (2010), music journalist and culture critic Chris Campbell writes that, while the genre has been \"woefully misunderstood and its artists mis-marketed\", there is \"a historical and social relevance that validates its designation as the current face of alternative progressive soul music (in both underground and overground circles), complete with a distinct origin and developmental evolution\". According to [[Mark Anthony Neal]], \"neo-soul and its various incarnations has helped to redefine the boundaries and contours of black pop.\"",

The significant economic and outward-facing cultural value of [[New Orleans]] rap stands in contrast to its struggle for institutional and academic legitimacy locally.

This persistent marginalization, despite economic success, underscores ongoing struggles for cultural legitimacy and recognition for contemporary African American art forms within historically traditional cultural centers.

It is considered a lighter and more melodic \"broadening of [[Punk subculture|punk culture]]\". It was originally used as a catch-all for the various styles of music that emerged after [[punk rock]]. Later, critical consensus favored \"new wave\" as an umbrella term involving many contemporary [[popular music]] styles, including [[synth-pop]], [[alternative dance]] and [[post-punk]]. The main new wave movement coincided with late 1970s punk and continued into the early 1980s.\n\nThe common characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, angular guitar riffs, jerky rhythms, the use of electronics, and a distinctive visual style in fashion. In the early 1980s, virtually every new pop and rock act – and particularly those that employed [[synthesizer]]s – were tagged as \"new wave\" in the United States. Although new wave shares punk's [[do-it-yourself]] philosophy, the musicians were more influenced by the styles of the 1950s along with the lighter strains of 1960s pop and were opposed to the generally abrasive, political bents of punk rock, as well as what was considered to be creatively stagnant \"[[arena rock|corporate rock]]\".\n\nNew wave commercially peaked from the late 1970s into the early 1980s with numerous major musicians and an abundance of [[one-hit wonder]]s. [[MTV]], which was launched in 1981, heavily promoted new-wave acts, boosting the genre's popularity in the United States. In the UK, new wave faded at the beginning of the 1980s with the emergence of the [[New Romantic]] movement. In the US, new wave continued into the mid-1980s but declined with the popularity of the New Romantic, [[new pop]], and new music genres. Since the 1990s, new wave resurged several times with the growing nostalgia for several new-wave-influenced musicians.",

Some of the bands considered part of the movement had formed as early as the late 1980s, but did not become influential or reach popular standing until the following decade.

The term was reportedly coined by [[Mark Hunter (musician)|Mark Hunter]], vocalist of the American metalcore band [[Chimaira]], in 2001.\n\nAlthough the term is used by the media with increasing frequency, the definition has not been finished completely.

Editor [[Alan Lewis (music journalist)|Alan Lewis]] coined the term for an article by [[Geoff Barton]] in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' to describe the emergence of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands in the mid-to-late 1970s, as [[punk rock]] declined amid the dominance of [[new wave music]].\n\nAlthough encompassing diverse styles inherited from rock music, the music of the NWOBHM is best remembered for infusing earlier heavy metal with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The [[DIY ethic|DIY]] attitude of the NWOBHM bands led to raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of [[independent record label]]s. Song lyrics were usually about [[escapism|escapist]] themes, such as mythology, fantasy, horror, and the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.\n\nThe NWOBHM began as an [[underground culture|underground]] phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. Promotion by ''Sounds'' and rock DJ [[Neal Kay]] moved it into public consciousness and toward radio airplay, recognition, and success in the UK. Its musicians and fans were largely young, white, working-class men who suffered the hardships of unemployment after the [[1973–75 recession]]. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they then created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was criticised as being local media hype for mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered the progress of the [[heavy metal subculture]], whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to [[continental Europe]], North America and Japan.\n\nBy some estimates, the movement spawned as many as a thousand heavy metal bands. Only a few survived the advent of [[MTV]] and the rise of the more commercial [[glam metal]] in the second half of the 1980s. [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Def Leppard]] became superstars; [[Motörhead]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] also had considerable success. Other groups, such as [[Diamond Head (English band)|Diamond Head]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Raven (British band)|Raven]], had more limited chart success, but influenced the successful [[extreme metal]] subgenres of the mid-to-late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.",

This period is sometimes referred to as \"Mid-school\" or \"middle school\"; associated acts included [[Gang Starr]], [[the UMC's]], [[Main Source]], [[Lord Finesse]], [[EPMD]], [[Just Ice]], [[Stetsasonic]], [[True Mathematics]], and [[Mantronix]].\n\nThe innovations of Run-D.M.C., [[MC Shan]], and LL Cool J, and New School Producers such as Larry Smith and [[Rick Rubin]] of [[Def Jam]], were quickly surpassed by [[Beastie Boys]], [[Marley Marl]] and his [[Juice Crew]] MCs, [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy]], and [[Eric B. & Rakim]]. Hip-hop production became denser, rhymes and beats faster, as the drum machine was augmented with [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]] technology. [[Rakim]] took lyrics about the art of rapping to new heights, while KRS-One and [[Chuck D]] pushed \"message rap\" towards black activism. [[Native Tongues]] artists' inclusive, sample-crowded music accompanied their positivity, [[Afrocentricity]], and playful energy.  The new school/golden age ended with the eventual commercial dominance of [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] [[gangsta rap]], particularly the emergence of the relaxed sounds of [[G-funk]] by the early nineties, while the [[East Coast hip-hop|East Coast]] scene became dominated by hardcore rappers such as the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and gangsta rappers such as [[Nas]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]]\n\nThe terms \"old school\" and \"new school\" fell into the vernacular as synonyms for \"old\" and \"new\" in hip hop, to the confusion and occasional exasperation of writers who use the terms historically.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The phrase \"Leader of The New School\", coined in hip hop by Chuck D in 1988, and given further currency by the [[eponymous]] group [[Leaders of the New School]] (who were named by Chuck D before signing with [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in 1989), remains popular.  It has been applied to artists ranging from [[Jay-Z]] to [[Lupe Fiasco]].",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Noise music''' is a genre of music that is characterised by the expressive use of [[noise]]. This type of music tends to challenge the distinction that is made in conventional musical practices between musical and non-musical sound. Noise music includes a wide range of [[music genre|musical styles]] and [[sound art|sound-based]] creative practices that feature noise as a primary [[aspect of music|aspect]].\n\nNoise music can feature acoustically or electronically generated noise, and both traditional and unconventional musical instruments. It may incorporate live machine sounds, non-musical [[Vocals#Vocal technique|vocal techniques]], physically manipulated audio media, [[Sound effect|processed sound]] recordings, [[field recording]], [[Computer music|computer-generated]] noise, [[stochastic process]], and other randomly produced electronic signals such as [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], [[Noise (radio)|static]], hiss and hum. There may also be emphasis on high volume levels and lengthy, continuous pieces. More generally noise music may contain aspects such as [[improvisation]], [[extended technique]], [[Phonaesthetics|cacophony]] and [[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminacy]]. In many instances, conventional use of melody, harmony, rhythm or pulse is dispensed with.\n\nThe [[Futurism|Futurist]] art movement (with most notably [[Luigi Russolo]]'s [[Intonarumori]] and [[The Art of Noises|''L'Arte dei Rumori'' (''The Art of Noises'')]] manifesto) was important for the development of the noise aesthetic, as was the [[Dada]] art movement (a prime example being the ''Antisymphony'' concert performed on April 30, 1919, in Berlin). In the 1920s, the French composer [[Edgard Varèse]], when [[New York Dada]] associated via [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]]'s magazine [[391 (magazine)|''391'']], conceived of the elements of his music in terms of [[Sound mass|sound-masses]]; writing in the first half of the 1920s, ''Offrandes'', ''Hyperprism'', ''[[Octandre]]'', and ''[[Intégrales]]''.{{sfn|Ouellette|1973|p=50}} Varèse thought that \"to stubbornly conditioned ears, anything new in music has always been called [[Noise in music|noise]]\", and he posed the question: \"What is music but organized noises?\"{{sfn|Varèse|1966|p=11–19}}\n\n[[Pierre Schaeffer]]'s ''[[musique concrète]]'' 1948 compositions ''[[Cinq études de bruits]]'' (''Five Noise Studies''), that began with {{Lang|fr|Etude aux Chemins de Fer}} (''Railway Study'') are key to this history. {{Lang|fr|Etude aux Chemins de Fer}} consisted of a set of recordings made at the train station Gare des Batignolles in Paris that included six steam locomotives whistling and trains accelerating and moving over the tracks. The piece was derived entirely from recorded noise sounds that were not musical, thus a realization of Russolo's conviction that noise could be an acceptable source of music. ''[[Cinq études de bruits]]'' premiered via a radio broadcast on October 5, 1948, called {{Lang|fr|Concert de bruits}} (''Noise Concert'').\n\nLater in the 1960s, the [[Fluxus]] art movement played an important role, specifically the Fluxus artists [[Joe Jones (Fluxus artist)|Joe Jones]], [[Yasunao Tone]], [[George Brecht]], [[Robert Watts (artist)|Robert Watts]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Dieter Roth]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Ocean Music'', [[Milan Knížák]]'s ''Broken Music Composition'', early [[La Monte Young]], [[Takehisa Kosugi]], and the ''Analog #1 (Noise Study)'' (1961) by Fluxus-related composer [[James Tenney]].{{sfn|Kahn|2012|pp=131–146}}\n\nContemporary noise music is often associated with extreme volume and distortion. Notable genres that exploit such techniques include [[noise rock]] and [[no wave]], [[industrial music]], [[Japanoise]], and [[postdigital]] music such as [[glitch (music)|glitch]]. In the domain of [[experimental rock]], examples include [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' and [[Sonic Youth]]. Other notable examples of composers and bands that feature noise based materials include works by [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Helmut Lachenmann]], [[Cornelius Cardew]], [[Theatre of Eternal Music]], [[Glenn Branca]], [[Rhys Chatham]], [[Ryoji Ikeda]], [[Survival Research Laboratories]], [[Whitehouse (band)|Whitehouse]], [[Coil (band)|Coil]], [[Merzbow]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Psychic TV]], [[Jean Tinguely]]'s recordings of his [[sound sculpture]] (specifically ''Bascule VII''), the music of [[Hermann Nitsch]]'s ''Orgien Mysterien Theater'', and [[La Monte Young]]'s bowed gong works from the late 1960s.",

A successor to [[ragtime]] and an outgrowth of the [[piano roll]] music of the 1910s, it can be considered a pianistic cousin of [[jazz]], which appeared around the same time. \"Nola,\" a 1915 composition by New York pianist [[Felix Arndt]], is generally considered the first novelty piano hit. Many early novelty composers were piano roll artists from the Chicago area, where two of the largest piano roll companies, QRS and Imperial, were based. While often only lightly [[Syncopation|syncopated]] or lacking syncopation entirely, novelty piano influenced the evolution of jazz. It is distinct from [[stride piano]], which was developed in New York at about the same time.\n\nThe earliest composers of novelty piano were piano roll artists seeking to sell [[piano roll]]s. These pieces started out as highly complex dance pieces with characteristic breaks, consecutive fourths, and advanced harmonies—but in contrast with ragtime and other jazz piano styles, usually relying on the use of triplets and dotted-eighth/sixteen figures, rather than the syncopated eight-note-based patterns of ragtime. Various theories exist to explain this characteristic: Typically white consumers of such music may not yet have been receptive to music of more rhythmic complexity; and/or because the almost exclusively white composers of novelty piano music had not yet absorbed the principles of syncopated music, and/or were not apt to utilize it when composing, as many of them came from [[classical music]] backgrounds where the systematic emphasis of weaker beats was uncommon.\n\nThe pioneer of the novelty piano style was [[Charley Straight]], whose compositions were issued on piano roll years before Confrey's novelty hits. Early [[Charley Straight]] novelties include \"S'more,\" \"Playmor,\" \"Nifty Nonsense,\" \"Rufenreddy,\" and \"Wild And Wooly.\"\n\nNovelty piano came most powerfully to the attention of the public in 1921, with the appearance of [[Zez Confrey|Zez Confrey's]] \"Kitten on the Keys\".  Its popularity quickly led to other Confrey works including \"Dizzy Fingers\" and \"Greenwich Witch\", and inspired other artists to issue novelty pieces. The style remained popular through the end of the decade, at which time big bands were on the rise, player pianos were in decline, and the popularity of jazz continued unabated. Novelty piano slowly succumbed to, or was absorbed into, the new orchestral styles as the piano moved away from center stage and took on more of a supporting role.\n\nNovelty piano was also generally marketed differently from the earlier ragtime form. Whilst ragtime was generally sold in the form of sheet music, it was important to keep it simple enough to be played by competent amateurs. By the mid-teens, though, two new technologies had appeared which allowed the general public to hear music as performed by skilled musicians: the piano roll and the phonograph record.  Novelty piano was developed as a vehicle to showcase the talents of these professionals, and was thus more often sold in the form of recordings and piano rolls than as sheet music. In contrast with most prior popular piano styles, it was shorn of hackneyed Victorian-era stylings, infused with chromatic flourishes, and influenced by the \"modernistic\" sounds of the [[Art Deco]] 1920s. Novelty pianists tended to be highly classically trained, and the music reflected their fondness for complex chordal ideas.\n\nProminent artists in the novelty piano genre include [[Zez Confrey]], [[Charley Straight]], [[Roy Bargy]], [[Pauline Alpert]], [[Fred Elizalde]], [[Rube Bloom]], [[Clement Doucet]], [[Max Kortlander]], [[Edythe Baker]] and [[Billy Mayerl]].",

      "wikitext_description": "A '''novelty song''' is a type of song built upon some form of novel concept, such as a [[gimmick]], a piece of [[Comedy music|humor]], or a sample of popular culture. Novelty songs partially overlap with [[Comedy music|comedy songs]], which are more explicitly based on humor, and with [[musical parody]], especially when the novel gimmick is another popular song. Novelty songs achieved great popularity during the 1920s and 1930s. They had a resurgence of interest in the 1950s and 1960s. The term arose in [[Tin Pan Alley]] to describe one of the major divisions of [[popular music]]; the other two divisions were [[Ballad (music)|ballads]] and [[dance music]]. Humorous songs, or those containing humorous elements, are not necessarily novelty songs.\n\nNovelty songs are often a [[Parody song|parody]] or humor song, and may apply to a current event such as a holiday or a fad such as a [[novelty and fad dances|dance]] or TV program. Many use unusual lyrics, subjects, sounds, or instrumentation, and may not even be musical.  For example, the 1966 novelty song \"[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]\", by [[Napoleon XIV]], has little music and is set to a rhythm tapped out on a [[snare drum]],  a [[tambourine]], and the bare sides of the musicians' legs.\n\nA book on achieving an attention-grabbing novelty single is ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]'', written by [[The KLF]]. It is based on their achievement of a UK number-one single with \"[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]\", a 1988 dance remix mashup of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Doctor Who theme music|theme music]] released under the name of 'The Timelords'. It argued that (at the time) achieving a number one single could be achieved less by musical talent than through [[market research]], [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and gimmicks matched to an underlying danceable groove.",

The style of the music relies on using various effects such as looping, effects pedals and synthesizers to distort the music. The shoegaze revival draws inspiration heavily from shoegaze but incorporates more modern synthesizers and drum tracks.",

Nu metal rarely features [[guitar solo]]s or other displays of [[musical technique]] and emphasizes rhythm with instrumentation that is heavily [[Syncopation|syncopated]]. Nu metal guitarists typically use [[seven-string guitar]]s that are [[guitar tunings|down-tuned]] to produce a heavier sound. Vocal styles are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop, and include [[singing]], [[rapping]], [[screaming (music)|screaming]] and sometimes [[death growl|growl]]ing. [[Turntablism|DJs]] are occasionally featured to provide instrumentation such as [[Sampling (music)|sampling]], turntable [[scratching]] and [[electronic musical instrument|electronic]] background music. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the [[new wave of American heavy metal]]. \n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like [[Pantera]], [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], and [[Faith No More]] were influential in the development of nu-metal with their [[groove metal]] and alternative metal styles. [[Korn]] is often credited as pioneering the subgenre in the mid-1990s with their [[Korn (album)|self-titled]] debut album. Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s, with bands and artists such as Korn, [[Limp Bizkit]], and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Its popularity continued through the early 2000s, with bands such as [[Papa Roach]], [[Staind]], and [[P.O.D.]] all selling multi-platinum albums. The popularity of nu metal came to a peak in 2001 with [[Linkin Park]]'s diamond-selling album ''[[Hybrid Theory]]''. By the mid-2000s, however, the oversaturation of bands combined with the underperformance of several high-profile releases led to the subgenre's decline, leading to the rise of [[metalcore]] and many nu-metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.\n\nThe 2010s brought a nu-metal revival; many bands that combined it with other genres (for example, [[metalcore]] and [[deathcore]]) emerged, and some nu-metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu-metal sound. Bands such as [[Of Mice & Men (band)|Of Mice & Men]], [[Emmure]], [[Issues (band)|Issues]], [[My Ticket Home]], and [[Bring Me the Horizon]] combined nu metal with metalcore or deathcore. Artists like [[Grimes]], [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]], and [[Rina Sawayama]] integrated nu-metal sounds into [[Electropop|electronic pop music]] in the late 2010s and early 2020s, and interest in nu metal rose in the early 2020s.",

It is mainly used to uplift spirits and entertain guests at events, while extolling the virtues of illustrious men and women, and telling stories that edify.\n\nIt is the traditional music played acoustically in live or recorded form at festive events, such as the [[Ekpe/Okonko]] (masquerade festival), [[Iwa akwa]] (manhood rite of passage), Ichi Echichi (coronation and titling ceremonies), Iza Aha (age-grade maturity ceremony), Ikeji/Iriji (new yam festival), Igbankwu Nwanyi (bridal wine-carrying dance at marriage ceremonies), Igboto Mma (retirement celebration for elderly men), Olili (burial celebration of life), etc.\n\nIt is sung by mainly men with syncopating rhythms of chants and harmonized choruses, incorporating traditional Igbo percussions, such as the ekwe/ekere, ikoro, [[udu]], ekpete/igba (congas), ogele (big gongs), oyo, etc. The blending of wise sayings, parables, mystifying hums, and the melodic drumming gives it a captivating feel that leaves the listener dancing in pace with its beats.\n\nOdumodu is usually sung in the call-response style, which features vocals from a lead singer who elicits the response and backing of a group of vocalists, who are often the instrumentalists. Some famous Odumodu artists include [[Mary Kanu]] of [[Arochukwu|Atani Arochukwu]], Prof [[Obewe]] and King [[Ogenwanne]] of [[Ohuhu]], Umuahia, Brother Ezeugo of Ogbodi, Umuahia, Ichie Nwamuruamu of Ibeku, Umuahia, and many more.\n\n{{Igbo topics}}",

The lyrics were usually not a very important part of old-school rap songs, but always included shoutouts to the artist's native New York City borough. Rap also emphasized the fashion of the time, whether it be Adidas, Kangol, Lee jeans, or the popular \"Sheep dog\" coats. However, there were some songs, such as Brother D's \"[[How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?]]\" and Kurtis Blow's \"Hard Times\" (both released in 1980), that explored socially relevant ideas. The release of \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" in 1982, written by [[Duke Bootee]] and [[Melle Mel]] and credited to [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five]], marked the arrival of [[Political hip-hop|hip hop as social commentary]], making it possible for future artists like [[Public Enemy]] and [[N.W.A]] to create an identity based on socially conscious themes in later years.

Paranda mainly focuses on the struggles that occurs in the [[Garifuna]] community and emphasizes melodies that contain soulful [[lament]]ations.

The style has spread to places where the Garifuna migrated, but the highest concentration of population and use of the music/dance style persists in [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]] and Honduras. The Latin-American influence of paranda is seen in its use of serenade and solemn social commentary accompanied by acoustic guitar. Usually performed by men, the music has a moderate [[tempo]] and is characterized by distinctive drum rhythms. The pattern begins with a [[quarter note]] and [[eighth note]] tapped in the [[Drum hardware|drum center]] followed by an eighth note tapped on the drum rim. It is related to the [[parranda]]s of [[Venezuela]] and [[Puerto Rico]],{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} as well as the [[Parang music|parang]] from [[Trinidad and Tobago]], but unlike its counterparts is not derived from religious themes.

It arose in [[Beijing]] in the mid-[[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. The form was extremely popular in the Qing court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China. Major performance troupes are based in Beijing, [[Tianjin]] and [[Shanghai]]. The art form is also preserved in [[Taiwan]], where it is also known as {{lang|zh-Latn|Guójù}} ({{zh|t=國劇 |l=National opera}}). It has also spread to other regions such as the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].\n\nPeking opera features four main role types, ''[[Sheng role|sheng]]'' (gentlemen), ''[[dan role|dan]]'' (women), ''[[jing role|jing]]'' (rough men), and ''[[chou role|chou]]'' (clowns). Performing troupes often have several of each variety, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the {{lang|zh-Latn|xīpí}} ({{lang|zh|西皮}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|èrhuáng}} ({{lang|zh-hans|二黄}}) styles. Melodies include [[aria]]s, fixed-tune melodies and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on [[Chinese history]], [[Chinese folklore|folklore]] and, increasingly, contemporary life.\n\nTraditional Peking opera was denounced as \"feudalistic\" and \"bourgeois\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976) and replaced mostly with the [[revolutionary opera]]s until the period's end. After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. In recent years, Peking opera has responded to sagging audience numbers by attempting reforms, including improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements, shortening works, and performing new and original plays.",

The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by composer [[John Oswald (composer)|John Oswald]] in 1985 in his essay \"Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative\", and eventually explicitly defined in the liner notes of his ''[[Grayfolded]]'' album. Plunderphonics is a form of [[sound collage]]. Oswald has described it as a referential and self-conscious practice which interrogates notions of [[originality]] and [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].\n\nAlthough the concept of plunderphonics is broad, in practice there are many common themes used in what is normally called plunderphonic music. This includes heavy [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of [[educational film]]s of the 1950s, [[news]] reports, [[Radio programming|radio shows]], or anything with trained vocal [[announcer]]s. Oswald's contributions to this genre rarely used these materials, the exception being his [[Rapping|rap]]-like 1975 track \"Power\", which combined a [[Led Zeppelin]] instrumental with a sermon of a Southern US evangelist.\n\nThe process of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] other sources is found in various [[genre]]s (notably [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and especially [[turntablism]]), but in plunderphonic works, the sampled material is often the only sound used. These samples are usually uncleared and sometimes result in legal action being taken due to [[copyright]] infringement. Some plunderphonic [[artist]]s use their work to protest what they consider to be overly restrictive copyright laws. Many plunderphonic artists claim their use of other artists' materials falls under the [[fair use]] doctrine.\n\nDevelopment of the process is when creative musicians plunder an original track and overlay new material and sounds on top until the original piece is masked and then removed, though often using scales and beats. It is a studio-based technique used by such groups as the American experimental band [[the Residents]] (who used Beatles tracks), and other noted exponents including [[DJ Shadow]], [[808 State]] and [[the Avalanches]].",

It typically addresses [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] issues through lyrics, aiming to inspire action, promote social change, or convey specific political viewpoints. The genre draws inspiration from earlier politically conscious artists, such as [[The Last Poets]] and [[Gil Scott-Heron]], as well as movements like the [[Black power movement|Black Power]] movement and the [[Black Panther Party]] from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nNotable early political hip hop artists include [[KRS-One]] and [[Boogie Down Productions]], as well as [[Public Enemy]], both of whom were influential in establishing political rap in the late 1980s with albums that addressed social and political concerns. Other artists, often labeled as part of the \"conscious rap\" movement, such as [[X Clan|X-Clan]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]], [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]], and [[The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy|Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy]], followed in subsequent years, expanding the genre's focus on political messages.\n\nThe genre has long been intertwined with political activism, providing a platform for artists to address issues such as [[police brutality]], [[racism]], [[corruption]], and [[economic inequality]]. Some well-known examples of politically charged hip hop songs include: \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" (1982), \"[[Fight the Power (Public Enemy song)|Fight the Power]]\" (1989), \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" (1989), \"[[Changes (Tupac Shakur song)|Changes]]\" (1998), \"[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]\" (2004), \"[[Kingdom Come (Jay-Z album)|Minority Report]]\" (2006), \"[[The Blacker the Berry (song)|The Blacker the Berry]]\" (2015), \"[[Snow on tha Bluff (song)|Snow on Tha Bluff]]\" (2020), and \"[[The Bigger Picture (song)|The Bigger Picture]]\" (2020).",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Pop-punk''' (also '''punk-pop''', alternatively spelled without the hyphen) is a [[rock music]] [[fusion genre]] that combines elements of [[punk rock]] with [[power pop]] or [[pop music|pop]]. It is defined by its fast-paced, energetic tempos, and emphasis on classic pop songcraft, as well as [[Adolescence|adolescent]] and anti-[[suburb]]ia themes. It is distinguished from other punk-variant genres by drawing more heavily from 1960s bands such as [[the Beatles]], [[the Kinks]], and [[the Beach Boys]]. The genre has evolved throughout its history, absorbing elements from [[new wave music|new wave]], [[college rock]], [[ska]], [[Hip-hop|hip hop]], [[emo]], [[boy band]] pop and even [[hardcore punk]] and [[metalcore]]. It is sometimes considered interchangeable with power pop and [[skate punk]].\n\nPop-punk emerged in the late 1970s with groups such as the [[Ramones]], [[the Undertones]], and the [[Buzzcocks]] setting the genre's groundwork. 1980s punk bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Descendents]] and [[the Misfits (band)|the Misfits]], while not necessarily pop-punk in and of themselves, were influential to pop-punk, and it expanded in the late 1980s and early 1990s by a host of bands signed to [[Lookout Records|Lookout! Records]], including [[Screeching Weasel]], [[the Queers]], and [[the Mr. T Experience]]. In the mid-1990s, the genre saw a widespread popularity increase and entered the mainstream with bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]]. The genre experienced another wave popularized during the late 1990s and early 2000s led by [[Blink-182]], and in their wake followed contemporary acts such as [[Sum 41]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Good Charlotte]], and [[Avril Lavigne]], while the [[Warped Tour]] played a crucial role in launching up-and-coming pop-punk artists.\n\nPop-punk's mainstream popularity continued in the mid-to-late 2000s, with artists such as [[Fall Out Boy]], [[My Chemical Romance]], and [[Paramore]] achieving high levels of commercial success. By this point, pop-punk acts were largely indistinguishable from artists tagged as \"emo\", to the extent that emo crossover acts such as Fall Out Boy and Paramore popularized a pop-punk-influenced style dubbed [[emo pop]]. By the 2010s, pop-punk's mainstream popularity had waned, with rock bands and guitar-centric music becoming rare on dance-focused pop radio. During this period, however, a wave of underground artists defined a rawer and more emotional take on the genre, namely [[The Story So Far (band)|the Story so Far]], [[the Wonder Years (band)|the Wonder Years]] and [[Neck Deep]]. In the early 2020s, a new crop of pop-punk music began experiencing mainstream resurgence with various new acts such as [[Machine Gun Kelly (musician)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[KennyHoopla]] and [[Yungblud]].",

Post-punk musicians departed from punk's fundamental elements and raw simplicity, instead adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a variety of [[avant-garde]] sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and [[do it yourself ethic]] but determined to break from rock [[cliche]]s, artists experimented with styles like [[funk]], [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], and [[dance music]]; the [[music production|production techniques]] of [[dub music|dub]] and [[disco]]; and ideas from art and politics, including [[critical theory]], [[modernist art]], [[Film|cinema]] and [[modernist literature|literature]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=xxxi}} These communities produced [[independent record labels]], visual art, [[multimedia]] performances and [[fanzines]].\n\nThe early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups including [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Public Image Ltd]], [[the Pop Group]], [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]], [[Joy Division]], [[Talking Heads]], [[the Raincoats]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[the Cure]], and [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]. The movement was closely related to the development of ancillary genres such as [[gothic rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[no wave]], and [[industrial music]]. By the mid-1980s, post-punk had dissipated, but it provided a foundation for the [[new pop]] movement and the later [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[indie rock|independent]] genres.",

Post-rock artists often combine rock instrumentation and rock stylings with [[Electronic musical instrument|electronics]] and digital production as a means of enabling the exploration of textures, timbres and different styles.

The genre began in [[Indie music scene|indie]] and [[underground music]] scenes, but deviated.\n\nThe term ''post-rock'' was coined by music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], being popularized in a review of [[Bark Psychosis]]' 1994 album ''[[Hex (Bark Psychosis album)|Hex]]'', and he later expanded the concept as music \"using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes\". The term has since developed to refer to bands oriented around dramatic and suspense-driven [[instrumental rock]], making the term controversial among listeners and artists alike.\n\nGroups such as [[Talk Talk]] and [[Slint]] were credited with producing foundational works in the style in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With the release of [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]]'s 1996 album ''[[Millions Now Living Will Never Die]]'', post-rock became an accepted term for the associated scene of artists. Over time, post-rock diversified, spawning fusion subgenres like [[post-metal]] and [[blackgaze]], and influencing indie rock, [[electronica]], and forms of metal.",

It typically incorporates melodic [[hook (music)|hooks]], vocal harmonies, an energetic performance, and cheerful-sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning, longing, despair, or self-empowerment. The sound is primarily rooted in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] traditions of the early-to-mid 1960s, although some artists have occasionally drawn from later styles such as [[punk rock|punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[glam rock]], [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]], [[college rock]], and [[neo-psychedelia]]. \n\nOriginating in the 1960s, power pop developed mainly among American musicians who [[came of age]] during the [[British Invasion]]. Many of these young musicians wished to retain the \"teenage innocence\" of pop and rebelled against newer forms of rock music that were thought to be pretentious and inaccessible. The term was coined in 1967 by the Who guitarist and songwriter [[Pete Townshend]] to describe his band's style of music. However, power pop became more widely identified with later acts of the 1970s who sought to revive [[Beatlesque|Beatles-style pop]].\n\nEarly 1970s releases by [[Badfinger]], the [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], and [[Todd Rundgren]] are sometimes credited with solidifying the power pop sound into a recognizable genre. Power pop reached its commercial peak during the rise of punk and new wave in the late 1970s, with [[Cheap Trick]], [[the Knack]], [[the Romantics]], [[Nick Lowe]], [[Dave Edmunds]], and [[Dwight Twilley]] among those enjoying the most success. After a popular and critical backlash to the genre's biggest hit, \"[[My Sharona]]\" (the Knack, 1979), record companies generally stopped signing power pop groups, and most of the 1970s bands broke up in the early 1980s.\n\nOver subsequent decades, power pop continued with modest commercial success while also remaining a frequent object of derision among some critics and musicians. The 1990s saw a new wave of [[alternative rock|alternative]] bands that were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they had influenced. Although not as successful as their predecessors, [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]], [[the Posies]], [[Redd Kross]], [[Teenage Fanclub]], and [[Material Issue]] were critical and cult favorites. In the mid-1990s, an offshoot genre that combined power pop-style harmonies with uptempo punk rock, dubbed \"[[pop-punk]]\", reached mainstream popularity.",

Initially termed \"[[progressive pop]]\", the style emerged from [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] bands who abandoned standard [[pop music|pop]] or [[Rock_Music|rock]] traditions in favour of [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumental]] and [[Composition (music)|compositional]] techniques more commonly associated with [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], or [[classical music]], while retaining the instrumentation typical of [[rock music]]. Additional elements contributed to its \"[[progressive music|progressive]]\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \"[[art music|art]]\", and the studio, rather than the stage, [[Recording studio as an instrument|became the focus of musical activity]], which often involved creating music for listening rather than dancing.\n\nProgressive rock includes a fusion of styles, approaches and genres, and tends to be diverse and [[eclecticism in music|eclectic]]. Progressive rock is often associated with long solos, extended pieces, fantastic lyrics, grandiose stage sets and costumes, and an obsessive dedication to technical skill. While the genre is often cited for its merging of [[high culture]] and [[low culture]], few artists incorporated classical themes in their work to a significant degree, and only a handful of groups, such as [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] and [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]], intentionally emulated or referenced classical music.\n\nThe genre arose during the mid-1960s. In the early-to-mid-1970s, progressive rock groups such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] experienced great worldwide success; in the late 1970s, progressive rock experienced declining popularity, from which it has never fully recovered.{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=1}} Music critics, who often labelled the style of progressive rock as \"pretentious\" and the sounds as \"pompous\" and \"overblown\", tended to be hostile towards the genre or to completely ignore it.{{sfn|Lucky|2000|p=7}} After the late 1970s, progressive rock fragmented into numerous forms. Some bands achieved commercial success well into the 1980s (albeit with changed lineups and more compact song structures) or crossed into [[symphonic pop]], [[arena rock]], or [[new wave music|new wave]].\n\nEarly groups who exhibited progressive features are retroactively described as \"[[proto-prog]]\". The [[Canterbury scene]], originating in the late 1960s, denotes a subset of progressive rock bands who emphasised the use of [[wind instrument]]s, complex chord changes and long improvisations. [[Rock in Opposition]], from the late 1970s, was more [[avant-garde]], and when combined with the Canterbury style, created [[avant-prog]]. In the 1980s, a new subgenre, [[neo-prog]], enjoyed some commercial success, although it was also accused of being derivative and lacking in innovation. [[Post-progressive]] draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid-1970s.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Proibidão''' ({{IPA|pt|pɾo.ibiˈdɐ̃w̃|lang}}), which literally translates to \"strongly prohibited\" or \"heavily forbidden\", is a subgenre of [[funk carioca]] music originating from the [[favela]]s of [[Rio de Janeiro]] where it began in the early 1990s as a parallel phenomenon to the growth of drug gangs in the many slums of the city. The drug gangs sponsored DJs and [[baile funk]]s in the favelas they controlled to spread respect and love for their gang as well as hate to the other gangs. The music that resulted is proibidão.\n\nProibidão is characterized as a raw mix of live funk vocals and [[Miami bass]] structures.  The explicit lyrics typically promote the gang the MC is affiliated with, crime, drug use, and violence. Each drug gang sponsors their own baile funk at their own favela(s), which results in a unique sound that distinguishes each MC, and by extension, each gang.\n\nThe highly territorial nature of the gangs has made proibidão an extremely localized form of funk in Rio de Janeiro.  Moreover, in Brazil, it is against the law to promote crime in song lyrics which makes most proibidão songs illegal to perform or broadcast through radio (hence the name \"proibidão\"). These two factors seldom allow proibidão to be heard beyond the live performances in favela.\n\nOne particularly powerful gang, the [[Comando Vermelho]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Red Command'') has given poor youths free girls, drinks, and entertainment at their dances, hoping to engrain a positive image of drug-dealing and gang membership to Rio youths. In Red Command released CDs, their gang sign, a CV, sits across the label, representing the community and the gang instead of the artists. The Red Command's influence was best shown in 1990, when William Santos de Souza and Duda, the \"Kings of Rio rap\" at the time, released a track entitled, \"Rap do Borel\" shouting out to a gang-controlled favela in Rio. No gang better represents Proibidão than the Commando Vermelho.\n\nOther gangs also have renowned songs. For example, the gang [[Amigos dos Amigos]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ‘’Friends of Friends’’) is known for \"A.D.A do Chuck\", featuring MC Cruel. Another Funk emcee, MC Colibri, was very successful with erotic funk, but he has also already made music for the [[Terceiro Comando Puro]].\n\nProibidão has some very important implications for the acquisition of social space in Rio. For the gangs and drug lords, it represents a form of musical expression that corresponds to territorial dominance. In effect, when these gangs host their particular bailes, they assert their authority over rival gangs and state law enforcement. Since Proibidão elicits the criminal lifestyle and habitual drug use which characterize its performers, police naturally attempt to stop the bailes and the correlative spread of Proibidão. Thus, when myriad bailes do subsist each week, despite the efforts of state programs like D.R.E (Divisão de Repressão à Entorpecentes or [[Division of the Repression Against Drugs]])  to stop them, it is a palpable win for the gangs. In addition to just hosting these bailes, the gangs recruit urban youth and advertise their daily struggle, which makes the favela bailes a crucial social space in which gangs can conduct business.",

Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often applied spuriously.{{sfn|Hicks|2000|p=63}}\n\nOriginating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sound of psychedelic rock invokes three core effects of LSD: [[depersonalization]], dechronicization (the bending of time), and dynamization (when fixed, ordinary objects dissolve into moving, dancing structures), all of which detach the user from everyday reality.{{sfn|Hicks|2000|p=63}} Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty studio tricks, [[electronic music|electronic]] or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and extended instrumental segments.{{sfn|Hicks|2000|pp=63–66}} Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were based in [[contemporary folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], and the [[blues]], while others showcased an explicit [[Indian classical]] influence called \"[[raga rock]]\". In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast \"[[acid rock]]\". While \"acid rock\" is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term \"psychedelic rock\", it also refers more specifically to the heavier, harder, and more extreme ends of the genre.\n\nThe peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 [[Summer of Love]] and the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], becoming an international musical movement associated with a widespread [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] before declining as changing attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to [[progressive rock]] and [[hard rock]], and as a result contributed to the development of sub-genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of [[neo-psychedelia]].\n\n{{toclimit|4}}",

It is often played with an upright [[double bass]], instead of the [[bass guitar|electric bass]] which is more common in modern rock music, and the [[hollowbody electric guitar]], rather than the solid-bodied electric guitars that predominate in rock.

The music gained popularity in [[Europe]] in the early 1980s, with the UK band [[The Meteors]], but remained underground in the United States until the late 1990s. The second wave of psychobilly began with the 1986 release of British band [[Demented Are Go]]'s debut album ''[[In Sickness & In Health]]''. The genre soon spread throughout [[Europe]], inspiring a number of new acts such as [[Mad Sin]] (formed in Germany in 1987) and the [[Nekromantix]] (formed in [[Denmark]] in 1989), who released the album ''[[Curse of the Coffin]]'' in 1991. Since then the advent of several notable psychobilly bands, such as the U.S. band [[Tiger Army]] and the Australian band [[The Living End]], has led to its mainstream popularity and attracted international attention to the genre.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Punk rock''' (also known as simply '''punk''') is a [[rock music]] genre that emerged in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s [[rock and roll]] and 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the corporate nature of mainstream 1970s rock music. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles with stripped-down instrumentation. Punk rock lyrics often explore [[anti-establishment]] and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] themes. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label|independent label]]s.\n\nThe term \"punk rock\" was previously used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe the mid-1960s garage bands. Certain late 1960s and early 1970s Detroit acts, such as [[MC5]] and [[Iggy and the Stooges]], and other bands from elsewhere created out-of-the-mainstream music that became highly influential on what was to come. [[Glam rock]] in the UK and [[the New York Dolls]] from New York have also been cited as key influences. Between 1974 and 1976, when the genre that became known as punk was developing, prominent acts included [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in [[Brisbane punk rock|Brisbane]]; the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London, and the [[Buzzcocks]] in Manchester. By late 1976, punk had become a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It gave rise to a [[punk subculture]] that expressed youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing]], such as T-shirts with deliberately offensive graphics, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes.\n\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture spread worldwide. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the mainstream. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave, when new acts that had not been active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres, such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g., [[Minor Threat]]), [[Oi!]] (e.g., [[Sham 69]]), [[street punk]] (e.g., [[the Exploited]]), and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g., [[Crass]]), became some of the predominant modes of punk rock, while bands more similar in form to the first wave (e.g., [[X (American band)|X]], [[the Adicts]]) also flourished. Many musicians who identified with punk or were inspired by it went on to pursue other musical directions, giving rise to movements such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[thrash metal]], and [[alternative rock]]. Following alternative rock's mainstream breakthrough in the 1990s with [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], punk rock saw renewed major-label interest and mainstream appeal exemplified by the rise of the California bands [[Green Day]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], [[Bad Religion]], and [[NOFX]].\n\nThe anti-government stance and nihilistic impression of the future provided by capitalism united the punk scene in the 1970s in the United Kingdom as other bands emerged in the 70s and 80s like X-Ray Spex and Steel Pulse.",

It heavily incorporates [[West Africa]]n/[[Central Africa]]n drumming, the dance primarily of [[Angola]] and [[Congo]] origins. The music also includes Indigenous Kalingo and Spanish influences. In addition to [[Honduras]], Garifuna populations can be found in Guatemala (approximately 15,000 people), Belize (around 35,000 people), and Nicaragua (about 10,000 people). It is widely recognized as the national dance of Honduras, symbolizing resilience, identity, and pride. Punta has its origins on the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent and Honduras after its arrival to the Honduran department of Roatán in 1797, over 228 years ago where it developed blending Garifuna drums with piano, guitar and congas. Punta is a vibrant representation of the community's heritage. It is also referred to as Banguity or Bunda.\n\nThe Garífuna people trace their ancestry back to [[West Africa|West Africans]] who escaped slavery and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Punta is used to reaffirm and express the struggle felt by the population's common heritage through cultural artforms such as dance and music; to highlight their strong sense of endurance; and reconnect to their ancestors. Besides [[Honduras]], punta can also be found in the following:  [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the [[United States]].\n\nLyrics may be in Garifuna, [[Belizean Kriol language|Kriol]], [[English language|English]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Most songs are performed in Garifuna or Spanish, and are often contemporary adaptations of traditional Garífuna songs. Being the most popular dance in Honduran culture, Punta is danced specifically at funerals, on beaches, and in parks. Punta is iconic of Garífuna legacy and modernity and can be seen as poetic folk art that connects older cultures and rhythms with new sounds. Chumba and hunguhungu, circular dances in triple rhythm, are often combined with punta.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''''Radif''''' ({{langx|fa|ردیف}}, {{lit|order}}) is a collection of many old [[Melody type|melodic figures]] preserved through many generations by oral tradition. It organizes the [[melody|melodies]] in a number of different [[Tonality|tonal]] spaces called ''[[dastgāh]]''. The [[Persian traditional music|traditional music]] of [[Iran]] is based on the ''[[radif]]'', which is a collection of old melodies that have been handed down by the masters to the students through the generations. Over time, each master's own interpretation has shaped and added new melodies to this collection, which may bear the master's name.\n\nThe preservation of these melodies greatly depended on each successive generation's memory and mastery, since the interpretive origin of this music was expressed only through the oral tradition.\n\nTo learn and absorb the essence of the ''radif'', many years of repetition and practice are required. A master of the ''radif'' must internalize it so completely to be able to perform any part of it at any given time.\n\nThe ''radif'' contains several different ''dastgāhs'' which are distinguished from each other by their relationship of [[Interval (music)|note intervals]] and the form of the movement of the melodies within them. A ''dastgāh'' portrays a specific sonic space. A ''dastgāh'' may contain approximately 10 to 30 {{lang|far|[[gousheh]]s}} (\"melodies\"). The principal {{lang|far|goushehs}} of the ''dastgāh'' specify the different [[Scale (music)|scales]] within that ''dastgāh''. The [[Musical note|note]], upon which the {{lang|far|gousheh}} is based and often is the center of the {{lang|far|gousheh}}, is called the ''shahed''. The ''shahed'' moves when we modulate between principal {{lang|far|goushehs}}, and this movement creates a new sonic space. [[Rhythm]] in these melodies takes three different forms: symmetric, asymmetric (lang), and free form. The rhythm is greatly influenced by the rhythm and meter of [[Iran|Persian]] poetry. The instrumental and vocal ''radif'' is different from the rhythmical point of view; however, their melodic structures are the same.\n\nThe ''radifs'' for [[tar (string instrument)|tar]] are one of the most famous ''radifs'' associated, with many old melodies collected that include 20–40 {{lang|far|goushehs}} in each ''dastgāh''.\n\nThe ''radifs'' of [[Mirza Hossein-Qoli]] and [[Mirza Abdollah]] are the oldest ''radifs'' that are still in use for many students who wish to carry on learning [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]]. It is very famous as it consisted of many melodies collected from that time and before.\n\nMany of the melodies were changed by Mirza Gholi and some kept same to the composer's desire, but the evidence is small to suggest melodies were changed or not, but due to ''radif'' being passed down through [[oral tradition]] (not in notation) we cannot state whether melodies were changed as we cannot compare notations or audios, but due to the mutations in music through oral transfer it is obvious.\n\nOne of the most notable [[Tar (string instrument)|tar]] players and repertoire of Mirza Hossien Gholi's ''radif'' was Ostad [[Ali-Akbar Shahnazi]], who was the son of Mirza Hossien Gholi and was the first tar player to record the long ''radif'' memorized by heart. His work is still used by many Masters and are now some directions which are followed by many tar players. Of course, beginner-intermediate students will not be able to follow his works on audio due to the level at which it was performed at, so not much will be understood, but a Tar Master can expect to use it and re-focus on what was forgotten in his teachings at lesson with students. This can minimize mutations and keep the ''radif'' in line.\n\nThe ''radif'' of [[Mirza Abdollah]] was published in notation by [[Jean During]] in 1970s based on Nour Ali Boroumand, who recorded the ''radif'' by heart. On the other hand, the ''radif'' of [[Mirza Hossein-Qoli]] was first published in [[Musical notation|notation]] by [[Dariush Pirniakan]] in 2001. Though the ''radif'' is not popular with many young students it still is the constitute and basis of Persian music. It can be related to Classical music of western music that is not much popular, but forms the basis of Western Music.",

Ragtime was popularized during the early 20th century by composers such as [[Scott Joplin]], [[James Scott (composer)|James Scott]], and [[Joseph Lamb (composer)|Joseph Lamb]]. Ragtime pieces (often called \"rags\") are typically composed for and performed on [[piano]], though the genre has been adapted for a variety of instruments and styles.\n\nRagtime music originated within [[African Americans|African American]] communities in the late 19th century and became a distinctly American form of popular music. It is closely related to [[American march music|marches]]. Ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, often arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Scott Joplin, known as the \"King of Ragtime\", gained fame through compositions like \"[[Maple Leaf Rag]]\" and \"[[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]\". Ragtime influenced early [[jazz]], Harlem [[Stride (music)|stride piano]], [[Piedmont blues]], and early 20th century European classical composers such as [[Erik Satie]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]]. Despite being overshadowed by jazz in the 1920s, ragtime has experienced several revivals, notably in the 1950s and 1970s (the latter renaissance due in large part to the use of \"The Entertainer\" in the film ''[[The Sting]]''). The music was distributed primarily through [[sheet music]] and [[piano roll]]s, with some compositions adapted for other instruments and ensembles.",

The term also denotes the modern popular [[music of Jamaica]] and its [[Jamaican diaspora|diaspora]]. A 1968 single by [[Toots and the Maytals]], \"[[Do the Reggay]]\", was the first popular song to use the word ''reggae'', effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. Reggae is rooted in traditional Jamaican Kumina, Pukkumina, Revival Zion, Nyabinghi, and burru drumming. Jamaican reggae music evolved out of the earlier genres [[mento]], [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]]. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.\n\nStylistically, reggae incorporates some of the musical elements of rhythm and blues, jazz, mento (a celebratory, rural folk form that served its largely rural audience as dance music and an alternative to the hymns and adapted chanteys of local church singing), [[Calypso music|calypso]], and also draws influence from traditional African folk rhythms. One of the most easily recognizable elements is offbeat rhythms; [[staccato]] chords played by a guitar or piano (or both) on the offbeats of the measure. The tempo of reggae is usually slower-paced than both ska and rocksteady. The concept of [[call and response (music)|call and response]] can be found throughout reggae music. The genre of reggae music is led by the [[drum]] and bass. Some key players in this sound are [[Jackie Jackson (bassist)|Jackie Jackson]] from Toots and the Maytals, [[Carlton Barrett]] from [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]], [[Lloyd Brevett]] from [[the Skatalites]], [[Paul Douglas (musician)|Paul Douglas]] from Toots and the Maytals, [[Lloyd Knibb]] from the Skatalites, [[Winston Grennan]], [[Sly Dunbar]], and Anthony \"Benbow\" Creary from [[the Upsetters]]. The [[bass guitar]] often plays the dominant role in reggae. The bass sound in reggae is thick and heavy, and [[equalization (audio)|equalized]] so the upper frequencies are removed and the lower frequencies emphasized. The [[guitar]] in reggae usually plays on the offbeat of the rhythm.  It is common for reggae to be sung in [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Jamaican English]], and [[Iyaric]] dialects. Reggae is noted for its tradition of social criticism and religion in its lyrics, although many reggae songs discuss lighter, more personal subjects, such as love and socializing.\n\nReggae is deeply linked to [[Rastafari]], an [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting [[pan-Africanism]]. After the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafari and spread its gospel throughout the world. Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of Rastafari. The musician becomes the messenger, and as Rastafari see it, \"the soldier and the musician are tools for change.\"\n\nReggae has spread to many countries around the world, often incorporating local instruments and fusing with other genres. [[Reggae en Español]] spread from the Spanish-speaking Central American country of Panama to the mainland South American country of [[Venezuela]] and later to the rest of South America. [[Caribbean music in the United Kingdom]], including reggae, has been popular since the late 1960s, and has evolved into several subgenres and fusions. Many reggae artists began their careers in the UK, and there have been a number of European artists and bands drawing their inspiration directly from Jamaica and the Caribbean community in Europe. Reggae in Africa was boosted by the visit of [[Bob Marley]] to Zimbabwe in 1980.",

Reggaestep typically has similar drum samples as those used in reggae; however, the timing of these drums corresponds with the typical syncopation of drums in [[dubstep]]. Other influence taken from reggae include harmonic accentuation of the offbeats, however off-beat rhythms can sometimes be layered on top of more traditional dubstep or [[ragga]] melodies. The tempo tends to be at 140 BPM which is typical to dubstep. The \"drops\" in reggaestep are very similar to those of dubstep, but often follow similar melody patterns to reggae.",

It has evolved from [[dancehall]], with elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Latin American music|Latin American]], and [[Caribbean music]]. Vocals include [[Toasting (Jamaican music)|toasting]]/[[rapping]] and [[singing]], typically in Spanish.\n\nReggaetón, today, is regarded as one of the most popular music genres worldwide;{{Citation needed|reason=please provide evidence of worldwide popularity outside of Latin America|date=August 2024}} it is the top music genre among the [[Caribbean Spanish|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]] nations and one of the primary modern genres within the Spanish-language music industry. Seemingly endless artists from the Caribbean have risen to fame ([[Puerto Rico]], [[Panama]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Cuba]], [[Colombia]]). [[Argentina]] has seen a modern surge in young artists inspired by the reggaetón style, fusing their music with Spanish rap verses, [[Latin trap|trapetón]] and R&B-style vocals (such as the \"Los Del Espacio\", including [[LIT killah]], [[Tiago PZK]], [[Duki (rapper)|Duki]], [[Emilia Mernes|Emilia]], and [[María Becerra]], as well as Argentine pop star [[Tini Stoessel|Tini]]).\n\nSeveral established, world-famous performers—notably Puerto Rican-American [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Shakira]] from Colombia—have embraced the style, recording numerous duets and collaborations with top ''reggaetoneros''. Several other emerging international artists are seeing success in the genre as well, including [[Catalans|Catalán]]-[[Castilian people|Spanish]] singer [[Bad Gyal]] (from [[Barcelona]]) and [[trilingual]] Brazilian star [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]] (from [[Rio de Janeiro]]). Mexican-American singer [[Becky G]] (from [[Los Angeles, California]]) has experienced huge success in recent years, as a [[Latino American]] artist in the reggaetón genre. In 2004, [[Daddy Yankee]] released his smash single “[[Gasolina]]”, regarded by many as the first globally-successful reggaetón song; Daddy Yankee is credited with bringing the style to western pop music listeners. By the 2010s, the genre had seen increased popularity across [[Latin America]], as well as modern acceptance within [[Pop music|mainstream Western music]]; during the 2010s, several new award categories (focusing on reggaetón and Latin music) were unveiled at various American music awards shows, notably the English-language [[American Music Awards]], [[Billboard Music Awards]], [[Grammy Awards]], and [[MTV Video Music Awards]].",

The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when \"rocking, [[jazz]] based music&nbsp;... [with a] heavy, insistent beat\" was starting to become more popular.\nIn the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for [[freedom]] and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations.\n\nThe term \"rhythm and blues\" has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to [[blues]] records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of [[rock and roll]], the term \"R&B\" became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated [[electric blues]], as well as [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]]. By the 1970s, the term \"rhythm and blues\" had changed once again and was used as a blanket term for soul and [[funk]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as \"[[contemporary R&B]]\". This contemporary form combines rhythm and blues with various elements of [[pop music|pop]], soul, funk, [[disco]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[electronic music]].",

It [[Origins of rock and roll|originated]] from African American music such as [[jazz]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[electric blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[jump blues]], as well as from [[country music]]. While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.\n\nAccording to the journalist [[Greg Kot]], \"rock and roll\" refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as [[rock music]], though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll\". For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\n\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the [[piano]] or [[saxophone]] was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the [[electric guitar]] in the mid-to-late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated [[backbeat]], almost always provided by a [[snare drum]]. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more [[electric guitar]]s (one [[lead guitar|lead]], one [[rhythm guitar|rhythm]]) and a [[double bass]] (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric [[bass guitar]]s (\"Fender bass\") and [[Drum kit|drum kits]] became popular in classic rock.\n\nRock and roll had a profound influence on contemporary American lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, and is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the [[civil rights movement]], because of its widespread appeal to both [[Black American]] and [[White American]] teenagers.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Rock music''' is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[popular music]] that originated in the [[United States]] as \"[[rock and roll]]\" in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of styles from the mid-1960s, primarily in the United States and [[United Kingdom]]. It has its roots in rock and roll, a style that drew from the black musical genres of [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]], as well as from [[country music]]. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as [[electric blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], and incorporated influences from [[jazz]] and other styles. Rock is typically centered on the [[electric guitar]], usually as part of a rock group with [[electric bass guitar]], [[drum kit|drums]], and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a [[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}} time signature]] and using a [[verse–chorus form]]; however, the genre has become extremely diverse. Like [[pop music]], lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the [[Western world]] from the 1950s up to the 2010s.\n\nRock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with [[the Beatles]] at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed [[album era]] in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s \"[[classic rock]]\" period, a few distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like [[blues rock]], [[folk rock]], [[country rock]], [[Southern rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[jazz rock]], which contributed to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], influenced by the countercultural [[psychedelia|psychedelic and hippie scene]]. New genres that emerged included [[progressive rock]], which extended artistic elements, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], which emphasized an aggressive thick sound, and [[glam rock]], which highlighted showmanship and visual style. In the second half of the 1970s, [[punk rock]] reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[post-punk]] and eventually [[alternative rock]].\n\nFrom the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of [[grunge]], [[Britpop]], and [[indie rock]]. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including [[pop-punk]], [[electronic rock]], [[rap rock]], and [[rap metal]]. Some movements were conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the [[garage rock]] and [[post-punk revival|post-punk]] revival in the 2000s. Since the 2010s, rock has lost its position as the pre-eminent popular music genre in world culture, but remains commercially successful. The increased influence of [[hip-hop]] and [[electronic dance music]] can be seen in rock music, notably in the [[techno-pop]] scene of the early 2010s and the pop-punk-hip-hop revival of the 2020s.\n\nRock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including [[mod (subculture)|mods]] and [[rocker (subculture)|rockers]] in the U.K., the [[hippie]] movement and the wider [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Western counterculture movement]] that spread out from [[San Francisco]] in the U.S. in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s [[punk culture]] spawned the [[goth subculture|goth]], punk, and [[emo]] subcultures. Inheriting the [[Folk music|folk]] tradition of the [[protest song]], rock music has been [[Rock music and politics|associated with political activism]], as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult [[conformity]]. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to accusations of [[selling out]].{{toclimit|3}}",

      "wikitext_description": "[[Rock music]] in Australia, also known as '''Oz rock''', '''Australian rock''', and '''Aussie rock''', has a rich history, rooted in an appreciation of various rock genres originating in the United States and Britain, and to a lesser extent, in continental Europe and Africa. Australian rock has also contributed to the development of some of these genres, as well as having its own unique [[Australiana]] sound with [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] and its [[Indigenous Australian music|Indigenous music]].\n\nFrom 1955 to 1975, three distinct \"waves\" of Australian rock occurred. The first wave was from 1955 to 1963 and was influenced by American and British styles with local variants provided by artists such as [[Johnny O'Keefe]], who had a hit with \"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Wild One]]\", which appeared in July 1958. Late in that stage, clean-cut acts, which featured on TV's ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' and toured as the \"Bandstand family\", were representing local music on the record charts. The second wave from 1964 to 1969 was directly influenced by [[The Beatles]] and their tour of the country in June 1964. Two major acts from that era are [[The Easybeats]] and [[Bee Gees]]. A weekly magazine, ''[[Go-Set]]'', which was published from 1966 to 1974, and aimed at teenagers and twenty-year-olds, quickly became the most influential and popular music-related publication of the period. The third wave from 1970 to 1975, with the advent of pub rock, was typified by early exponents, [[Billy Thorpe|Billy Thorpe & The Aztecs]], [[Blackfeather]], and [[Buffalo (band)|Buffalo]]. Internationally, [[AC/DC]] started as a pub rock group in November 1973 and became one of the most well-known Australian rock bands, with more than 71 million sales in the US alone by 2014. Beginning in that era was ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', which was a popular music TV program on national broadcaster [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], and ran from November 1974 until July 1987.\n\nAfter 1975, Australian rock began to diversify, including local contributors to [[Punk rock in Australia|punk]] and [[Australian indie rock|indie rock]] styles. By the 1980s [[baby boomer]] acts were prominent, which included [[John Farnham]], whose album, ''[[Whispering Jack]]'' (October 1986) peaked at [[Number-one albums of 1986 (Australia)|number one]] on the Australian charts for 25 weeks and was certified 24x [[List of music recording sales certifications#Albums|platinum]] indicating shipment of over 1.68 million copies—the highest by any Australian artist. Also in that decade and the next, Indigenous rock groups such as [[Yothu Yindi]] and [[Warumpi Band]] achieved wider recognition.",

As a genre, it blends the sound of [[Western music (North America)|Western musical styles]] such as [[country music|country]] with that of [[rhythm and blues]], leading to what is considered \"classic\" rock and roll. Some have also described it as a blend of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with rock and roll. The term \"rockabilly\" itself is a [[portmanteau]] of \"rock\" (from \"rock 'n' roll\") and \"[[hillbilly]]\", the latter a reference to the country music (often called \"[[Hillbilly#Music|hillbilly music]]\" in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style. Other important influences on rockabilly include [[western swing]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[jump blues]], and [[electric blues]].\n\nDefining features of the rockabilly sound included strong rhythms, [[boogie woogie]] piano riffs, vocal [[twang]]s, [[doo-wop]] acapella singing, and common use of the [[tape echo]]; and eventually came to incorporate different instruments and vocal harmonies. Initially popularized by artists such as [[Carl Perkins]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Johnny Burnette]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and others, the rockabilly style waned in the late 1950s; nonetheless, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, rockabilly enjoyed a revival. An interest in the genre endures even in the 21st century, often within musical [[subculture]]s. Rockabilly has spawned a variety of sub-styles and has influenced the development of other genres such as [[punk rock]].",

[[Portuguese language]] at least since the 19th century, the word \"samba\" was originally used to designate a \"popular dance\".{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=247}} Over time, its meaning has been extended to a \"[[Batuque (Brazil)|batuque]]-like circle dance\", a [[Samba (Brazilian dance)|dance style]], and also to a \"music genre\".{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=247}}{{sfn|Frugiuele|2015|p=105}} This process of establishing itself as a musical genre began in the 1910s{{sfn|Lopes|2019|p=112}} and it had its inaugural landmark in the song \"[[Pelo Telefone]]\", launched in 1917.{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|pp=219, 254}}{{sfn|Reijonen|2017|p=44}} Despite being identified by its creators, the public, and the Brazilian [[music industry]] as \"samba\", this pioneering style was much more connected from the rhythmic and instrumental point of view to [[Maxixe (dance)|maxixe]] than to samba itself.{{sfn|Lopes|2019|p=112}}{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=11}}{{sfn|Matos|2013|p=126}}{{sfn|Matos|2015|p=126}}\n\nSamba was modernly structured as a musical genre only in the late 1920s{{sfn|Lopes|2019|p=112}}{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=11}}{{sfn|Sandroni|2001|p=80}} from the neighborhood of [[Estácio, Rio de Janeiro|Estácio]] and soon extended to [[Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro|Oswaldo Cruz]] and other parts of Rio through its [[commuter rail]].{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|pp=138, 182}} Today synonymous with the rhythm of samba,{{sfn|Reijonen|2017|p=47}} this new samba brought innovations in rhythm, melody and also in thematic aspects.{{sfn|Paiva|2009|p=39}} Its rhythmic change based on a new percussive instrumental pattern resulted in a more drummed and syncopated style{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=276}} – as opposed to the inaugural \"samba–maxixe\"{{sfn|Paiva|2009|p=36}} – notably characterized by a faster tempo, longer notes and a characterized cadence far beyond the simple ones used till then.{{sfn|Franceschi|2010|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Marcondes|1977|pp=708–709}} Also the \"Estácio paradigm\" innovated in the formatting of samba as a song, with its musical organization in first and second parts in both melody and lyrics.{{sfn|Matos|2013|p=126}}{{sfn|Paranhos|2003|p=85}}{{sfn|Paiva|2009|p=87}} In this way, the sambistas of Estácio created, structured and redefined the urban Carioca samba as a genre in a modern and finished way.{{sfn|Matos|2013|p=126}} In this process of establishment as an urban and modern musical expression, the Carioca samba had the decisive role of samba schools, responsible for defining and legitimizing definitively the aesthetic bases of rhythm,{{sfn|Paiva|2009|p=38}} and [[radio broadcasting]], which greatly contributed to the diffusion and popularization of the genre and its song singers.{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=235}} Thus, samba has achieved major projection throughout Brazil and has become one of the main [[National symbol|symbols]] of Brazilian [[national identity]].{{refn|\"Many groups and individuals (Black, Romani, Bahians, Cariocas, intellectuals, politicians, folklorists, classical composers, French, millionaires, poets – and even an American ambassador) participated, with greater or lesser tenacity, in the 'fixation' of samba as a musical genre and its nationalization\".{{sfn|Vianna|1995|p=151}}|group=nb}}{{refn|\"... the transformation of samba into national music was not a sudden event, going from repression to praise in less than a decade, but the crowning of a secular tradition of contacts ... between various social groups in attempt to invent Brazilian identity and popular culture.\"{{sfn|Vianna|1995|p=34}}|group=nb}}{{sfn|Stockler|2011|p=6}}{{sfn|Iphan|2014|pp=10, 15}} Once criminalized and rejected for its Afro Brazilian origins, and definitely working-class music in its mythic origins, the genre has also received support from members of the upper classes and the country's cultural elite.{{sfn|Benzecry|2015|p=43}}{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=183}}\n\nAt the same time that it established itself as the genesis of samba,{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=11}} the \"Estácio paradigm\" paved the way for its fragmentation into new sub-genres and styles of composition and interpretation throughout the 20th century.{{sfn|Lopes|2019|p=112}}{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=279}} Mainly from the so-called \"golden age\" of Brazilian music,{{sfn|Mello|Severiano|1997|p=241}} samba received abundant categorizations, some of which denote solid and well-accepted derivative strands, such as [[bossa nova]], [[pagode]], [[partido alto]], samba de breque, [[samba-canção]], [[Samba-enredo|samba de enredo]] and samba de terreiro, while other nomenclatures were somewhat more imprecise, such as samba do barulho (literally \"noise samba\"), samba epistolar (\"epistolary samba\") ou samba fonético (\"phonetic samba\"){{sfn|Matos|2013|p=127}} – and some merely derogatory – such as sambalada,{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=269}} sambolero or sambão joia.{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=271}}\n\nThe modern samba that emerged at the beginning of the 20th century is predominantly in a {{music|time|2|4}} [[time signature]] varied{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=247}} with the conscious use of a sung chorus to a [[batucada]] rhythm, with various stanzas of declaratory verses.{{sfn|Marcondes|1977|p=684}}{{sfn|Mello|2000|p=215}} Its traditional instrumentation is composed of percussion instruments such as the [[pandeiro]], [[cuíca]], [[tamborim]], [[ganzá]] and [[surdo]]{{sfn|Lopes|Simas|2015|p=220}}{{sfn|Bolão|2009|pp=22–44}}{{sfn|Santos|2018|pp=107–109}} accompaniment – whose inspiration is [[choro]] – such as classical guitar and [[cavaquinho]].{{sfn|Tinhorão|1990|pp=296–297}}{{sfn|Carvalho|2006|pp=153–154}} In 2005 [[UNESCO]] declared Samba de Roda part of [[Intangible Cultural Heritage of

      "wikitext_description": "A '''sea shanty''', '''shanty''', '''chantey''', or '''chanty''' ({{IPAc-en|'|ʃ|ae|n|t|i:}}) is a genre of traditional [[Folk music|folk song]] that was once commonly sung as a [[work song]] to accompany rhythmical labor aboard large [[Merchant vessel|merchant]] [[Sailing ship|sailing vessels]]. The term ''shanty'' most accurately refers to a specific style of work song belonging to this historical [[Musical repertoire|repertoire]]. However, in recent, popular usage, the scope of its definition is sometimes expanded to admit a wider range of repertoire and characteristics, or to refer to a \"maritime work song\" in general.\n\nFrom Latin ''cantare'' via French ''chanter'', the word ''shanty'' emerged in the mid-19th century in reference to an appreciably distinct genre of work song, developed especially on merchant vessels, that had come to prominence in the decades prior to the [[American Civil War]]. Shanty songs functioned to synchronize and thereby optimize labor, in what had then become larger vessels having smaller crews and operating on stricter schedules. The practice of singing shanties eventually became ubiquitous internationally and throughout the era of wind-driven [[Packet ship|packet]] and [[clipper ship]]s.\n\nShanties had antecedents in the working chants of British and other national maritime traditions, such as those sung while manually loading vessels with cotton in ports of the [[southern United States]]. Shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors, including [[Minstrel show|minstrel music]], popular [[March (music)|marches]], and land-based [[Folk music|folk songs]], which were then adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship. Such tasks, which usually required a coordinated group effort in either a pulling or pushing action, included weighing [[anchor]] and setting [[sail]].\n\nThe shanty genre was typified by flexible lyrical forms, which in practice provided for much [[improvisation]] and the ability to lengthen or shorten a song to match the circumstances. Its hallmark was [[Call and response (music)|call and response]], performed between a [[Solo (music)|soloist]] and the rest of the workers in chorus. The leader, called the ''shantyman'', was appreciated for his piquant language, lyrical wit, and strong voice. Shanties were sung without instrumental [[accompaniment]] and, historically speaking, they were only sung in work-based rather than entertainment-oriented contexts. Although most prominent in English, shanties have been created in or translated into other European languages.\n\nThe switch to [[Steamboat|steam-powered ships]] and the use of machines for shipboard tasks by the end of the 19th century meant that shanties gradually ceased to serve a practical function. Their use as work songs became negligible in the first half of the 20th century. Information about shanties was preserved by veteran [[sailors]] and [[folklorist]] song-collectors, and their written and [[Audio recording|audio-recorded]] work provided resources that would later support a revival in singing shanties as a land-based leisure activity. Commercial musical recordings, popular literature, and other media, especially since the 1920s, have inspired interest in shanties among {{linktext|landlubber}}s. Contemporary performances of these songs range from the \"traditional\" style of maritime music to various modern music genres.",

      "wikitext_description": "[[Simon Frith]], the British sociomusicologist and former rock critic, identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of [[Soul music|soul]] artists, particularly [[Ray Charles]], and the adaptation of this style by performers such as [[Eric Burdon]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and [[Joe Cocker]] to produce slow-tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars, and sometimes choirs. According to [[Charles Aaron]], power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences while retaining their \"macho rocker\" mystique. The [[hard rock]] power ballad typically expresses love or heartache through its lyrics, shifting into wordless intensity and emotional transcendence with heavy drumming and a distorted [[electric guitar]] solo representing the \"power\" in the power ballad.\n\nAaron argues that the hard rock power ballad broke into the mainstream of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier impassioned songs such as [[Badfinger]]'s \"[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]\", [[Led Zeppelin]]'s \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" and [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[Dream On (Aerosmith song)|Dream On]]\". [[The Carpenters]]' 1972 single \"[[Goodbye to Love]]\" has also been identified as a prototype of the power ballad, driven by the hard rock guitar sound of [[Tony Peluso]]. British [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] wrote many power ballads, starting with \"[[Dreamer Deceiver]]\" and \"[[Beyond the Realms of Death]]\".\n\nAmerican rock band [[Styx (band)|Styx]] has been credited with releasing the first true power ballad, the song \"[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]\", in 1973. Its writer, [[Dennis DeYoung]] is called the \"father of the power ballad\". In the 1980s, bands such as [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and [[REO Speedwagon]] contributed to the power ballad becoming a staple of hard rock performers who wanted to gain more radio airplay and satisfy their female audience members with a slower, more emotional love song.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} [[Mötley Crüe]] was one of the bands showcasing this style, with songs such as \"[[Home Sweet Home (Mötley Crüe song)|Home Sweet Home]]\" and \"[[You're All I Need (song)|You're All I Need]]\". Nearly every hard rock and [[glam metal]] band wrote at least one power ballad for each album, and record labels often released these as the album's second single.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}\n\nWhen [[grunge]] appeared as a counterpoint to the excesses of 1980s hard rock and glam metal, one of the distinctions of the grunge style was the absence of power ballads; however, some songs from this era such as \"Rooster\" by Alice in Chains (1992), which Ned Raggett described as the band's \"own particular approach\" to the style, and \"[[Black Hole Sun]]\" by Soundgarden (1994) have been described using this term, and songs in its subgenre [[post-grunge]] included ballads.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}",

Ska punk tends to feature [[brass instrument]]s, especially [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s such as trumpets, trombones and woodwind instruments like saxophones, making the genre distinct from other forms of punk rock. It is closely tied to [[third wave ska]], which reached its zenith in the mid-1990s.\n\nBefore ska punk began, many ska bands and punk rock bands performed on the same bills. Some music groups from the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as [[the Clash]], the Deadbeats, [[the Specials]], [[the Beat (British band)|the Beat]], and [[Madness (band)|Madness]] fused characteristics of punk rock and ska, but many of these were punk bands playing an occasional ska-flavored song or ska bands with punk influences. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, ska-punk enjoyed its greatest success, heralded by bands such as [[Fishbone]], [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Less Than Jake]], and more.\n\nSka punk had significant mainstream success in the middle-to-late 1990s, with many bands topping pop and rock music charts. The best-selling ska punk record of the era was [[No Doubt]]'s ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'', which was certified diamond by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1999 and was certified diamond by [[Music Canada]] in 1997. By the early 2000s, many of the bands in ska punk had broken up, and the genre lost mainstream appeal, though it continued to have [[Underground music|underground]] popularity and featured a revival in the late 2010s with bands like [[The Interrupters (band)|the Interrupters]] returning to chart success, when their song \"She's Kerosene\" reached the top 5 on [[alternative rock|alternative]] and rock music charts in Canada and the US, as well as in the early 2020s with [[hyperpop]] duo [[100 gecs]] album ''[[10,000 gecs]]'' incorporating elements of ska punk to critical acclaim.",

Originally a form of [[hardcore punk]] that had been closely associated with skate culture, skate punk evolved into a more melodic genre of punk rock in the 1990s similar to [[pop punk]]. Since then, it has predominately featured fast tempos, [[lead guitar]] playing (including [[guitar riff]]s and [[guitar solo]]s), fast drumming, and singing (sometimes including vocal harmonies). Occasionally, skate punk also combines the fast tempos of hardcore punk and [[melodic hardcore]] with the catchy hooks of pop-punk.\n\n1970s and early 1980s punk rock bands like [[Buzzcocks]], [[Descendents]], [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]], [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], and [[Circle Jerks]] paved the way for skate punk. Skate punk was pioneered in the 1980s by bands such as the [[Big Boys (band)|Big Boys]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[JFA (band)|JFA]], [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Drunk Injuns]] and [[Love Canal]]. Many early skate punk bands are part of the hardcore punk movement [[nardcore]], which emerged in [[Oxnard, California]]. Skate punk band [[Bad Religion]] started the more melodic style of skate punk in 1988 with the band's influential album ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]''. This melodic style of skate punk continued in the 1990s with bands like [[NOFX]], [[Lagwagon]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]], and [[No Use for a Name]].\n\nSkate punk broke into the mainstream during the 1990s with bands such as [[the Offspring]] and [[Blink-182]]. Other bands, like NOFX, Pennywise, Face to Face, [[MxPx]] and Bad Religion, achieved underground to moderate success. Many skate punk bands' songs were featured in ''[[Tony Hawk's]]'' video games, a series that sold millions. Punk's popularity continued in the early 2000s with many bands continuing to make albums that received a lot of attention. During the 2010s, later skate punk bands such as [[Trash Boat]], [[Cerebral Ballzy]], and [[Trash Talk (band)|Trash Talk]], achieved underground success through the influence of previous skate punk bands.",

Slowcore's influences are diverse, involving varying other genres, including [[folk rock]], [[alternative rock]], and [[dream pop]]. As a result of these contrasting stylistic directions, there is no definitive characterisation of the genre.\n\nThe history of slowcore began in the late-1980s, with several bands forming in reaction to the abrasive sounds of [[grunge]]. Slow rock music, with a pensive style inspired by genres such as [[singer-songwriter]] and [[contemporary folk|folk]], laid the groundwork for the genre in the early years and until the mid-1990s, when [[Low (band)|Low]] played a pivotal role in establishing slowcore as one of the era's [[microgenre]]s; however, despite their retrospective acclamation as slowcore pioneers, Low was not the first band to produce slowcore. [[Codeine (band)|Codeine]], [[Red House Painters]], and [[Bedhead (band)|Bedhead]] all released influential albums earlier that decade, while [[American Music Club]]{{emdash}}widely considered to be the genre's first act{{emdash}}formed in 1982. Regardless, the mellow and restrained sound of Low's debut album, ''[[I Could Live in Hope]]'' (1994), and their albums that followed over the next several years, came to define slowcore. [[Spain (band)|Spain]], [[Duster (band)|Duster]], and [[Ida (band)|Ida]], among others, all followed Low and furthered the reach of the genre, and by the 2000s, slowcore had a defined sound, even if it continued to lack obvious categorisation. Artists like [[Carissa's Wierd]], [[Jason Molina]], and Duster incorporated its archetypical sound in their music throughout the introductory years of the 21st century, while others, including [[Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions]], [[Grouper (musician)|Grouper]], and [[Sun Kil Moon]], were more experimental but remained within the genre's confines. Because of slowcore's broad interpretation, observers have described several other musicians and bands as slowcore, including those outside the genre.\n\nThe term \"slowcore\" derives from \"slow\", referring to the tempo and energy of the music, and \"-core\", which refers to a scene, style, or musical [[subgenre]]. \"Sadcore\" imitates similar etymology, and the names are used interchangeably. The term itself has an unclear origin, though sources suggest the use of \"slowcore\" started in the early 1990s. Scholars and bands alike have shown ambivalence towards the name, with some deeming it pejorative.",

It is a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] genre that blends elements of Spanish and African origin. Among its fundamental Hispanic components are the vocal style, lyrical [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] and the primacy of the [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]], derived from the [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]]. On the other hand, its characteristic [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm, [[call and response]] structure and percussion section ([[bongo drum|bongo]], [[maracas]], etc.) are all rooted in traditions of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin.\n\nAround 1909 the son reached [[Havana]], where the first recordings were made in 1917. This marked the start of its expansion throughout the island, becoming Cuba's most popular and influential genre. While early groups had between three and five members, during the 1920s the ''sexteto'' ([[sextet]]) became the genre's primary format. By the 1930s, many bands had incorporated a [[trumpet]], becoming ''septetos'', and in the 1940s a larger type of ensemble featuring [[congas]] and [[piano]] became the norm: the [[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjunto]]. The son became one of the main ingredients in the jam sessions known as [[descarga]]s that flourished during the 1950s.\n\nThe international presence of the son can be traced back to the 1930s when many bands toured Europe and North America, leading to ballroom adaptations of the genre such as the American [[rhumba]]. Similarly, radio broadcasts of son became popular in West Africa and the Congos, leading to the development of hybrid genres such as [[Congolese rumba]]. In the 1960s, [[New York City|New York]]'s music scene prompted the rapid success of [[salsa music|salsa]], a combination of son and other Latin American styles primarily recorded by [[Puerto Ricans]]. While salsa achieved international popularity during the second half of the 20th century, in Cuba son evolved into other styles such as [[songo music|songo]] and [[timba]], the latter of which is sometimes known as \"Cuban salsa\".",

Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body movements, are an important hallmark of soul. Other characteristics are a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] between the lead and [[Backing vocalist|backing vocalists]],  an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional [[Musical improvisation|improvisational]] additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music is known for reflecting African-American identity and stressing the importance of African-American culture.\n  \nSoul has its roots in African-American [[gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]], and primarily combines elements of gospel, R&B and [[jazz]].  The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans' awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential in its  proliferation during the [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]]. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]]. It had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre [[neo soul]], which incorporated modern production elements and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] influences.\n\nSoul music dominated the U.S. [[R&B charts]] in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Many prominent soul artists, including [[Ray Charles]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Otis Redding]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and various acts under the Motown label, such as [[The Supremes]] and [[The Temptations]], were highly influential in the genre's development and all gained widespread popularity during this time. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists moved to [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more socially conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had begun to absorb influences from [[psychedelic rock]] and [[progressive rock]], among other genres, leading to the creation of [[psychedelic soul]] and [[progressive soul]]. Prominent soul artists of this era include [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Al Green]], and [[Bill Withers]]. [[Neo soul]], which adopted hip hop influences, emerged around 1994. \n\nOther subgenres of soul include the \"[[Motown (music style)|Motown sound]]\", a more rhythmic and [[pop music|pop]]-friendly  style that originated from the eponymous label; [[Southern soul]], a driving, energetic variety combining R&B with southern gospel music influences; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which emerged from the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; and [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] variety with [[doo-wop|doo-wop]]-inspired vocals.\nSoul music is a genre that evolved from African American popular music in the United States during the 1950s to the 1970s. It is deeply rooted in gospel and blues, characterized by intense vocal delivery, call-and-response patterns, and melisma. Soul music reinterpreted the sounds of earlier rhythm-and-blues pioneers like Chuck Berry and Ray Charles, and it was a return to African American musical roots after the emergence of rock and roll, which was seen as a white interpretation of rhythm and blues.\n\nThe style of soul music is marked by its emotional intensity and personal expression. It incorporates elements from gospel music, such as the use of church-rooted call-and-response and vocal techniques. Soul music also draws from blues, evident in its expressive and often improvisational vocal style. The genre was popularized by artists like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Otis Redding, who infused their music with themes of personal and social significance.\n\nSoul music also influenced and was influenced by other musical styles. The Motown sound, which is considered a form of soul music, had a lighter, more pop-oriented style, while Southern soul was rawer and more emotive. As the genre evolved, it contributed to the development of funk, disco, and hip-hop, with its emphasis on rhythm and groove becoming foundational to these later styles.",

Like other forms of music, the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to the cultural and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.",

Hill states that space music can range in character, the sonic texture of the music can be simple or complex, it can be instrumental or electronic, it may lack conventional melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic features, and may be less concerned with the formal compositional schemes associated with other styles of music. Hill proposes that space music can be found within a wide range of [[music genre|genres]]. Space music may have influences from [[Classical music|western classical]], [[World music|world]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], [[traditional music|traditional]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]] music.\n\nHill believes that space music can evoke a \"continuum of spatial imagery and emotion\", which can be beneficial for introspection, and for developing, through a practice of ''deep listening'', an awareness of the spatiality of sound phenomenon. This type of [[psychonaut]]ic listening can produce a subtle trance-like state in certain individuals which can in turn lead to sensations of flying, floating, cruising, gliding, or hovering.\n\nHill states that some individuals use space music for both background enhancement and foreground listening, often with headphones, to enable states of relaxation, contemplation, inspiration, and generally peaceful expansive moods; it may promote health through [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], atmospherics for [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] therapies, and effectiveness of [[meditation]]. Space music appears in many film [[soundtrack]]s and is commonly played in [[planetarium]]s.\n\nAccording to Hill space music is an [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]] music produced almost exclusively by [[independent label]]s and it occupies a small [[Niche market|niche]] in the marketplace, supported and enjoyed by a relatively small audience of loyal enthusiastic listeners.",

Spirituals encompass the \"sing songs\", [[work songs]], and plantation songs that evolved into the blues and gospel songs in church. In the nineteenth century, the word \"spirituals\" referred to all these subcategories of folk songs. While they were often rooted in biblical stories, they also described the extreme hardships endured by African Americans who were enslaved from the 17th century until the 1860s, the [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation]] altering mainly the nature (but not continuation) of slavery for many. Many new derivative music genres such as the [[blues]] emerged from the spirituals songcraft.\n\nPrior to the end of the [[US Civil War]] and emancipation, spirituals were originally an oral tradition passed from one slave generation to the next. Biblical stories were memorized then translated into song. Following emancipation, the lyrics of spirituals were published in printed form. Ensembles such as the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]]—established in 1871—popularized spirituals, bringing them to a wider, even international, audience.\n\nAt first, major recording studios were only recording white musicians performing spirituals and their derivatives. That changed with [[Mamie Smith]]'s commercial success in 1920. Starting in the 1920s, the commercial recording industry increased the audience for the spirituals and their derivatives.\n\nBlack composers [[Harry Burleigh]] and [[R. Nathaniel Dett]] created a \"new repertoire for the concert stage\" by applying their Western classical education to the spirituals. While the spirituals were created by a \"circumscribed community of people in bondage\", over time they became known as the first \"signature\" music of the United States.",

It is primarily a fusion of Jamaican [[ska]] with Trinidadian [[calypso music|calypso]], but is also influenced by a wide variety of musics from the British Isles and United States, including [[sea shanty|sea shanties]], hymns, and [[spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]], bass guitar, trap set, and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], and [[trumpet]]s. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.\n\nTwo different kinds of spouge were popular in the 1960s, ''raw spouge'' (''Draytons Two style'') and ''dragon spouge'' (''Cassius Clay style'').  The spouge industry grew immensely by the end of the 1970s, and produced popular stars such as [[The Escorts International]], [[Blue Rhythm Combo]], the [[Draytons Two]], [[The Troubadours (Barbados)|The Troubadours]], and [[Desmond Weekes]]. Desmond Weekes, the former lead singer of the Draytons Two, claims the 1973 album ''[[Raw Spouge]]'' to be \"the only 100 per cent spouge album ever produced\". The album topped the charts in a number of islands, including [[St. Kitts]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[Dominica]].\n\nIn 1950, Opel sang with a band at Coconut Creek Club, St. James, and his Jackie Wilson like voice soon made him popular. Opel appeared as a supporting act on some local shows with well-known overseas performers, and usually became the star performer as he vigorously performed every note and \"out shone\" the star. During this time, ska, the forerunner beat to reggae, was popular in Jamaica, and calypso was popular in Trinidad. Jackie Opel and his band The Troubadours developed the spouge beat as Barbados' answer to ska in Jamaica and calypso in Trinidad. Spouge became so popular that every local band and singer in Barbados and throughout the Caribbean recorded their music using the spouge beat.\n\nAfter six years, the art form declined. Today, very little spouge is played on the airwaves. Spouge is only played on Jackie Opel Day, Independence Day, Heroes Day, and Errol Barrow Day. Spouge has also declined for other reasons:\n\n#The man who created spouge, Jackie Opel, died in a car accident on March 9, 1970 at the age of 32.\n#The Barbadian media does not promote spouge to the extent that it can.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\nIn 2002, Caribbean Records Inc. released a CD entitled ''Vintage Spouge'' with hits on it such as \"Gimme Music\" by Mike Grosvenor, \"Any Day Now\" by Richard Stoute and a cover of [[Sam Cooke]]'s \"[[You Send Me]]\", sung by spouge creator Jackie Opel.\n\nIn 2024 \"Pure Spouge Gospel\" EP album was released which features five original songs written and performed by Lana Spooner-Jack in the Barbadian-owned genre Spouge. The music for the album was composed by mixing and mastering engineer Jeffrey Y. Grosvenor at his studio \"Edge Cliff\", in Gatineau, Quebec who added his own creativity by infusing African rhythms and Latin patterns. Each track on the album carries its own unique blend. The track \"Come and Buy (Isaiah 55)\" has a Meringue pattern that was altered to fit the Spouge rhythm; \"In the Same Boat\" has a Senagalese mbalax pattern. The congas are playing a Guaguancó pattern in \"Drop by Drop\"; and in the \"Christmas I Believe In\" track, the Spouge and the Cuban Bomba rhythms are played alternatively on the drum set. Very interesting combination! Of note, the song \"Singing Over Me\" is most likely the first Spouge song to be ever composed in the 3/4 time signature.",

Its [[recording studio as an instrument|studio-centric]] sound was primarily rooted in [[folk rock]] and [[easy listening]], typically featuring rich harmony vocals and [[progressive music|progressive]] elements, while lyrics combined idyllic imagery with a subtle awareness of societal change, melancholic undertones, and [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] themes. The movement initially straddled multiple styles among many groups who existed briefly while adapting to evolving music trends, resulting in much crossover with [[bubblegum music|bubblegum]], [[folk-pop]], [[garage rock]], [[baroque pop]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]].\n\nBranching from the nascent [[California sound]], its name refers to the area's regularly sundrenched weather. Many of the defining sunshine pop groups were named after fruits, colors, or abstract concepts and imitated more successful acts, principally [[the Mamas & the Papas]], led by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], and [[the 5th Dimension]], whose songs were initially helmed by [[Jimmy Webb]]. [[Curt Boettcher]] produced numerous key records for [[the Association]], [[Eternity's Children]], his band [[the Millennium (band)|the Millennium]], and with collaborator [[Gary Usher]] ([[Sagittarius (band)|Sagittarius]]). Though [[the Beach Boys]] rarely approached the style, [[Brian Wilson]]'s production of their 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' was a foundational influence on this milieu, as were the arrangements of [[Burt Bacharach]].\n\nBy the late 1960s, while most acts largely struggled to sustain commercial success amid shifting popular music trends, the sound had regional variants ranging from [[the Free Design]] in New York to [[Pic-Nic]] in Spain. In the 1970s, new waves of soft rock were heralded by acts such as [[the Carpenters]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose successes eclipsed that of many earlier groups.\n\nRenewed interest in sunshine pop, initially led by Japanese fans, developed in the 1990s among record collectors and musicians, especially those associated with Tokyo's ''[[Shibuya-kei]]'' scene, where the work of [[Roger Nichols (songwriter)|Roger Nichols]] was a central influence. Many sunshine pop records were subsequently anthologized and reissued by labels including [[Rhino Records|Rhino]] (''[[Come to the Sunshine: Soft Pop Nuggets from the WEA Vaults|Come to the Sunshine]]''), Collector's Choice, and [[Sundazed Records|Sundazed]], in addition to [[indie rock]] music circles reviving the genre's prominence.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Symphonic gothic metal''' was first pioneered by American band [[Saviour Machine]]. One of the first gothic metal bands to release a full album featuring \"beauty and the beast\" vocals, where [[death metal]] vocals are contrasted with clean female vocals, was the Norwegian [[Theatre of Tragedy]] in 1995. From then on after the departure of lead singer [[Liv Kristine]] in 2003, she and her future husband, [[Alexander Krull]], formed the symphonic metal band [[Leaves' Eyes]]. The band is one of the pioneers of the \"beauty and the beast\" vocal style. The contrasting styles of vocals are also sometimes performed by only one vocalist, an example of this being Ambre Vourvahis of [[Xandria]], combining and layering her clean (and occasionally operatic) vocals with her deep gutturals on the band's 2023 album ''[[The Wonders Still Awaiting]]''. Other bands, such as the Dutch [[Within Temptation]] in 1996, expanded on this approach. A debut album, ''[[Enter (Within Temptation album)|Enter]]'', was unveiled in the following year, followed shortly by an EP, ''[[The Dance (EP)|The Dance]]''. Both releases made use of the beauty-and-beast approach delivered by vocalists [[Sharon den Adel]] and [[Robert Westerholt]]. Their second full-length, ''[[Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)|Mother Earth]]'', was released in 2000 and dispensed entirely with the death metal vocals, instead \"relying solely on den Adel's majestic vocal ability\", apart from one [[B-side]] track that did not make the final album release. The album was a commercial success, with their lead single, \"[[Ice Queen (song)|Ice Queen]]\", topping the charts in Belgium and their native Netherlands. Their third album, ''[[The Silent Force]]'', arrived in 2004 as an \"ambitious project featuring a full orchestra and 80-voice choir accompanying the band\". The result was another commercial success across Europe and introduced \"the world of heavy guitars and female vocals\" to \"a mainstream audience\".\n\nWithin Temptation's brand of [[gothic metal]] combines \"the guitar-driven force of hard rock with the sweep and grandeur of symphonic music\". The critic Chad Bowar of [[About.com]] describes their style as \"the optimum balance\" between \"the melody and hooks of mainstream rock, the depth and complexity of classical music and the dark edge of gothic metal\". The commercial success of Within Temptation has since resulted in the emergence of a large number of other female-fronted gothic metal bands, particularly in the Netherlands. A typical example of their most symphonic sound can be heard in the songs \"Jillian (I'd give my Heart)\" and \"Our Solemn Hour\".\n\nAnother Dutch band in the symphonic gothic metal strain is [[After Forever]]. Their debut album, ''[[Prison of Desire]]'' in 2000, was \"a courageous, albeit flawed first study into an admittedly daunting undertaking: to wed heavy metal with progressive rock arrangements and classical music orchestration - then top it all off with equal parts gruesome cookie-monster vocals and a fully qualified opera singer\". Founding member, guitarist and vocalist [[Mark Jansen]] departed After Forever a few months after the release of their second album, ''[[Decipher (After Forever album)|Decipher]]''. Jansen would go on to form [[Epica (band)|Epica]], another Dutch band that performs a blend of gothic and symphonic metal. Their debut album, ''[[The Phantom Agony]]'', emerged in 2003 with music that combines Jansen's death grunts with the \"angelic tones of a classically trained [[soprano]], [[Simone Simons]], over a lush foundation of [[#Symphonic power metal|symphonic power metal]]\". The music of Epica has been described as combination of \"a dark, haunting gothic atmosphere with bombastic and symphonic music\". Like Within Temptation and After Forever, Epica has made use of an orchestra. Their 2007 album ''[[The Divine Conspiracy]]'' was a chart success in their home country.\n\nThis blend of symphonic and gothic metal has also been arrived at from the opposite direction. The band [[Nightwish]] from Finland began as a symphonic power metal act and introduced gothic elements on their 2004 album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', particularly on the single \"[[Nemo (song)|Nemo]]\". They continued to mix their style of \"bombastic, symphonic and cinematic\" metal with a gothic atmosphere on their next album, ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'', in 2007. The Swedish group [[Therion (band)|Therion]] also introduced gothic elements to their brand of symphonic metal on their 2007 album ''[[Gothic Kabbalah]]''.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Symphonic power metal''' refers to [[power metal]] bands that make extensive usage of keyboards, or instruments normally found in classical music, similar to symphonic metal. These additional elements are often used as key elements of the music when compared to regular power metal, contributing not only an extra layer to the music, but a greater variety of sound. Bands in this genre often feature clean vocals, with some bands adding relatively small quantities of screams or growls.\n\nThe first prototypical symphonic power metal song was \"[[Art of Life]]\", a twenty-nine-minute song performed by Japanese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[X Japan]] in 1993. A defining role for the style's development was played by Italian band [[Rhapsody of Fire]] since their groundbreaking 1997 debut, ''[[Legendary Tales]]'', first with a baroque approach influenced by [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]], and subsequently with a growing film-score-oriented turn employing full orchestras and choirs. The influence of symphonic and operatic music are equally audible in cognate bands [[Luca Turilli's Rhapsody]] and [[Turilli / Lione Rhapsody]]. Rhapsody's contributions to symphonic metal are best exemplified by short songs like \"Emerald Sword\", \"Dawn of Victory\" and \"Lamento Eroico\", and long suites such as \"Gargoyles, Angels of Darkness\", \"The Mystic Prophecy of the Demonknight\" and \"Erian's Mystical Rhymes\". Finnish band [[Nightwish]], who debuted the same year, also performed symphonic power metal, their style being well exemplified by songs like \"Wishmaster\" from the album ''[[Wishmaster (album)|Wishmaster]]'' and the rest of their discography until the year 2000. Since the album ''[[Century Child]]'', they gradually decreased their power metal influences, with songs like \"Ghost Love Score\" from the album ''[[Once (Nightwish album)|Once]]'', \"The Poet and the Pendulum\" from the album ''[[Dark Passion Play]]'' and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" from the album ''[[Endless Forms Most Beautiful (album)|Endless Forms Most Beautiful]]'' as the best examples of their new course making a more extensive use of orchestral elements.\n\nGerman band [[Blind Guardian]] also introduced some symphonic elements in the album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'', although it wasn't until 2002 with [[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|''A Night at the Opera'']] when they established their symphonic power metal style, mainly with the song \"And Then There Was Silence\". They gradually composed more and more symphonic songs such as \"Sacred Worlds\" and \"Wheel of Time\", both featured on the album ''[[At the Edge of Time]]'', and \"The Ninth Wave\", \"At the Edge of Time\", \"The Throne\" and \"Grand Parade\" from their latest album, ''[[Beyond the Red Mirror]]''. They also made orchestral versions of previously released songs like \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Theatre of Pain\", both included on the compilation album ''[[The Forgotten Tales]]''. Blind Guardian went deeper into symphonic music with the album ''[[Legacy of the Dark Lands]]'', a fully orchestral album composed by singer [[Hansi Kürsch]] and guitarist [[André Olbrich]] that kept the band's spirit but was credited to the Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra, as Hansi was the only member of the band to perform on the album.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Several of the most widely known symphonic power metal bands\">\nTwilight Force Rockharz 2016 24.jpg|[[Twilight Force]]\nKamelot_in_2019_with_Lauren_Hart.jpg|[[Kamelot]]\nRhapsody Buenos Aires 2010.JPG|[[Rhapsody of Fire]]\nNightwish au Rockhal 2015.JPG|[[Nightwish]]\nEpica - Wacken Open Air 2018-0909.jpg|[[Epica (band)|Epica]]\nBlind Guardian Group.jpg|[[Blind Guardian]]\n</gallery>",

It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in [[progressive rock]], [[electronic music|electronic]], [[art rock]], [[disco]], and particularly the [[Krautrock]] of bands like [[Kraftwerk]]. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the [[post-punk]] era as part of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement of the late 1970s.\n\nElectronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, and the mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians. After the breakthrough of [[Gary Numan]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s. In Japan, [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] introduced the [[TR-808]] rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts. The development of inexpensive [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic]] synthesizers, the definition of [[MIDI]] and the use of [[Dance music|dance]] beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. Thus, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the [[New Romantic]] movement, together with the rise of [[MTV]], led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts in the US during the [[Second British Invasion]].\n\nThe term \"techno-pop\" was coined by Yuzuru Agi in his critique of Kraftwerk's ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' in 1978 and is considered a case of [[multiple discovery]] of naming. Hence, the term can be used interchangeably with \"synth-pop\", but is more frequently used to describe the scene of Japan. The term \"techno-pop\" became also popular in Europe, where it started: German band Kraftwerk's 1986 album was titled ''[[Techno Pop]]''; English band [[the Buggles]] has a song named [[The Age of Plastic|\"Technopop\"]] and Spanish band [[Mecano]] described their style as tecno-pop.\n\n\"Synth-pop\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"[[electropop]]\", but \"electropop\" may also denote a variant of synth-pop that places more emphasis on a harder, more electronic sound.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=107}} In the mid to late 1980s, duos such as [[Erasure (duo)|Erasure]] and [[Pet Shop Boys]] adopted a style that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade, the synth-pop of bands such as [[A-ha]] and [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] was giving way to [[house music]] and [[techno]]. Interest in synth-pop began to revive in the [[indietronica]] and [[electroclash]] movements in the late 1990s, and in the 2000s synth-pop enjoyed a widespread revival and commercial success.\n\nThe genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Synth-pop music has established a place for the synthesizer as a major element of [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], directly influencing subsequent genres (including [[house music]] and [[Detroit techno]]) and has indirectly influenced many other genres, as well as individual recordings.",

Curaçaoan tambu is a major part of that island's culture, and is there a genre that is considered ''muziek di zumbi'' (literally, ''spirit music'', referring to music of African origin), and is accompanied by instruments like the ''wiri'', ''agan'' and [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]. The word ''tambu'' derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for drum, ''tambor''.\n\nThe origins of Tambú can be traced back to the early 17th century, where a large number of African slaves arrived in Curaçao from Angola. The ritual was first associated with the Curaçao style of stick fighting called ''kokomakaku,'' where the Tambú referred to the rhythms played by the drummer (called a ''tamburero'') on a single drum (also referred to as ''tambú''). Since then, the performance has changed in congruence with the historical circumstances of the Curaçao island.\n\n''Tambu'' can refer to the small drum on which the music is played, the dance that accompanies the music, or the event where the music and dance take place. In modern ''tambu'', the lyrics are usually in the [[Papiamento|Papiamento language]] and are sung along with a ''chapi'' (hoe), the ''tambu'' drum and sometimes other singers, while the audience claps to the rhythm. The ''tambu'' rhythm is complicated and is passed down orally from generation to generation. ''Tambu'' consists of two beats; ''sla habri'' and ''sla será'', the open and closed beat respectively. These beats alternate to create a musical dialogue. The lead vocalists are known for their skilful wordplay when delivering the performance's message. Additionally, there are two types of ''tambu'' music; ''telele'', which is a long, slow rising and falling melody, and ''tambu'' itself, which is faster paced and shorter in duration.",

      "wikitext_description": "'''Techno''' is a [[Music genre|genre]] of [[electronic dance music]] (EDM) which is generally [[Record producer|produced]] for use in a continuous [[DJ mix|DJ set]], with [[tempo]]s being in the range from 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm). The central [[Drum beat|rhythm]] is typically in [[Time signature#common time|common time]] ([[Time signature|{{music|time|4|4}}]]) and often characterized by a repetitive [[Four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] [[Beat (music)|beat]]. Artists may use [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instruments]] such as [[drum machine]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], and [[synthesizer]]s, as well as [[digital audio workstation]]s. Drum machines from the 1980s such as [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]'s [[Roland TR-808]] and [[Roland TR-909]] are highly prized, and [[Software synthesizer|software emulations]] of such [[Retro style|retro]] instruments are popular in this style.\n\nMuch of the instrumentation in techno is used to emphasize the role of [[rhythm]] over other [[Elements of music|musical aspects]]. [[Singing|Vocals]] and [[Melody|melodies]] are uncommon. The use of [[sound synthesis]] in developing distinctive [[timbre]]s tends to feature more prominently. Typical [[Harmony|harmonic]] practices found in other forms of music are often ignored in favor of repetitive sequences of notes. More generally the creation of techno is heavily dependent on [[Music technology|music production technology]].\n\nUse of the term \"techno\" to refer to a type of [[electronic music]] originated in [[Germany]] in the early 1980s. In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation ''[[Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit]]'', the term came to be associated with a form of EDM produced in Detroit. [[Detroit techno]] resulted from the melding of [[synth-pop]] by artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] with [[African American music|African American styles]] such as [[house music|house]], [[Electro (music)|electro]], and [[funk]]. Added to this is the influence of [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] and [[science-fiction]] themes relevant to life in contemporary American society, with [[Alvin Toffler]]'s book ''[[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|The Third Wave]]'' a notable point of reference. The music produced in the mid-to-late 1980s by [[Juan Atkins]], [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]], and [[Kevin Saunderson]] (collectively known as [[The Belleville Three]]), along with [[Eddie Fowlkes]], [[Blake Baxter]], [[James Pennington]] and others is viewed as the ''first wave'' of techno from Detroit.\n\nAfter the success of house music in [[Europe]], techno grew in popularity in the [[United Kingdom]], Germany, [[Belgium]] and The [[Netherlands]]. Regional variants quickly evolved and by the early 1990s techno subgenres such as [[Acid techno|acid]], [[Hardcore (electronic dance music genre)|hardcore]], [[Bleep techno|bleep]], [[Ambient techno|ambient]], and [[dub techno]] had developed. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term, so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as [[tech house]] and [[Trance music|trance]].",

However, the style of music was developed throughout South America with different names given to it before the name \"Tecnocumbia\" was adopted as the single denomination for the music.\n\nIn Mexico, it developed as a variant of the [[Mexican cumbia]] that started in the early 1980s. The style added electronic instruments along with [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] to the Mexican cumbia music. One of the first musical groups with electrical 1980s sounds was [[Super Show de los Vazkez]] from [[Veracruz]], México, formed in 1981, also, other important exponents were [[Los Temerarios]], [[Los Bukis]], [[Fito Olivares]], among others. These groups created several hits with electrical sounds, their fame continues to the end of the 1980s. In the early 1990s, [[Selena]] the \"Tex-Mex queen,\" had great musical hits in U.S. and Mexico, her main hits of the tecnocumbia style was ''\"Como la flor\" (Like a flower), \"Carcacha\" (the old car)'', and, for first time, this genre was called like ''\"Technocumbia\"'' by her, with the musical hit of same name, ''\"Technocumbia\"''.\n\nIn South America, where the Colombian [[Cumbia]] most easily expanded in popularity, different \"modern\" styles of the original Colombian rhythm were started mainly in the countries of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. The [[Peruvian cumbia]], developed in the early 1960s, used [[electric guitar]]s and [[synthesisers]] along with the other classical instruments of the Colombian cumbia in order to create a kind of [[Amazon Rainforest|tropical]] sound. Variations within the Peruvian cumbia added more tropical rhythms along with a more Andean flavor, which eventually resulted in the creation of the [[Andean cumbia]] (Commonly called \"Chicha music\" in Peru). Using the Andean cumbia as a base, in the middle of the 1990s the Tecnocumbia sprung up in Peru and since then has gone through many changes in Peru and Bolivia. [[Rossy War]] was the most important singer of the Peruvian tecnocumbia, she recorded several hits for Peru and Mexico, but her fame was bigger in the U.S.A's Latin community. Finally in the north of Argentina the most recent exponents are the group [[Kasualidad]] and [[Lagrimas (group)|Lagrimas]].\nIn Ecuador, this style of music began in 1992 with Grupo Coctel and; later, in 1999 with [[Sharon la Hechicera]] and Widinson. They are considered the beginners of this music in Ecuador. After them male and female groups appeared like Tierra Canela, Magia Latina, Las Chicas Dulces, Deseo, Kandela y Son, Yerba Buena, Milenium, Batahola and others singers like [[Jazmín (singer)|Jazmín]], [[Jaime Enrique Aymara]], Hipatia Balseca, Sanyi, Mayra Alvarado, Milena, Enrique Augusto, Manolo and Silvana. Nowadays the most important singers of tecnocumbia are Maria de los Angeles, Gerardo Morán, Patty Ray, Omayra, Veronica Bolaños, Katty Egas and [[Delfin Quishpe]].\n\nIn Chile, a similar style is known as [[Sound (cumbia)|Sound]] or [[Sound (cumbia)|Música Tropical]].\n\nThe Mexican and South American tecnocumbias have similar styles and rhythms, due to them both having the Colombia cumbia as a base, but they developed through different methods independently of each other and do not sound exactly alike.",

It also drew heavily on genres from the [[British Invasion]], including [[rock and roll]], [[garage rock]] and Hollywood film soundtracks. Since the 1980s, it has mixed with other genres, such as [[disco]], [[funk]] and [[dance music|dance]].",

It could refer to a group of jazz musicians playing solely, or a jazz soloist performing with a symphony orchestra, as long as the musicians are able to interpret and play jazz music. Improvisation is generally seen as a vital component of third stream.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica}} In third-stream music, composers incorporate elements of classical music, such as the use of classical instruments and classical music forms, into their jazz compositions. The fusion of jazz and classical music is also viewed as \"born out of a reciprocal interest: the interest of the classical community in the developments in jazz music and the interest of the jazz community in the advances of classical music.\" The innovative idea of fusing jazz and classical music pushed the boundaries of traditional classical music and introduced a new genre that blends the two styles into a unique hybrid form.",

The genre was commercially successful from approximately 1985 through 1991, bringing prominence to [[Metallica]], [[Slayer]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], all grouped together as the \"Big Four\" of U.S. thrash metal.

      "wikitext_description": "'''Traditional bluegrass''', as the name implies, emphasizes the traditional elements of [[bluegrass music]], and stands in contrast to [[progressive bluegrass]].  Traditional bluegrass musicians play folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and on [[acoustic instrument]]s of a type that were played by bluegrass pioneer [[Bill Monroe]] and his [[Blue Grass Boys]] band in the late 1940s.  Traditional bands may use their instruments in slightly different ways, for example by using multiple guitars or fiddles in a band.\n\nBluegrass music developed between 1939 and 1945, largely shaped by Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys, with Monroe being the central figure in its creation. While the style is closely associated with Kentucky, many early bluegrass musicians hailed from other southern states, particularly Appalachia. Despite its global spread and evolving variations, bluegrass continues to maintain its ties to its southern and Appalachian roots.\n\nPopularized by the Monroe brothers from Kentucky, bluegrass music relies on acoustic stringed instruments like the fiddle, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin, and upright bass, often accompanied by a resonator guitar. Characterized by \"high lonesome sound\" vocal harmonies, it emphasizes traditional, sentimental songs. Each instrument plays a key role: the mandolin is a defining feature, the banjo is crucial for its signature sound, and the upright bass provides the deep foundation. Other instruments, such as the Dobro and fiddle, further contribute to the genre's distinctive style.\n\nIn some traditional bluegrass bands, the guitar rarely takes the lead, instead acting as a rhythm instrument, one notable exception being [[Gospel music|gospel-based songs]]. Melodies and lyrics tend to be simple, sometimes in the [[key of G]] or other keys, and a I-IV-V chord pattern is common.  Although traditional bluegrass performers do not use electrically amplified instruments, as used in other forms of popular music, it is common practice to \"[[microphone|mike]]\" acoustic instruments during stage performances before larger audiences.\n\nBluegrass music is often defined by its distinctive features, such as the three-finger banjo picking, smooth, bluesy fiddling, and high-pitched, tense vocal harmonies. While it traditionally relies on acoustic instruments and avoids electric bass and drums, these elements are now more commonly accepted. Originally set apart from mainstream country music due to its emphasis on nostalgia and rural myths, bluegrass has since incorporated influences from genres like country-western, western swing, folk-rock, and jazz.\n\nBill Monroe's mandolin playing style and Kenny Baker's fiddling set the standard for traditional bluegrass musicians on those instruments.  [[Earl Scruggs]] is recognized as the developer of bluegrass three finger style banjo playing.\n\nDespite bluegrass's association with rural Appalachia, a significant portion of its early history actually took place in urban settings. In the 1940s, bluegrass music emerged as a response to the experiences of people living between the country and the city. Over time, however, the genre became increasingly associated with an \"authentic\" rural identity. This shift in perception highlights the evolving cultural narrative surrounding bluegrass, with rural imagery becoming more dominant in popular portrayals of the genre's ideological divisions even among traditional bluegrass bands.\n\nThere are ideological divisions even among traditional bluegrass bands.  These divisions center on the longstanding debate about what constitutes \"Bluegrass Music\".  A few traditional bluegrass musicians do not consider progressive bluegrass to truly be \"bluegrass\", some going so far as to suggest bluegrass must be styled directly after Bill Monroe's bands.  However, stylistic divergences in traditional bluegrass generally center on which first generation bands from which contemporary musicians have drawn inspiration.  Examples include bands who sing in the [[Stanley Brothers]] tradition: [[Roy Lee Centers]], [[Larry Sparks]], Sammy Adkins, The Fields Bros, The Wilson Brothers, The [[Gillis Brothers]] and various local bands across the country.  Other bands followed [[Lester Flatt]], such as Willis Spears, Curley Seckler and Karl Shifflett.  [[Mac Wiseman]]'s \"crooning\" style of Bluegrass engendered [[Hylo Brown]] and Sid Campbell.  The [[Osborne Brothers]] have followers in Larry Stephenson as well as the Grascals.  Frank Necessary, Blue Maggie and Hud Hadley were strongly influenced by [[Jimmy Martin]].",

Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as [[techno]], [[House music|house]],  [[Chill-out music|chill-out]], [[classical music]], [[tech house]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[film music|film scores]].\n\nA [[trance]] is a state of [[Hypnosis|hypnotism]] and heightened [[consciousness]]. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of modern trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by [[DJs]].\n\nTrance is mostly [[Instrumental music|instrumental]], although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, mostly without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the [[vocal trance]] subgenre, which has been described as \"grand, soaring, and operatic\" and \"ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths\". However, male singers, such as Jonathan Mendelsohn, are also featured.",

The genre gets its name from the [[Atlanta]] slang term \"[[trap house]]\", a house used exclusively to sell drugs. Trap music is known for its simple, rhythmic, minimalistic productions that use synthesized drums, and is characterized by complex [[hi-hat]] [[Drum beat|patterns]], [[snare drum]]s, [[Bass drum|bass drums]], some tuned with a long [[Envelope (music)|decay]] to emit a bass frequency (originally from the [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]]), and lyrical content that often focuses on drug use and urban violence.\n\nPioneers of the genre include producers [[DJ Spanish Fly]], [[DJ Paul]] & [[Juicy J]], [[Kurtis Mantronik]], [[Mannie Fresh]], [[Shawty Redd]], Fatboi, [[Zaytoven]], [[DJ Screw]], and [[DJ Toomp]], along with rappers [[T.I.]], [[Jeezy]], and [[Gucci Mane]]. The style was popularized by [[Record producer|producer]] [[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]], who produced the influential [[Waka Flocka Flame]] album ''[[Flockaveli]]'' in 2010, and cofounded the prolific [[hip-hop production]] team [[808 Mafia]].\n\nSince crossing over into the mainstream in the 2010s, trap has become one of the most popular forms of American music, consistently dominating the [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] throughout the decade, with artists such as [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Playboi Carti]], [[21 Savage]], [[Migos]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Post Malone]], [[XXXTentacion]], [[DaBaby]], [[Roddy Ricch]], [[Young Thug]], and [[Travis Scott]] (among many others) all achieving No. 1s on the chart with songs featuring production inspired by the trap subgenre. It has influenced the music of many pop and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] artists, such as [[Ariana Grande]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Rihanna]], [[The Weeknd]], [[Sabrina Carpenter]] and more. Its influence can also be heard in [[reggaetón]] and [[K-pop]]. In 2018, hip-hop became the most popular form of music for the first time ever (according to [[Nielsen Data]]), coinciding with trap's continued rise in popularity. 2019 saw trap-influenced hits amass high commercial success such as Ariana Grande's \"[[7 Rings]]\" spending eight weeks at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and the country-trap song \"[[Old Town Road]]\" by [[Lil Nas X]] (featuring [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]), which broke the record for spending the most weeks (19) on top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, as well as becoming the fastest song to reach a [[Music recording certification|Diamond Certification]].",

It was characterized by the amalgamation of Brazilian genres—notably the union of the [[pop culture|popular]] and the [[avant-garde]], as well as the melding of Brazilian tradition and foreign traditions and styles. Today, tropicália is chiefly associated with the musical faction of the movement, which merged [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian]] and [[Music of Africa|African rhythms]] with British and American [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[pop rock]]. The movement also included works of film, theatre, and poetry.\n\nThe term tropicália (tropicalismo) has multiple connotations in that it played on images of Brazil being that of a \"tropical paradise\". Tropicalia was presented as a \"field for reflection on social history\". \nThe movement was begun by a group of musicians from [[Bahia]] notably [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and the poet-lyricist [[Torquato Neto]]. Later the group moved from [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] (the capital of Bahia) to [[São Paulo]] where they met with collaborators [[Os Mutantes]] and [[Rogério Duprat]] among others. They went on to produce the 1968 album ''[[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis]]'', which served as the movement's manifesto.\n\nTropicália was not only an expression in analyzing and manipulating culture but also a mode of political expression. The tropicália movement came to fruition at a time when Brazil's [[Military dictatorship in Brazil|military dictatorship]] and left-wing ideas held distinct but prominent amounts of power simultaneously. The tropicalists' rejection of both sides' version of nationalism (the military's conservative patriotism and the ineffectual bourgeois anti-imperialism) was met with criticism and harassment.\n\nThe dissolution of the movement by the early 1970s gave rise to a new wave of soloists and groups identifying as “post-tropicalist”. The movement has inspired many artists nationally and internationally. Additionally, tropicalia continues to be a main feature in the original Bahian group and their fellows’ work.",

Originating during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century, trot was influenced by many genres of Korean, Japanese, American, and European music.\n\nTrot has been around for almost 100 years and its distinct singing style has been continuously evolving. Trot music developed in rhythms during Japanese colonial rule. After the liberation of the Korean peninsula and the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953), artists such as [[Lee Mi-Ja]], Choi Sook-ja, [[Bae Ho]], [[Nam Jin]], [[Na Hun-a]], [[Joo Hyun-mi]] and many others helped to make trot popular. With the rise of [[K-pop]] from the 1990s onwards, trot music lost some popularity and was viewed as more old-fashioned. However, from the 2000s onwards, young trot singers such as [[Jang Yoon-jeong (singer)|Jang Yoon-jeong]], [[Hong Jin-young]], K-pop singers such as [[Super Junior-T]], [[Daesung]], [[MJ (South Korean singer)|MJ]] and [[Lizzy (singer)|Lizzy]], renewed interest in the genre and popularised it among young listeners.\n\nAlthough the genre originated before the division of the Korean peninsula, it is actually now mainly sung in [[South Korea]]; the associated pop culture, together with nursery rhymes, new folk songs in [[North Korea]] were categorized as \"Enlightenment Period song\" (계몽기 가요). It is no longer composed as [[Propaganda through media|propaganda music]] has since displaced other musical forms.{{clarification needed |date=May 2024}} Those songs were only orally-recorded.

The development of UK rap was shaped by a distinct set of regional influences, slang, and grassroots movements that differentiated it from American hip hop.\nIt is generally classified as one of a number of styles of [[urban music|R&B/hip-hop]]. British hip hop can also be referred to as '''Brit-hop''', a term coined and popularised mainly by ''[[British Vogue]]'' magazine and the [[BBC]]. British hip hop was originally influenced by the [[Deejay (Jamaican)|dub/toasting]] introduced to the United Kingdom by Jamaican migrants in the 1950s–70s, who eventually developed uniquely influenced rapping (or speed-toasting) in order to match the rhythm of the ever-increasing pace and aggression of Jamaican-influenced [[Dub music|dub]] in the UK. Toasting and [[Sound system (Jamaican)|soundsystem]] cultures were also influential in genres outside of hip hop that still included [[rapping]] – such as [[Grime (music genre)|grime]], [[Jungle music|jungle]], and [[UK garage]].\n\nIn 2003, ''[[The Times]]'' described British hip hop's broad-ranging approach:\n\n<blockquote>...\"UK hip-hop\" is a broad sonic church, encompassing anything made in Britain by musicians informed or inspired by hip-hop's possibilities, whose music is a response to the same stimuli that gave birth to rap in New York in the mid-Seventies.</blockquote>Although the underground scene was well established by the late 1980s, UK rap music saw little commercial success for several decades. Outside of a few exceptions such as [[Derek B]] and later the birth of [[Trip hop|trip-hop]], from the 1980s until the early 2010s UK rap made up a small percentage of album sales in the domestic market. Performers saw wider success in the 2020s, including [[Stormzy]] headlining [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Dave (rapper)|Dave]] releasing back-to-back UK number one albums with ''[[Psychodrama (album)|Psychodrama]]'' followed by ''[[We're All Alone in This Together]]'', and [[Little Simz]] winning the [[Mercury Prize]].",

The name \"ultra\" is a shortening of \"ultramodernen\".  The movement had an avantgarde, experimental, and artistic aesthetic.  Many of its participants were students in art schools.  In contrast to other countries' post-punk movements, the Dutch experimented with, among other things, toy instruments, chainsaws and de-tuned guitars.\n\nThere were four main strands involved with ultra music:\n# [[Dutch Punk]] bands from Amsterdam that embraced experimental music: most notably [[The Ex (band) | The Ex]] and [https://www.discogs.com/artist/328028-Morzelpronk Morzelpronk], led by Dolf Planteijdt, who ran a recording studio called the Koeienverhuurbedrijf (Cow Rental Company).\n# Amsterdam art students: most notably the [[Minny Pops]] led by Wally van Middendorp of the record label [https://www.discogs.com/label/12919-Plurex-Records Plurex]).

Stephen Emmer (the guitarist of the Minny Pops) and Arjen Schrama (the guitarist of the band Tox Modell) were the founders of this magazine. André Bach and Mark Tegefoss (also of Tox Modell) were involved and Harold Schellinx (of the band The Young Lions) served as an editor. The magazine's ambition was to create a new journalism that reflected the new music.  Vinyl not only acted as a voice for the movement, but also released the music of ultra bands on flexidisc, with every issue of the magazine accompanied by a free record.  The most representative compilation of the ultra movement was the C-90 cassette ''[https://www.discogs.com/de/release/1095034-Various-Ultra Ultra]'', released in 1981 on the Amsterdam label [https://www.discogs.com/label/73697-Lebel-Period Lebel PERIOD], a Dutch record label associated with Tox Modell, and run by Marc Tegefoss and Det Wiehl.  Most of the tracks on this album are untitled.\n\nThe band [[:nl:The Young Lions (band)|The Young Lions]] played a central role in defining the ultra movement and distinguished it as an abstract and conceptual musical direction.  The Young Lions was active from mid-1979 to early 1981.  The band consisted of the art students Rob Scholte (on drums), Ronald Heiloo (electric piano), Tim Benjamin (guitar), and Harold Schellinx (wonder instrument).  The group began practicing in the basement of the Rietveld art school. The eleven songs on their cassette ''Small World'' were composed in sequence during one uninterrupted, almost 24-hour studio session; these songs were performed live only once.  Scholte described the band's objective as \"to show punk where it had messed up\".  The goal was not to produce punk music, but to take a different, more artistic approach to punk.  Their rare performances often inspired violence and aggression from the audience, who did not understand their objectives.  Scholte has discussed how the audience would throw beer, climb onstage, and try to break their equipment.\n\nThe most successful and internationally recognized ultra band was the [[Minny Pops]], founded in 1978 by Wally van Middendorp (who also founded the record label [https://www.discogs.com/label/12919-Plurex-Records Plurex]). The band consisted of van Middendorp, Frans Hagenaars (bass), Peter Mertens (guitar). The [[Minny Pops]] toured internationally and opened for [[Joy Division]].\n\nWeekly ultra nights were organized at the Oktopus club in Amsterdam between September 1980 and March 1981. Organizers were Wally van Middendorp, Rob Scholte, and Harold Schellinx.",

It is defined partly by its slowed-down, [[chopped and screwed]] samples of [[smooth jazz]], 1970s [[elevator music]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[lounge music]] from the 1980s and 1990s; similar to [[synthwave]]. The surrounding [[subculture]] is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on [[consumer capitalism]] and [[pop culture]], and tends to be characterized by a [[nostalgic]] or [[surrealist]] engagement with the [[popular entertainment]], technology and [[advertising]] of previous decades. Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, [[glitch art]], [[anime]], stylized [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Ancient Greek]] or [[Roman sculpture]]s, [[3D rendering|3D-rendered]] objects, and [[cyberpunk]] tropes in its cover artwork and [[music video]]s.\n\nVaporwave originated as an ironic variant of [[chillwave]], evolving from [[hypnagogic pop]] as well as similar retro-revivalist and [[post-Internet]] motifs that had become fashionable in underground digital music and art scenes of the era, such as [[Tumblr]]'s [[seapunk]]. The style was pioneered by producers such as [[James Ferraro]], [[Daniel Lopatin]] and [[Vektroid|Ramona Langley]], who each used various pseudonyms. After Langley's album ''[[Floral Shoppe]]'' (2011) established a blueprint for the genre, the movement built an audience on sites [[Last.fm]], [[Reddit]] and [[4chan#/mu/|4chan]] while a flood of new acts, also operating under online pseudonyms, turned to [[Bandcamp]] for distribution.\n\nFollowing the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, [[mallsoft]] and [[hardvapour]], although most have waned in popularity. The genre also intersected with fashion trends such as [[streetwear]] and various political movements. Since the mid-2010s, vaporwave has been frequently described as a \"dead\" genre.{{sfn|Harper|2017|p=121}} The general public came to view vaporwave as a facetious Internet meme, a notion that frustrated some producers who wished to be recognized as serious artists. Many of the most influential artists and record labels associated with vaporwave have since drifted into other musical styles. Later in the 2010s, the genre spurred a revival of interest in Japanese [[ambient music]] and [[city pop]]  and in the 2020s with the spread of its latest subgenre, [[Frutiger Aero]], sharing its name with the graphical style.",

Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically heard as [[black metal]] with influences from [[Nordic folk music]]. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy [[Ostinato#Riff|riffing]] style, [[anthem]]ic choruses, use of both sung and [[harsh vocals]], a reliance on [[folk instrument]]ation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect.\n\nViking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an [[Anti-Christian sentiment#Europe|opposition to Christianity]], but rejecting [[Satanism]] and [[occult|occult themes]] in favor of the [[Vikings]] and [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|paganism]]. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to [[pagan metal]], but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the [[Nordic countries]], and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and [[folk metal]] genres as part of the broader [[modern Paganism|modern Pagan movements]], as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.\n\nThough artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], [[Heavy Load (band)|Heavy Load]], [[Manowar]], and many others had previously dealt with Viking themes, [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with ''[[Hordanes Land]]'' (1993) and ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'' (1994). [[Burzum]], [[Emperor (Norwegian band)|Emperor]], [[Einherjer]], and [[Helheim (band)|Helheim]], among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band [[Falkenbach]], Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to other nations with Viking history or an even broader [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] heritage and has since influenced musicians across the globe. The [[death metal]] bands [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], [[Amon Amarth]], and [[Ensiferum]], which emerged in the early 1990s, also adopted Viking themes, broadening the style from its primarily black metal origin.",

While visual kei acts can be of any music genre, it originated with bands influenced by [[glam rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]] and [[gothic rock]].\n\nVisual kei was pioneered by groups such as [[X Japan]], [[Dead End (band)|Dead End]], [[Buck-Tick]], [[D'erlanger]], and [[Color (band)|Color]], and gained further notoriety in the 1990s through the success of groups like [[Luna Sea]], [[Glay]], [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]], and [[Malice Mizer]]. The movement's success continued through the 2000s with [[Gackt]] and more musically broad bands such as [[Dir En Grey]], [[The Gazette (band)|the Gazette]], [[Alice Nine]], [[Girugamesh]], and [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]], a period which some critics term {{nihongo|\"neo-visual kei\"|ネオ・ヴィジュアル系}}.

The music is an amalgamation of [[American roots music|rural]], [[Western music (North America)|cowboy]], [[polka]], [[Old-time music|old-time]], [[Dixieland jazz]], and [[blues]] blended with [[swing music|swing]]; and played by a [[Musical improvisation|hot]] string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the [[steel guitar]]. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included overtones of [[bebop]].\n\nWestern swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven [[Big band|big swing bands]] of the same era. In Western bands, even fully orchestrated bands, vocals, and other instruments followed the fiddle's lead, though like popular horn-led bands that arranged and scored their music, most Western bands improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively.\n\nAccording to country singer [[Merle Travis]], \"Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my friend, you have Western swing.\"",

It's also usual for producers to take influences from [[cloud rap]] such as lushy synth pads and reverb-heavy atmospheric production.\n\nForza has been credited with tuning 808s into a unique style that would later develop into tread. According to [[WOBC-FM]], production by Forza included \"his signature high tempo drums and unconventional 808 patterns that automatically makes you want to mosh\", describing him as \"a pioneer in the underground’s Soundcloud scene\". One of the first works recognized as proliferating tread rap was 5 Finger Posse's mixtape ''Trapped in the Trenches'', produced by Working on Dying.\n\nAs tread became more established, Working on Dying would then promote their music through weekly releases called \"Tread Tuesdays\", a play on [[Kanye West]]'s [[GOOD Fridays]]. Various rappers would be involved with the popularity of tread rap including [[Lucki]], [[Lil Yachty]], [[Black Kray]], WiFiGawd, 5 Finger Posse, Chxpo and others. The collective's persistent promotion through live performances, internet streams and consistent releases would pay off and bring them into the mainstream rap scene.",
